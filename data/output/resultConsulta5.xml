  <title>How can I figure out how much caffeine is in my cup?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I haven't been able to find a good way to approximate the amount of caffeine in the coffee I make. Googling yields information like &lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20049372"&gt;this Mayo Clinic article&lt;/a&gt; that mixes serving sizes and brewing methods, and it reports one 8 oz coffee contains "95-200 mg" of caffeine, which is a huge range. If I have three cups of coffee in a day, is that 300 or 600 mg of caffeine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many variables in prepared coffee, different extraction methods, beans, roasts, serving sizes, mixed with different amounts of water or milk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a general method for calculating the caffeine in prepared coffee?&lt;/strong&gt; Something like "most brewing methods extract &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; mg of caffeine from each &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; grams of ground coffee"?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or more specifically, what method would I use to accurately estimate how much caffeine is in an 8oz serving from my 10 oz french press, made with medium- (not course-) ground medium-roast arabica beans, brewed 4 minutes before decanting?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I read everyone's answer and did some of my own research to find an estimation method that satisfies me and might be helpful to others too. I think it should be roughly ±20% accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;For any amount of "good strength" American-style coffee by any brew method, weigh the dry coffee in grams and multiply by 0.008, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weakly extracted coffee might yield 0.6% of its weight in caffeine and very strongly extracted coffee might get close to 1% caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers are for typical 100% Arabica or mostly Arabica blends. 100% Robusta beans (uncommon) could be about double the caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explanation below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Maximum caffeine content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical premium roasted Arabica coffee beans like mine contain &lt;a href="http://www.academia.edu/6246212/Analytical_Methods_Measurement_of_caffeine_in_coffee_beans_with_UV_vis_spectrometer" rel="noreferrer"&gt;close to 1% caffeine by mass when measured by spectrophotometer (p 311)&lt;/a&gt;
though Robusta (less common and usually blended with Arabica in cheaper coffees) has
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee" rel="noreferrer"&gt;roughly twice that
much&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a health concern like wanting to stay under the 300 mg guideline for pregnant women, you should be able to use this as the upper limit: &lt;strong&gt;each 10g of Arabica coffee contains about 100mg of caffeine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a 2 Tbsp scoop to measure beans before I grind them. One scoop of
beans weighs about &lt;strong&gt;12 grams&lt;/strong&gt; (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh
once and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight
and volume).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NwqDW.jpg" alt="2Tbsp scoop of beans weighing 12g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if I &lt;em&gt;eat&lt;/em&gt; that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them
with any amount of water I will be consuming the &lt;strong&gt;120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine&lt;/strong&gt;
present in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation
exercise. &lt;em&gt;The strongest &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with
that scoop of beans will have &lt;strong&gt;no more than&lt;/strong&gt; 120mg caffeine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How strong is my cup?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in 
&lt;a href="http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-1.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1% (weak) to 1.65% (too strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%
considered optimal&lt;/a&gt; whereas 
&lt;a href="http://www.coffeechemistry.com/brewing/brewing-fundamentals.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;"a typical espresso will contain on average 1.8-2.2%"
solids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So 1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water
(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 300-600mg, or 380mg solids for optimal brewed coffee and 600mg solids for espresso). That would be the upper limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand,the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,so even though it's only 1% of the mass of the beans it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part. Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with &lt;a href="http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;8-15 mg caffeine per oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz&lt;/a&gt;. That's a pretty huge range. It means caffeine is 2.5-4.0% of the solids (380 mg) in an ounce of "optimal" brewed coffee or 5.0-8.3% of the solids (600 mg) in an ounce of espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of
beans containing a maximum of 120mg (or 1% of the coffee mass) caffeine. So let's say this maximum 12 mg caffeine per each oz of coffee corresponds to 1.65% or 500 mg solids (1.65% of 29.57 gr = 500 mg). In this case the 12 mg caffeine is 2.4% of the solids. If I brew it "too weak" and it ends up 1% solids (or 300 mg per oz) I would guess I'd proportionally get no more than 60% of the max caffeine, 7.2 mg (again 2.4% of the solids) per oz or 72 mg for a 10oz cup. So that narrows the range to 72-120 mg of caffeine in my cup depending on the brew strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing a good cup ends up somewhere in the middle, so I'm going to estimate my typical cup contains &lt;strong&gt;around 100 mg of caffeine from its 12g dry coffee,&lt;/strong&gt; or about 80% of the maximum caffeine present in the beans. From this I would suggest a decent rule of thumb for "optimal" strength American-style brewed coffee is around &lt;strong&gt;0.8% (or 0.008) of the mass of the beans used, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bonus corollary/sanity check&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the same method, a shot of espresso made with &lt;a href="http://www.coffeeforums.com/forum/coffee-drinks/2733-how-much-grounds-used-make-espresso.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;7g of ground
coffee&lt;/a&gt; maxes out around 70mg caffeine (77mg if 10% Robusta sometimes typical for Espresso blends), but the serving size and strength are more standardized than brewed coffee, so the &lt;strong&gt;64mg/shot&lt;/strong&gt; reported by &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/#q=caffeine%20in%20espresso" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the USDA and others&lt;/a&gt; also ends up being 80-90% of the caffeine present in the beans.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How should I store whole bean coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just got a pound of microroasted, local coffee and am curious what the optimal way to store it is (what temperature, humidity, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a cool, dark, dry, place and whenever possible vacuum sealed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oils in roasted coffee degrade as they are exposed to air (oxidization) as well as heat. As with just about any foodstuff moisture accelerates the spoiling process as well. You should store your coffee in completely sealed, insulated, opaque containers. If you have the ability, vacuum pump the air out of the container for ultimate shelf-stability. Even without vacuum storage you can preserve beans for a long time by placing them inside a ziplock bag or coffee bag with a 1-way air seal and pushing as much air out as possible and then following the above method of airtight, dark and cool storage. Following these guidelines should help to ensure the freshness and flavor of the beans for as long as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why is it not recommended to drink coffee immediately after it's roasted?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The rule of thumb is that you first drink coffee approximately 3 days after it is roasted, but what is the exact reason for this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Fresh off the roast, coffee has high levels of carbon dioxide and nitrogen (based?) gasses. These gasses will greatly contribute to &lt;em&gt;retro-nasal activity&lt;/em&gt; as well as initial flavors (think carbonated water). The most apparent flavor one gets from this is &lt;em&gt;metallic&lt;/em&gt;. At my work, 4 days is considered minimum for serving and tasting, although there's always exceptions. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How will "cold brewed" coffee differ from traditional hot-water extraction methods?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, what do "&lt;a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_brew"&gt;cold brewed&lt;/a&gt;" methods hope to achieve compared to the more traditional hot-water methods of extraction? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the amount of caffeine vary between hot brewed and cold brewed coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the other compounds such as Salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h1&gt;Cold Brew Coffee - A Brief look at Flavor Profiles&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My company builds flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry, using machine learning, data science, and analytical chemistry - let's use some of our 20,000+ coffee reviews to answer this question with &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been claimed for some time that cold brew as a method of extracting coffee only exists to minimize the amount of acidity in the flavor profile. This is only a third of the story, and may not be true for the coffee you brew or consume! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the full story? Read on! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Acidity in Cold Brewed vs Hot Brewed Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVwmT.png" alt="Sour &amp;amp; Acidity in Cold Vs Hot Brewed Coffee"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour &amp;amp; acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; acidic than its cold brewed counter part. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Differences in Average Flavor Profile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Immersion Cold Brew Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png" alt="Average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee"&gt;
This is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Immersion Hot Brew Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png" alt="Average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee"&gt;
This is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and 
acidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Differences in Flavor Profile by Brewing Method&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water. There are 2 primary types: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Reminder:&lt;/strong&gt; Coffee brewed with hot water, and then iced is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Cold Brew coffee.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full Immersion Cold Brew&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fresh &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CO2 Draft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nitrogen Draft &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottled &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ice Drip &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the 2 most interesting types of cold brews from the list above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stumptown Draft Cold Brew&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xyNjr.png" alt="Cold Brew Draft"&gt;
 This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with CO2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stumptown Nitro Cold Brew&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with nitrogen; the effect is a much smoother and fuller coffee, with a very thick and present mouth feel. 
&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PR6CJ.png" alt="Nitro Cold Brew"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cold brew coffee you make at home will be much closer to the average cold brew shown in the previous section, as I suspect few of the readers here will be making batches large enough to keg! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Update: Very Short Chemical Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do the concentration of compounds salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids differ between cold brew and hot brewed coffee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not so much concentration that matters - it's perception. For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why isn't coffee commonly sold in sachets, like tea bags?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering why single serving coffee &lt;a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sachet"&gt;sachets&lt;/a&gt; never really took off the way tea bags have. The only explanation I could find was that steeping coffee too long makes the coffee taste bad, but it seems like that could be avoided by removing the bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would the end result be terribly different than a french press, Turkish brew, or cowboy coffee? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, coffee is "commonly" sold in some kind of sachets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Japan, there is what is called "one-drip bag coffee". It consists of a flat sachet that you can unfold to deploy a small scaffold. The scaffold adapts to any mug-like cups. It unveils a filter containing ground coffee, as it unfolds. You just need to pour hot water in the filter to get a decent cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not link to any maker or brand, but most coffee dealers in Japan offer these bags---pretty convenient and offering a decent cup for the price. These bags seem somewhat popular in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure about global availability, though. Several countries do not sell them (e.g. Europe, perhaps because of the French / Italian influences).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the hexagon funnel shaped thing that came with my aeropress for?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When I bought my aeropress, it came with this weird hexagon thingy: &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q99VV.jpg" alt="hexagon thingy" title="aeropress funnel"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it for? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize the purpose of this hexagon shaped funnel, so I am sharing this via a self posted answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hexagon funnel has three purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a funnel to make it easier to pour your ground coffee into the aeropress opening. &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mrCWj.jpg" alt="funnel for putting ground coffee into aeropress"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a funnel for cups with a small opening at the top. The image shows a shot-glass as an example. Trying to use an aeropress with a cup that is too small sucks. &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UfXeI.jpg" alt="as a funnel for small cups"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a stand, so when your aeropress is stowed, it all neatly stacks together. &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/75JHQ.jpg" alt="stacked aeropress"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>What's the most effective way of generating crema from an Aeropress?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I know a number of people have become fairly capable at getting a nice amount of crema at the end of the process of making a cup with their Aeropress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, however, am getting just a very thin, partial layer at best. I've experimented with pressure, and somewhat with water temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wondering if there's a magic bullet, or a good list of bullet points of things to do to maximize crema?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick rundown of the Aeropress method I use every morning. I end up with a relatively crema-y shot. You'd never mistake it for one from an espresso machine, but there's a good layer all across the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is completely unscientific and I can't identify which steps here are the relevant ones for the good results, but maybe if you experiment with some of these adjustments you can identify what works and what doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aeropress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scoop that came with the Aeropress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00A1GVVMY" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Ultra fine mesh filter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beans I use vary; I generally grab a light or medium roast off the shelves at Trader Joes and grind it one click down from the finest setting on the in-store grinder. (The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00GK5R8IG" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/01/worst-and-best-coffee-at-trader-joes-which-coffee-to-buy-tj.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;it's the best bet&lt;/a&gt; for Trader Joe's coffee.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Water&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil. There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up the Aeropress for &lt;a href="http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;inverted brewing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a &lt;a href="http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;gooseneck kettle&lt;/a&gt; for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Edit:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My results vary significantly. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher. There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Edit Redux:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks I've been casually experimenting with my morning coffee and coming up with very inconclusive results. (As I &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress/165#comment772_165"&gt;mentioned below&lt;/a&gt;, all I've come up with are a bunch of totally surefire ways to absolutely demolish the crema, and no methods of preserving it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This half-butted casual science ends now! I just bought a hand grinder and &lt;a href="http://aeropresstimer.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;an app full of AeroPress recipes&lt;/a&gt;; thusly armed, I'm going to experiment more formally. Well, a little more formally.

&lt;h3&gt;Edit The Third:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0" rel="noreferrer"&gt;The results are in&lt;/a&gt;: I've figured out how to stop killing my crema. It turns out that the combination of &lt;strong&gt;freshly ground beans&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;the mesh metal filter&lt;/strong&gt; is somehow stopping the crema from getting through to the cup. Eight attempts with hand-ground beans failed miserably, and my first attempt after reverting to store-ground beans (with the 'somewhat loosey-goosey' method above) generated a nice layer of foam in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the plot thickens. My &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/users/137/robert-cartaino"&gt;colleague Robert&lt;/a&gt; asserts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never had a problem getting crema with aeropress. Lots of fresh coffee ground to a powder, very little very hot water. Makes my ubercoffee syrup shots I talked about a year or more ago... with plenty o crema. Dilute to taste (which I never did &amp;lt; jitter &amp;gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and I'm not entirely sure, but if memory serves, switching to the fine metal mesh filter meant bye-bye to crema. It's been a bit too long to remember for certain. I just reused the same paper filter over and over for months (actually, I used two to keep them from blowing out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it would seem that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freshly, very finely ground coffee + paper filter + not much water = crema city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee ground fine in the store + metal filter + water = crema town&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd be interested to see others' results from experiments like these.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>When does coffee go off?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;If I've ground a batch of coffee, I know I should use it as soon as possible, but if I store it (in an opaque, air-tight, slightly-below-room-temp container), how long have I got to use it? Are there any key points at which the quality will degrade (e.g. after a day, after a week)?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h1&gt;Whole Bean Coffee Degradation Over Time&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whole bean coffee will go stale within 14 days - on average. The graph below shows the quick 1.5 standard deviation drop in quality within the first 14 days (marked in red). &lt;sub&gt;*See note below for details&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Zu5y.png" alt="Degradation of Perceived Quality Over Time"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staling in the context of coffee has a commonly agreed on definition - the loss of volatile aromatic compounds and the oxidation of surface oils on the roasted coffee beans. The loss of aromatics affects the flavor profile because: 1) they are both part of the same degradation process and 2) the majority of what you taste in coffee is flavors from volatile aromatics through retronasal olfactory sensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph was created using data from &lt;a href="https://gastrograph.com/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Analytical Flavor Systems&lt;/a&gt; where we build quality control and flavor profiling tools for craft beverage producers. &lt;em&gt;Perceived Quality&lt;/em&gt; is a non-hedonic assessment of a product's quality. This time series is taken from a degradation study.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground coffee, on the other hand, will stale within minutes. 70 cc of ambient air is enough to render one pound of coffee stale. On average, this process takes seven minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the degradation curve looks about the same! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Data Analysis Minutia (notes)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time series model was segmented using daily &lt;em&gt;Perceived Quality&lt;/em&gt; means from a random selection of 15,000 coffee reviews. All coffees included are whole bean, freshly ground, third wave coffee brewed in a Chemex with a bleached filter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain other brewing methods, particularly methods optimized for older coffee such a Nel, may show a different degradation curve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;staling point&lt;/em&gt; was selected by a parametric statistical change point analysis, which searches for shifts in the mean and variance of a time series. This time series was modeled for change point analysis using a Poisson distribution as  we're searching for the average number of coffees that go stale within a specific time-point, and the model was set to find &lt;em&gt;at most one change&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does the hardness of water matter when making coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I live in a hard water area and when brewing English Tea I can &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; taste and see the difference when compared to where I'm from, which is a soft water area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the hardness of the water matter when making coffee, too?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, whether or not the taste is more or less intense depending on the hardness of the water. I haven't noticed but I would think it does affect the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd be interested in a &lt;strong&gt;scientific/objective view&lt;/strong&gt;. As of now, I use bottled water in my kettle.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is to say it will definitely affect flavor, but how it affects the flavor is ultimately dependent upon the specific mineral compounds found in your hard water vs. other hard waters and soft water's lack of these compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the key: Some of the compounds in hard water are &amp;quot;sticky,&amp;quot; glomming onto certain compounds in coffee when they meet (in your coffeemaker). The more eugenol the water hangs on to, for example, the woodsier the taste of your coffee will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is particularly sticky, meaning water that's high in magnesium will make coffee with a stronger flavor (and higher levels of caffeine). Hard water can also have high levels of bicarbonate, though, which Hendon found could lead to more bitter flavors coming through.  - A Chemist Has Uncovered A Secret To Brewing Delicious Coffee At Home &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/a-chemist-has-uncovered-a-secret-to-delicious-coffee-2014-6#ixzz3Q3ecJSgz" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So depending on flavor preferences you might prefer your hard water at home but dislike it at work or simply prefer soft water altogether. Traditionally hard water is actually sought after for other beverage processes like beer brewing because of some of the abilities described above.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I minimize the amount of grounds at the bottom of my French press coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I brew coffee with a French press, I tend to get a significant amount of grind left near the bottom of the cup, making the last bit of coffee far less enjoyable - mostly regardless, it seems, of how finely I grind the beans. Is there any method or tool I can use to minimize the amount of grind left at the bottom of the cup?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have the same problem, and these things definitely reduce it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grind more coarsely. Blade grinders are incapable of really doing this—they give you boulders and powder. But I've never been satisfied with the taste when I use coarse grounds— it's weak and lacks body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the screen fits well and no grounds are squirting along the sides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press gently, don't force it down with a lot of pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After pressing, wait a minute before decanting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't drink the dregs remaining at the bottom of the cup... unless you're like a friend of mine who relishes them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if none of that works for you, try a different brew method. Paper filters are very good at keeping grounds out of your cup.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>What is the process to reduce bitterness in coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've heard of adding salt to coffee to reduce its bitterness.
I've also heard that using freshly roasted and ground coffee would reduce the bitterness experienced when drinking coffee. Though it seems making freshly roasted coffee could actually make things worse, according to &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/6/why-is-it-not-recommended-to-drink-coffee-immediately-after-its-roasted"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a documented process (not additive) to reduce the bitterness of coffee and any research in why that's the case?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of factors that contribute to the bitterness of coffee. Some of these have to do with the concentration of various compounds in the coffee and the roasting process, but the way you brew the coffee can make a big difference as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that you are not going to be harvesting and roasting your own coffee, we can focus on the brewing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying Beans:&lt;/strong&gt; Robusta vs Arabica&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To decrease perceived bitterness in coffee, the best choice is Arabica. Arabica beans are often sweeter with notes of sugars and fruits and a somewhat wine-like acidity. Robusta on the other hand tends to be harsher with more bitterness. This difference in quality is reflected in cost however, as Arabica tends to be more expensive than Robusta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of roast level, medium roasts generally contain fewer soluble solids, more acidity and a stronger aroma than dark roasts. All of these should contribute to making medium roasts on average less bitter than dark roasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water&lt;/strong&gt;: Temperature and Chemistry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to find the sweet spot when it comes to temperature, a little trial and error can be used here depending on the blend and brewing method. For example, the people at AeroPress recommend a much lower temperature to reduce bitterness that what you would use in a french press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general research has shown that coffee brewed in hot water is perceived to be less bitter than when cold water is used. Additionally, bitterness is reduced when hard or soft water is used when compared to distilled water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brewing [Extraction]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitterness is strongly correlated with the amount of dissolved solids in the brewed coffee. To ensure that the amount of dissolved solids and the overall extraction is correct (and minimally bitter), make sure to use the correct grind coarseness, water temperature, and brew time for your chosen method. Over extraction can be a major cause of bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drip and pour-over brewing methods tend to have less bitterness than a french press or other immersion methods. This can be attributed to less dissolved solids in the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCIENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this section will be outside the control of most, but it is interesting nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research has found that the introduction of polyphenols reduces the bitterness of coffee. The metallic bitterness found in some coffee has been attributed to  dicaffeoylquinic acids. Trigonelline is perceived as bitter at concentrations of 0.25% and its degredation is proportional to roast level. Roasting Trigonelline produces a byproduct called pyridines and helps create the roasty aroma found in some coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chlorogenic acid is also found in coffee, higher concentrations in Robusta than Arabica, and that contributes to the bitterness as well. Additionally, Quinic acid is a product formed from the degradation of Chlorogenic acid and is present in coffee at twenty times its taste threshold, contributing to the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furfuryl alcohol is also known to increase the bitterness of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Are robusta and arabica the only bean varieties?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;On this site, and virtually everywhere, I hear people speaking about coffee in terms of "arabica" or "robusta". I know these are two coffee varieties, but are there others as well? Why aren't those as popular? Where can they be found?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;several varieties&lt;/strong&gt; of coffee that have all derived from the three species of Coffea genus of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubiaceae" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Rubiaceae family&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Coffee Arabica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Coffee Canephora&lt;/a&gt; (Robusta)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_liberica" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Coffee Liberica&lt;/a&gt; (Liberian)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VV5Hp.jpg" alt="Coffee Varieties Graph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from this &lt;a href="https://counterculturecoffee.com/learn/varieties" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Counter Culture graph&lt;/a&gt;, each variety has a unique lineage, likely designed to grow well in a specific climate and geographical region while producing a unique profile once brewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee can be treated much like Wine: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terroir" rel="noreferrer"&gt;terroir&lt;/a&gt; and variety is key to growth, but then roasting and brewing is also extremely important for the final cup. Several artisanal single-origin roasts will feature tasting notes, variety, and growing region to accommodate your shopping experience when reviewing what is in season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Bourbon variety grown in the volcanic region of El Salvador will brew a completely different experience compared to the highly-prized Gesha variety grown in Columbia, even though they can both be traced back to the Arabica species.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is Kopi Luwak safe to drink?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Kopi luwak, i.e. Vietnamese weasel coffee, is made from beans that have been consumed and excreted by civets.  It can cost as much as $3000/lb, so few have probably tried it. This process doesn't seem incredibly sanitary.   Is this coffee safe to drink?  Do people contract diseases from drinking it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's perfectly safe to drink and &lt;em&gt;extremely delicious&lt;/em&gt;. In The Philippines, we often call this 'Kopi &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_palm_civet"&gt;Alamid&lt;/a&gt;', and it truly is one of the rarest coffees on the planet. At around $20 per 75 grams (local price), it's also one of the world's most expensive coffees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The palm civet is a nocturnal cat (well, more like a ferret, but technically a cat) that eats the berries (beans) and is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; picky in its diet. For the civet to choose a bean, it has to be &lt;em&gt;just right&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to the aroma, and given the sensitivity of this creature's nose, said aroma means the bean is perfect. Some say the digestive process itself lends to better flavor, it can be a matter of heated debate depending on where you ask ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, the cat doesn't digest the whole bean, just the outer pulp. Farmers follow them around and wait for nature to take its course, then the beans are processed in a very safe manner. Farmers typically get just a kilo or so a day, it's quite an intensive process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drink it as often as I can afford to do so, and I have never gotten sick. It's a partly fruity, partly nutty and just an all over &lt;em&gt;cozy&lt;/em&gt; and relaxing taste that I highly recommend if you're able to get the coffee. Just be prepared to pay quite a bit, and ready to consume it quickly after getting it home (it does not keep as well as others, probably due to local transportation issues prolonging the time it takes from roasting to actually get to market).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a hand-powered burr grinder, I recommend using it and grinding pretty gingerly, even the heat of most ceramic grinders is enough to lose a little bit of the fruity taste you'd otherwise get. Really, treat these beans like royalty, they're that good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you buy some, try to avoid buying from farms with captive civets - the growing popularity of this coffee has led to a cottage trapping industry, which is (unfortunately) likely to seriously endanger them soon.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Chemically, what's happening to coffee after it's brewed?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So I've prepared my coffee in the morning, and transferred it to a thermos flask, where it will only cool down negligibly over the course of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is anything happening to the coffee in the flask? Will the taste of the coffee change over the course of the day, or will a cup poured at 5pm taste essentially the same as one poured first thing in the morning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had a perfect flask that lost no heat, how long would my coffee stay tasting as fresh as possible?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The biggest chemical change that is going to occur is going to be &lt;strong&gt;oxidation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Oxidation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chemically, oxidation is defined as the following from &lt;a href="http://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/81" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this source.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons
  are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different
  compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically related to coffee, oxidation is further elaborated upon as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates
  two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived)
  compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oxidation of coffee occurs when oxygen molecules (present in the air in your flask and also dissolved in the water used to brew the coffee) come into contact with different compounds in the coffee. Even if you had no air whatsoever in the flask, this process would still happen due to the dissolved oxygen in the water used to make the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of oxidation occurs much more readily at higher heats, hence the reason why cold brewed coffee does not go stale as quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the oxygen combines with the hydrogen, water is created. That hydrogen ion, when it was free, was adding to the acidity of the coffee. Once it is no longer free and connected to the oxygen, in the form of water, the pH of the coffee will rise slightly, making the coffee more bitter. This is can be perceived as 'staleness'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compounds which are oxidized are the acids, aromatics, and oils.  All of these give your coffee it's great taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Loss of heat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the coffee cools, the molecules will vibrate more slowly. This leads to a drop in temperature and will occur in any container, no matter how good it is. Since you have described a situation with minimal heat loss, this process is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oxidation causes the coffee to become stale. This is a bean roasters worst nightmare. For the brewed coffee, it dismantles aromatics, acids, and oils - all key contributors to the coffee's flavor. It also raises the pH to make it more bitter and adds water to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So no, it won't taste the same at 5 pm as it would poured first thing in the morning. The taste of the coffee will change over the course of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering your final question about duration of freshness:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long will your coffee stay fresh in a perfect flask? That is a matter of opinion. Every coffee shop has a different standard for how long they let their brewed coffee sit. It can be 15 minutes to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as you roast a bean, it begins to stale. As soon as you grind coffee, it begins to stale. As soon as you brew coffee, it begins to stale. It's hard to qualify what you will consider to be 'fresh'. A purist will tell you that unless you consume the coffee immediately, your coffee will be stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, it is a matter of opinion, and if you have the perfect flask, I would say you could wait about an hour before your coffee becomes stale. That's just me though. &lt;strong&gt;The sooner you drink it the better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure there is little to no air left in your flask.&lt;/strong&gt; You might also look into cold brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

  <title>What is the science (if any) behind bulletproof coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years I've been slowly starting to dabble in the caffeinated arts.  I'm far from being knowledgeable, but I'm definitely very curious about this favourite beverage of mine.  So, I occasionally read up on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long ago I discovered something called &lt;strong&gt;Bulletproof Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;.  It seems to be associated with the Paleo diet movement.  It involves adding butter to your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked around at a few coffee shops but nobody seems to know why anyone would do this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articles such as &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/nov/25/bulletproof-coffee-is-adding-butter-to-your-morning-coffee-a-step-too-far"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; one claim it gives an energy boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this true?  If so, what is the science behind this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Another view on this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bulletproof coffee is often used with a low-carb diet, often referred to as the "keto diet", which has some similarities with Paleo, but is quite different. The diet requires you to cut out as many carbohydrates as possible out of your diet in order to get your body into a state of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis" rel="nofollow"&gt;ketosis&lt;/a&gt;, where most of the energy in the body is produced by processing fat instead of carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When following the keto diet, you need to eat a lot of fat, minimum carbohydrates and a reasonable amount of protein. The goal is to get most of your calories from fat. Getting in all the fat that is required is often difficult, so in that context, bulletproof coffee is nothing more than a delivery method for fat. There's nothing special about it, it's just easier to drink a spoonful of butter melted in coffee than eating it on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to read up on keto further, the keto reddit has lots of resources on it: &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/keto" rel="nofollow"&gt;Keto In A Nutshell.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Did people actually drink coffee off the saucer?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.ilovecoffee.jp/posts/view/83"&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt; has a claim that seems somewhat ludicrous nowadays. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"[People] used to pour coffee into the saucer to cool it off, and slurped it off the saucer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems laughably silly by modern standards - enough so to make me question its veracity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did people actually do this in the 18th century? If so, why? We drink coffee out of cups now - what changed?&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In fact, it seems that people would drink both from the cup &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; from the saucer: After being served a hot beverage (e.g., coffee or tea) in a cup on top of a saucer, some would pour a small amount of the beverage onto the saucer, and then drink from the saucer. There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! Though I've never seen this practice in person, the following is what I have aggregated from a bit of online searching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://organon.jimhufford.com/2010/03/things-ive-always-wondered-about-cooling-saucer-edition/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; contains some good links about the topic. I find the most compelling of them to be an article that discusses &lt;a href="http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/classroom/curriculum_12th/unit3/lesson8/bkgdessay.html"&gt;the use of &lt;em&gt;deep&lt;/em&gt; saucers&lt;/a&gt; for this practice; the saucer is larger and deeper like a shallow bowl, alleviating some of the awkward logistical aspects of drinking from a flat or shallow saucer. Another anecdote, &lt;a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/common/briefing/Senate_legislative_process.htm"&gt;according to US government legend&lt;/a&gt;, George Washington (in a discussion with Thomas Jefferson) used the literal practice (cooling-off beverages in a saucer) as a metaphor for the cooling-off that occurs in the upper house of a bicameral legislature. Even if this exact exchange is embellished, it still suggests that the practice was common enough to be in the vernacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, pouring part of a hot beverage into a saucer would help cool it down faster. Many anecdotal sources have that as an assumed motivation; if you're in a hurry to start drinking your beverage (and are a bit careful about the pouring and the saucer-sipping) it's a practical way of doing so. Some other anecdotes suggest that it was fashionable or polite (maybe even fun?) -- perhaps like &lt;a href="http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/behaviourfood.html"&gt;eating peas off the back of one's fork&lt;/a&gt;. Cooling a portion in the saucer would alleviate the need for potentially-impolite-seeming slurping or blowing across the beverage to cool it, substituting instead acrobatic-prowess-demonstrating yet possibly-more-polite sipping off of a saucer.  Other discussion forums (&lt;a href="http://aforum.genealogi.se/discus/messages/2450/91396.html?1269309231"&gt;one example&lt;/a&gt;) contain some additional anecdotes and pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>I run my espresso machine until my whole cup is full. What's my coffee called?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a cheap espresso machine. I grind dark roast beans separately, fill a "double" filter with it, run the espresso machine and won't turn it off until my ~250ml cup is completely filled. I drink it right away, brewed coffee style, without adding anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not Americano (it's got crema all over it), too much water to be espresso, and to my understanding, Long Black is espresso added to water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this simply, regular brewed coffee with crema?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'd say that it's a caffè crema which is generally made the way you make your coffee and is about 240 ml. It's about 3 times more water than a &lt;em&gt;normale&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to avoid soya milk curdling in coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I like to make a coffee with soya milk. Sometimes when I add the milk to the coffee it curdles, i.e. it separates into lumps floating in translucent liquid. This tastes and looks a bit strange (but is still drinkable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I prevent soya milk from curdling? Does it depend on the type of coffee, or the type of soya milk? Or does it have something to do with how and when they are mixed together?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It seems that &lt;em&gt;the cause&lt;/em&gt; of the situation of curdling soya milk in coffee is that the acid from the coffee curdles the proteins and/or fats in the (soya or other) milk, being catalysed by the heat of the coffee; so that's what needs to be mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple related questions on &lt;a href="http://cooking.stackexchange.com"&gt;Cooking.SE&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/30060/25286"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; that suggests &lt;strong&gt;adding salt to the coffee will help a little&lt;/strong&gt; (table salt, or even bicarb / baking soda).
I have tried adding table salt to the coffee first, then adding the coffee to the soya milk, and it seems to help (a little, sometimes; YMMV). &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/28179/25286"&gt;Another Cooking.SE question&lt;/a&gt; also suggests waiting for coffee to cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The linked TheKitchn article (linked from the aforementioned previous question and @PythonMaster's answer) suggests that cooling the coffee, or pouring coffee &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; the soya milk (rather than the other way around) helps via similar mechanisms. In my experience in messing around with this, &lt;strong&gt;I have not found the order of adding ingredients makes much difference&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., putting coffee into the soya milk). &lt;strong&gt;It absolutely depends on the type of coffee&lt;/strong&gt;, also, because &lt;a href="http://www.highergroundstrading.com/blog/38/coffee-acidity:-the-science-and-the-experience--" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;different coffees will have different degrees of acidity&lt;/a&gt;.  See also &lt;a href="http://www.highlandcoffeesbr.com/coffeeprofileschart.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this table&lt;/a&gt; about relative acidity levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is certainly the case that &lt;strong&gt;adding coffee into the milk will be helpful in general&lt;/strong&gt; (compare also to &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/4208/25286"&gt;tempering of eggs&lt;/a&gt; or adding acid &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; water rather than the other way around).  In this order, these allow temperature and acid (respectively) to more slowly come into balance between the two substances as they are being combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMHO, I have found &lt;em&gt;the brand&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., the ingredients and production methods) of the soya milk to be the biggest factor. I (personally, with not-entirely-scientific -- yet! -- trials) find that &lt;strong&gt;soya milk brands that contain emulsifiers (or other additives) are less likely to curdle in coffee&lt;/strong&gt;.  My only guesses are that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these compounds (emulsifiers, thickeners, or stabilisers, such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;carrageenan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthan_gum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;xanthan gum&lt;/a&gt;) interfere with the coagulation, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;something else in the processing (perhaps, e.g., pasteurisation) has denatured the proteins or otherwise chemically changed the nutrients such that they are less likely (cf., UHT or ultra-pasteurised milk)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generally prefer to avoid the additives, so this is an unfortunate conclusion for me personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freshness of the milk is also an issue; milk of all types will spoil and slowly start to curdle due to natural processes (fermentation, bacteria, other contamination). There's another question &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/45476/25286"&gt;about storing soya milk in the freezer&lt;/a&gt;, where we reached similar conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of making this an even longer answer, here are some other things to try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;em&gt;cold coffee&lt;/em&gt; into soya milk.  Does it curdle?  If so, it seems temperature is not your only enemy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check your label; does it have carrageenan or so?  If so, this might not be the metaphorical silver bullet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm interested (fascinated, even; obsessed, maybe?:) ) with this, so I'd really like to hear feedback. Of the dozens of articles I've read on this, I've still not found a proper solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy experimenting; comments welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do brown and white paper filters compare?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Besides the obvious &lt;em&gt;colour&lt;/em&gt; difference: &lt;strong&gt;Is there any significant difference between using a brown ("natural") paper filter, and a white (bleached or otherwise whitened) paper filter?&lt;/strong&gt; That is: when all other factors are held constant; when used for drip, filter, pour-over, etc. brewing methods when using a paper filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The metrics that I can think of include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filtering &lt;strong&gt;performance&lt;/strong&gt;. E.g., Do brown and white filters filter out the same "stuff"? Do they permit the same rate of water flow? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavor of result.&lt;/strong&gt; E.g., Does one or the other impart off-flavours (e.g., leftovers from whitening, or &lt;em&gt;lack of whitening&lt;/em&gt;)? Does does the resulting brewed coffee taste the same?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Production / environmental issues.&lt;/strong&gt; E.g., Does it take more energy to produce one or the other? Waste? Chemicals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried to read up on this, and most sources seem to indicate that there's no significant difference; it reduces to personal preference, or off-hand environmental claims... but I see nothing concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melitta says that &lt;a href="http://www.melitta.com/en/Why-We-Filter-1662.html"&gt;they don't use chlorine bleach to whiten paper filters&lt;/a&gt; instead using "oxygen" (which I take to actaully mean "peroxide", which may be less bad, but I'm not sure). Clicking through also says there's no difference, so maybe I should just accept that;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/869247"&gt;A discussion on Chow&lt;/a&gt; has little more than personal preference;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basically the same on &lt;a href="http://coffeegeek.com/forums/coffee/general/522410"&gt;CoffeeGeek&lt;/a&gt; with a "paper taste" claim about brown filters;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar mild paper-taste conclusion from &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/sm2n9/chemex_my_unbleached_vs_bleached_filter_experiment/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are many difference between the two filters. In this &lt;a href="https://www.baltcoffee.com/content/whats-difference-between-brown-filters-and-white-filters"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. it states that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, most white paper filters are whitened with oxygen. Oxygen whitening is much more friendly to the environment, and imparts no taste to the filter. Brown filters are simply unwhitened. Your choice, but oxygen whitened filters are usually less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brown filters are just plain without any improvements. Surprisingly, they are more expensive yet yields the same flavor as a white filter here. Trying to save money, get a white one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Speaking of Performance...&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href="http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-filters-information.htm"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;,it states that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Natural brown : In its natural form, all paper is brown colored, so brown filters are completely unprocessed. Other than aesthetics and processing, there are no other differences in color.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;White : White paper filters are processed to get that clean, white shade. Chlorine bleaching or natural oxygen bleaching are common methods for whitening paper. Generally, better quality paper ones do not use chlorine bleach.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid white coffee filters that have been whitened with cholrine bleaching. These types of filters have a lower quality than natural brown or white ones using natural oxygen methods. Performance may vary though. Look online like in Amazon for high quality paper filters and look at the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Taste&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, some brown paper filters will add some extra taste to your coffee, sometimes not that good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Melitta 'whites' are best. I use them, as they are oxygenated, not bleached. I don't care for any of the brown filters. I have used the Filtropa/Aroma (browns) and the Chemex and didn't care for them. Many brown filters introduce a wet cardboard taste into the brew. Hario is an exception but they are pricey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brown paper filters add a wet cardboard taste to your coffee. That just makes your coffee less enjoyable. As said in the performance section, white filters are probably better (if only implied with natural oxygen methods to get the white). Hario is a brown paper filter that acts like a white paper filter, adding no extra, disgusting flavor into your coffee. It is rather expensive though. Here is the &lt;a href="http://www.sweetmariascoffee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;amp;t=833"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; where all the information of this section came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Environmental Impacts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well here is a paragraph about a study by Harvard about paper filters and such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to Harvard Health Publications, paper filters are more effective at eliminating diterpenes than permanent or cloth filters. Paper filters are also easier to clean up -- you dispose of them after one use. Cloth and permanent filters must be cleaned after every use. Paper filters are not as environmentally friendly as the other types of filters, but since they’re made of natural fibers, they are biodegradable. To make paper filters more “green,” compost them along with your coffee grounds. For composting, natural brown filters are better than bleached white filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper filters aren't as eco-friendly as others but can are biodegradeable, unlike plastic which takes forever and metal, which probably takes even longer. Paper filters can even be used as compost with your coffee grounds. It will make good fertilizer with the rest of your compost. Using normal brown paper filters is preferred over bleached white filters. Production is nearly the same. A white paper filter is really a brown paper filter that is bleached or has added oxygen. Here is the &lt;a href="http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/benefits-using-coffee-filters-7625.html"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that provided the paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a lot of differences that are outright clear, but there are minor differences between the two. I hope this helps you!&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Should I rinse paper coffee filters before use?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have never bothered to rinse my paper coffee filters before use, but some strongly recommend this. I did some experiments, outlined below, to test this. &lt;strong&gt;I don't find rinsing makes any difference,&lt;/strong&gt; but there might be benefit that I don't understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My questions,&lt;/strong&gt; in sum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the best way to rinse a paper filter?&lt;/strong&gt; Inside, outside, both? Soak? Hot or cold water?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it help?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonus: &lt;strong&gt;What is being rinsed off?&lt;/strong&gt; Are loose bits of paper really coming off the filter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the many articles about this, most of them simply point to &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/10/coffee-filters-you-should-clean-them-coffee-technique.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this Serious Eats article&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5855965/rinse-your-coffee-filters-for-a-cleaner-better-tasting-cup-of-coffee" rel="noreferrer"&gt;lifehacker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/is-rinsing-your-159436" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the kitchn&lt;/a&gt; don't have much more content; others are chat/discussions without concrete conclusions or references). That article says &lt;em&gt;rinsing removes "dusty stuff"&lt;/em&gt; from the filter (that suggests that there's off-tastes from the paper dust), and rinsing also &lt;em&gt;helps reduce clogging&lt;/em&gt; of filter pores (presumably also from the "dusty stuff"). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of the paper filter certainly matters; comments and responses to &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; support that. I buy the cheapest brown filters available, so I think it's unlikely that my filters "don't need rinsing" or so, but perhaps they're so cheap as to "not benefit from rinsing." &lt;a href="http://landofathousandhills.com/fromtheroastmaster/why-you-should-rinse-your-paper-filter-before-brewing/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; suggests some filter taste-tests, so I did them and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My experiments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I poured water through rinsed and non-rinsed filters and tasted the water that went through the filter. Both taste faintly of paper, but I see no difference;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have brewed simultaneous batches with rinsed and non-rinsed; I taste exactly no difference;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have even gone so far as to chew on rinsed and non-rinsed paper filters to see if I could tell a difference. (&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; to be clear, I chewed on these filters only to see if I taste a difference between rinsed and non-rinsed paper filters, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to somehow "condition" the filter before brewing use)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper filters taste terrible&lt;/strong&gt; -- mine anyway -- rinsed or not. I may have to revisit &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare"&gt;this question on brown versus white filters&lt;/a&gt;, buy better paper filters, or use a &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/434/how-does-nel-drip-compare-to-paper-filtered-pour-over"&gt;cloth-filtered Nel pot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wasted a lot of filters doing these tests&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, after using a pre-rinsed filter I got a "structural failure" -- the bottom of the filter broke -- when brewing pour-over with a heavily rinsed filter. I'll probably have to eat some better-quality or white paper filters to make this fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, my only conclusion is that &lt;strong&gt;quickly rinsing the inside &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; outside&lt;/strong&gt; of the filter is the only way for this to have any benefit. I'm discounting any other benefit of pre-rinsing, such as rinsing with hot water would warm ceramic cone filter-holder or pot/mug.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Do you have maker with a removable filter basket? (Like the photo I attached below.) If so, then you might try what I've done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;removing the basket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;placing the filter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then running water through it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nQFsH.jpg" alt="removable mesh filter basket"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support of the basket protects against failures. And while you won't be able to rinse the reverse side easily, you will be able to get enough water into it to saturate through the paper. (Those flakes you mention will be trapped between the reverse of the filter and the basket.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot versus Cold? I'd use warm. Some things you're removing may be more soluble at higher temperatures. I wouldn't go to the trouble of heating pre-filtered water. there is something to be said for water temperature affecting the filtering qualities of the paper by expanding the fibers, and in turn spaces between fibers. But without testing we'll have to assume it's a minor. If you only have cold filtered water, I suggest you use that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not hot water? First, a quick rinse of hot water isn't going to neutralize significantly more micro organisms that cold. You need boiling or much higher for a length of time to do that. Second, hot water will make the filter more prone to breaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have brewed simultaneous batches with rinsed and non-rinsed; I taste exactly no difference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads me to think that soaking is worth a try. If it works for rice to remove excess starch, it might work similarly with paper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly different angle on this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to find the filters that don't need rinsing. When I filter I'm doing so to reduce the cholesterol raising impact of coffee. I prefer the taste of unfiltered coffee, but the evidence convinces me that filtered coffee is better for my cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study linked below, amongst others, shows that paper filters remove much of the cholesterol-raising compounds, as much as "80% of the lipid-solublue substance that was present..." Pre-wetting the paper --pre-loading the fibers with water, really-- seem as though it would reduce this absorbent property, although I can't back that up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2796.1991.tb00447.x/abstract;jsessionid=0FFD783EB31A0500EEE23CED22FF8C2E.f04t02?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;amp;userIsAuthenticated=false" rel="noreferrer" title="The hypercholesterolaemic factor in boiled coffee is retained by a paper filter - Journal of Internal Medicine"&gt;The hypercholesterolaemic factor in boiled coffee is retained by a paper filter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What roast level is recommended for cold brew?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;With due credit to @Roland for &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1557/262"&gt;his questions&lt;/a&gt;, I peeled off a related topic into a new question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With any preparation, roast level is a bit of personal preference. However, certain roasts are more common or &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; taste better with certain preparations (cf., "espresso roast" or so).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about for cold brew? Aside from personal preference, &lt;strong&gt;is there something about cold brew that lends itself to better extraction with a certain roast level?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;strong&gt;a medium roast is recommended&lt;/strong&gt; in both &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/cold-brew" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the cold-brew guide from Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/how-make-cold-brew-coffee" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the guide from Kicking Horse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in the Kicking Horse link above, cold brew will generally produce a lower-acid result (i.e., than the same coffee prepared by other methods). Generally speaking, lighter roasts will have &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; acid content. The combination of these two seems to suggest (to me, anyway) to the conclusion that one can use lighter roasts for cold brew (i.e., lighter than you might otherwise enjoy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a good reason to use medium (or lighter roasts) with cold-brew?&lt;/strong&gt; Or, alternatively: &lt;strong&gt;Is there some reason to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use dark roasts with cold-brew?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm going to answer this in terms of flavor, and then acidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, people choose more lightly roasted coffee to preserve the terroir flavors of the bean. These flavors usually come from unstable molecules that deteriorate quickly after the coffee is brewed. When coffee is brewed and consumed relatively quickly, the drinker can enjoy those flavors. Cold brew produces a more muddled mixture of flavors and relies more on mouthfeel and big flavors like sweetness, savory, earth, chocolate, etc. More delicate precise flavors are lost. It is also important to note that some fruit, vegetal, and herbal flavors are enhanced by the presence of acid, like adding lemon juice and tarragon to a fish filet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you are trying to avoid acid but you love the fruitiness of say, a medium roasted Kenyan single origin, you could cold brew it and see if you still get the flavors you want. If you hear about another light roasted coffee that has strong sweetness but is more acidic than you usually like, try it as a cold brew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.e. if acid is what is holding you back with specific coffees you want to try, try them as a cold brew.&lt;/strong&gt; Just know that the lack of acid in the cold brew may make it a little lack-luster compared to a traditional cup, especially since tasting notes are made when evaluating hot brewed cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darker roasted coffee as already lost more of the bean flavors and gained more roast flavors. If anything, I would say that a darker roast is going to have a more consistent flavor between hot and cold brewing simply because more of the delicate flavors have already been burned away. I would bet that Kicking Horse and Blue Bottle suggest a medium roast for cold brew because a medium roast preserves the beans own characteristics while introducing the roast flavors. This is why single origins are usually roasted to full city or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary, I would suggest that you find a coffee you like already as a French press or pour over and cold brew that regardless of roast.&lt;/strong&gt; Lighter roasts may lose some of their complexity in a cold brew, darker roasts will mellow even more in a cold brew. As backwards as it is, I hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Brewing with the same coffee grounds twice?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My new job has me buying my own coffee for the first time in my professional career.  I'm amazed at the amount of coffee I consume.  I brew at my desk using an aeropress.  Has anyone tried to use the grounds more than once?  Any tips as I try it out?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In general, I argue that &lt;strong&gt;you &lt;em&gt;shouldn't be able to&lt;/em&gt; re-use the grounds.&lt;/strong&gt; That is, for any brewing session, your goal is to extract exactly what you want from the beans. If you do this optimally for your method and taste, there's nothing left in the beans that you want; re-extracting will give you a different result. The second brew might be drinkable and even tasty, but it will have a disproportionately small amount of stuff you might want, like caffeine and other flavour compounds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, @Madmanta's answer makes a good point: it might work in some cases, such as Aeropress or espresso. But this suggests &lt;strong&gt;you might want to change other parameters of your brewing&lt;/strong&gt;. If you can re-brew your coffee with a result that you like, you might be able to, for example, use less grounds. This saves money, which sounds like it's part of your goal. Alternatively, you could brew a larger cup of coffee with the same amount of beans, or increase the extraction time. In the case of AeroPress, for example, I find that many of the recipes are decidedly under-extracted, so this might be an explanation for why a second brew works for you; see &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1564/what-do-the-terms-extraction-and-strength-mean"&gt;this Q/A for what I mean by extraction&lt;/a&gt; in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could &lt;strong&gt;try this experimentally&lt;/strong&gt; also: brew a cup of Aeropress or pour-over as you usually do, then brew another batch in the same way. For example, I find the last few drops of pour-over brew to be watery and off-tasting but the entire batch tastes better together than either of the two parts separately. If you like it, go for it. Or use half the amount of grounds the next time. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a practical note, you might also consider simply to &lt;strong&gt;brew a larger batch of coffee all in one go&lt;/strong&gt;. You'll get a slightly different product but, for example, I find that I use way less grounds for a 10-cup thermal carafe than for 10 individual cups.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to grow coffee at home?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am a heavy coffee user and I want to know what's in my coffee and therefore I'd like to grow coffee in my home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to grow coffee in an apartment?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It is possible to grow coffee indoors. If allowed to grow as a tree they can reach 8 feet tall but if trimmed occasionally you can get the plant to grow more like a bush around 3-4 feet. This will change some based on the exact type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee plants prefer shade with a couple hours of direct sunlight in the morning. Keeping it by a window should be about right. Depending on your climate you want to be careful taking it outside during winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As J Musser mentioned, this will be a long process that will yield very little, but it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, coffee plants are evergreens and look very nice as indoor plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more &lt;a href="http://www.thanksgivingcoffee.com/blog/?p=174" rel="noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Stealing @JMussers comments to add to my answer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One large apartment plant will only produce enough coffee for a few cups worth each year, and that's after years of growth. They do look good, though. My point was, indoor coffee plants aren't that effective. Outdoors, a good plant will produce around 2-3 lbs. of grean beans per year. They are usually planted about 8'x8' apart, or a near equivalent, so 680 plants per acre, = around 1700 lbs of green coffee per acre per year, under good conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is coffee bloom</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I make drip coffee (pour over for North Americans) at home and I would like to know: what exactly is coffee bloom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I pour the initial amount of water the grounds swell up, and sometimes there is a minor eruption if I'm not careful, but is this just air trapped in the grounds and water solution trying to escape or is this CO2?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this affect flavour? What affects the volume of the bloom?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The gases themselves are largely composed of CO2 and moisture trapped in the grinds. My understanding is that releasing the gases ahead of time prevent the gasses from interfering with an even extraction throughout the brewing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As when brewing coffee, we're trying to expose the grounds evenly to the hot water, the release of gas fights against this, causing channeling or uneven extraction. This can affect your flavor profile by overextracting some of the coffee, and not extracting enough from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my own experience, fresher, better-quality coffees tend to produce more gasses. I would imagine this being because the gasses escape on their own over time from the coffee when it's just sitting around.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>What is the background of brewing coffee with eggs?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I hope the question isn't too broad or fuzzy. But quite a while ago, I stumbled across coffee that was prepared with eggs. The basic recipe involved mixing ground coffee with raw eggs (I think even &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; their shells), then cooking that mix with water and filtering it afterwards. The end result of that was in consistence and taste not much different from classic (drip, so to say) coffee, but had a notable and interesting by-taste of egg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was quite bit unusual to me and I didn't ever encounter this recipe again (yet am not an expert on the topic either). So I would first and foremost like to know if that preparation method is some kind of established or regional variation of coffee and how that actually developed or what the reasons/advantages for this somehow unusual combination are, be they nutritional, historical or just because it tastes good.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;So I did a bit of research, and found a number of regional claims to 'egg coffee', including  Swedish, Norwegian, Vietnamese and the American Mid-West. Of course I also found an article on &lt;a href="http://puttingweirdthingsincoffee.com/2010/01/28/putting-an-egg-in-coffee-eggspresso/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Putting Weird Things In Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, which should be taken with a pinch of salt&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to be a variety of approaches, but they seem to fall into three main camps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add just the white and the shell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add just the &lt;em&gt;yolk&lt;/em&gt; and the shell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the whole egg, including the shell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the different techniques, adding the shell was the only real unifying theme! It's said to reduce bitterness (I imagine because the shell is essentially calcium-carbonate, which is basic). The technique is to just crush up the shell, mix it and the egg contents with the coffee and pour over boiling water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grounds will bind with the egg protein and sink in the cup. They can then be strained off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other recipe I found is specifically for Vietnamese egg coffee, which I found &lt;a href="http://www.legalnomads.com/2013/01/vietnamese-egg-coffee-recipe.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 teaspoons of Vietnamese coffee powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons of sweetened condensed milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boiling water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brew a small cup of Vietnamese coffee. Crack
an egg and discard the whites. Put the yolk and the sweetened
condensed milk in a small, deep bowl and whisk vigorously until you
end up with a frothy, fluffy mixture like the one above. Add a
tablespoon of the brewed coffee and whisk it in. In a clear coffee cup
(we’re going for aesthetics here), pour in your brewed coffee, then
add the fluffy egg mixture on top. Presto. Egg coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>What coffees are the least acidic?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I don't like coffees with an acidic/sour taste. However, when buying coffee, the only "rating" one gets is often how "strong" the coffee is, and that does not help me. Is there something else I can go on? Say, place of origin, or certain varieties that aren't acidic in taste?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lets answer this question with some data!&lt;/strong&gt; My company uses machine learning, data science, and sensory science to build flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will use a lot of graphs, because a picture is worth a thousand words but a graph can communicate a concept, to dispel a lot of the myths about acidity in coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: Roast level is the Primary determinant of sour and acidity in coffee, where lighter roast has more natural acid compounds left unbroken from maillard reaction and strecker degradation (non-enzymatic browning).  This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Differences by Region&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FChz.png" alt="Sour &amp;amp; Acidity in coffee by Country"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Green Processing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UE9Xa.png" alt="Distribution of Sour and Acidity by Green Processing"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp;amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Age of the Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gn6eJ.png" alt="Acid Degradation over Time"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale! But I don't suggest it - stale coffee lacks the caffeine and interesting flavors that make coffee wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plot shows the rate of acid degradation in coffee from its first day since roast. The red line marks the 14th day from roast, when the average coffee goes stale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Level of Roast&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uajzo.png" alt="Acidity VS Level of Roast"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph shows Sour and Acidity as a function of the level of roast; as roast increases, the average perception of acidity decreases (in coffee brewed in a chemex). The grey field shows the Standard Error within the fit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should note, why is the error so high at the highest level of roast? These are coffees considered "French" or "Italian" or even "Spanish" roasts - you should consider these coffees burnt. The fruity and interesting acids such as malic, phosphoric, and citric have been destroyed by prolonged heat exposure in the roaster, &lt;strike&gt;and these coffees contain acrylamide, a carcinogen, which is not only bad for you, but also tastes terrible.&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The levels of acrylamide, a known carcinogen, peak early in the
  roasting process (at about 120 sec).  While acrylamide is still
  detectable in fully roasted and burnt coffees, it most likely don’t
  contribute to the unpleasant, burnt flavor in over-roasted coffee. 
  Multiple studies suggest that the main chemicals that cause bad
  flavors in burnt coffee are heterocyclic aromatic amines and
  polyaromatic hydrocarbons.  These increase with roasting temperature
  and time and many compounds that fall into these categories are known
  or suspected carcinogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Differences by Brewing Method&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extension to this question, reviewing the differences in the level of acidity by brewing method has been answered here: &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/349/could-preparation-method-make-coffee-more-acidic/"&gt;Could preparation method make coffee more acidic?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it possible to burn coffee while brewing?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I know some people who refuse to drink in large coffee chains as they say that the coffee they produce tastes "burnt".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it actually possible to burn coffee while brewing, or is the flavour they're complaining about coming from something else?&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Burn? I've heard that some large chains "burn" their beans while roasting :-) But not while brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major coffee chain, seen on almost every other corner in some places, is known for their very dark, "burnt" roast. Many people like this sharp taste and associate it with caffeine and their morning pick-me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other people find this "burnt" roast to be overwhelming and consider this heavy roast to be destructive when using high-quality beans. In any case the burning happens at roast - not when brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I cost-effectively improve the coffee supply in my company break room?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I work at a company of about sixty people. Like most offices, there's a communal coffee machine in our break room. It's what I understand to be a typical drip machine, pretty confident it's a &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000BN7W8O" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Bunn VPS 12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MCNGt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00I8GC9E8" rel="noreferrer"&gt;grounds&lt;/a&gt; used are Maxwell House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x1Kd4.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filters are pretty generic looking, and the water is straight from our local tap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result of all this could charitably be described as burnt water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you can spend pretty much any amount of money on beans, roasters, grinders, presses, additives, and everything else that could possibly be coffee-related. But I'm not trying to make the &lt;em&gt;best imaginable&lt;/em&gt; cup of coffee. I'm trying to make about 200 &lt;em&gt;decent&lt;/em&gt; cups of coffee a day, for relatively little investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've cleaned out the machine with &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00CHNK5XA" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Goo Gone coffee maker cleaner&lt;/a&gt;, to no significant effect. Past that, everything I can think of involves permanent changes to the process, and I want to have some way to justify that before I push for it. Where would my investments of money and political capital be best directed?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The easiest step would be to swap out the Maxwell House coffee for something of higher quality.  If there are local roasters nearby, check to see if they do wholesale or bulk orders, and then order some 5lb. bags of coffee from them.  Since the idea is to keep costs low, they should be able to grind it for you ahead of time so that you won't have to add the cost of a grinder for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What do I need to start cold-brewing?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow"&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0765333708"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I started wondering about making my own coldbrew; it sounds delicious :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I need to start my own cold-brew?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to start with: plunging and dripping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plunging is to mix water with ground coffee, and let the mix sleep slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dripping is the same as classical hot-water dripping, except the speed is much slower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slowly / "much slower" part means about 8-12 hours, depending on the quantity of ground. For example, I use 400mL/14oz and 40g/1.5oz of ground on an 8 hour drip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beans should be quite finely ground, as cold water does not penetrate the ground as well as hot water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@henryJ exposed plunging in detail. As for dripping, it is possible to use a standard filter stand and paper filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hard part is to drip water slowly. There are cheap devices on the market. An alternative is to get one of those flasks used in chemistry class (a new one, never try with a used one---chemistry is scary). The cheapest way is probably to get an empty plastic bottle, put the cap on, use a needle to make a tiny hole in the cap, fix the bottle upside down above the ground to start dripping. The goal is for the water to pour drop by drop, at a rate of about 1 drop every couple seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it safe to use paper towel as a filter when brewing?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Are there any chemicals or dyes in most common paper towels that would be harmful if I brewed my coffee using the towel as a filter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is safe, will it affect the taste of the coffee at all?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coffee filters are subject to food grade standards. They aren't just convenient shapes and stronger than paper towels, they have substantially less toxins i.e. bleach byproducts such dioxins (strong carcinogen). As well many paper towels have various purfumes, inks and other chemicals only GRAS (generally recognized as safe) for external use on your skin. Not as a filter medium for an ingested beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as for white being devoid of dyes and chemicals.. natural wood pulp which is what filters and paper towels are made of is a murky brownish grey colour at it's lightest. If it's white it's been bleached. And in most cases with a more potent bleaching agent if the intended use is for paper towels than filter media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure you can use paper towels. Most brands won't burst suddenly and it won't kill you on the spot anymore than BPA in older water bottles or lead in drinking water. But is this where you want to save a few pennies - by using something that is going to bring unnecessary amounts of known carcinogens into your diet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll stick to coffee filters myself. And unbleached (brown) ones at that.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How important is tamping coffee for an espresso machine</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I observe that coffee servers (I refuse to use the term barista) will apply pressure to the coffee grounds using a variety of methods and pressure. This seems to vary wildly and I'd like to know how important is this? Is there some general rule of thumb when it comes to recommended pressure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts were that the fineness mattered the most for espresso machines and that reasonable enough pressure when tamping is enough but what do expert's use and believe.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Tamping is one of three key controls you have over the espresso brewing process; The others are dose (the amount of coffee used) and grind coarseness.  Together, they allow the coffee machine operator to produce a puck of the correct density and consistency through which the pressurized water can be pushed through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While techniques vary, the "rule of thumb" is to apply roughly thirty pounds of force evenly across the puck; however, the key is consistency.  Keep your variables the consistent and you'll be able to dial in the best end-product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been able to pull great shots using anything from just the weight of the tamper itself to my full weight pushed onto a puck, keeping all of the other factors where they needed to be to create the correct puck density.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is Nespresso 'real' espresso?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When I use an espresso coffee pod, I'm a little skeptical that it qualifies as real espresso. The contents of the cup don't seem to be compressed or 'tamped' in any way, and obviously there's no portafilter involved. As far as I know, steam is simply pumped through the capsule to produce coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does come out very strong, and with a decent amount of crema, but is it actually espresso?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;em&gt;traditional espresso machine&lt;/em&gt; (See &lt;a href="http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/%7Ebob/Coffee/timeline.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this history of espresso machines and production techniques&lt;/a&gt; for one view of what is &lt;em&gt;traditionally&lt;/em&gt; espresso), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;capsule-based &amp;quot;espresso&amp;quot; systems&lt;/em&gt;. There are several capsule-based espresso machines (&lt;a href="http://www.coffeereview.com/three-new-capsule-espresso-systems/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;here's a review of Nespresso and three others&lt;/a&gt;). You place a small coffee-filled capsule (a.k.a. &amp;quot;pod&amp;quot;, made of aluminium, plastic, paper-wrapped, compressed puck, or other material) into the machine and press a button; seconds later it produces a coffee beverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple point of fact, &lt;strong&gt;espresso is not &lt;em&gt;traditionally&lt;/em&gt; made with a coffee-filled capsule&lt;/strong&gt;, so the beverage produced by capsule-based machines might be disqualified from being called espresso on that trivial issue alone. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you subscribe to the &lt;a href="http://www.espressoitaliano.org/en/The-Certified-Italian-Espresso.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;INEI&lt;/a&gt; being a benchmark of &lt;a href="http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;espresso production standards (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;capsule systems may not meet INEI parameters... so if they don't, they're not an espresso on technicality alone&lt;/strong&gt;, with regard to &amp;quot;Certified Italian Espresso&amp;quot; at least. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quantity of coffee (e.g., &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nespresso" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Nespresso might be light&lt;/a&gt;);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hot water should be used for espresso (some do use pressurized water; but it's not INEI espresso if the capsule system uses steam);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some capsule systems (as noted by @EricPlaton below) &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; produce espresso-machine pressures, but there could be benefit (or problems) by &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/296/downsides-of-brewing-espresso-with-high-pressure"&gt;using pressure that is too high&lt;/a&gt;, or on the other hand &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1563/262"&gt;too low&lt;/a&gt; for extraction and crema. That said, &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress"&gt;it seems that AeroPress can create crema&lt;/a&gt; at lower pressures, so perhaps the capsule systems produce a beverage more like AeroPress than espresso.[1]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maybe.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been several taste-tests of questionable &amp;quot;legitimacy&amp;quot; between capsule-based machines and traditional espresso machines. &lt;a href="http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/julian-baggini-coffee-artisans/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;One four-subject test&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;em&gt;higher marks&lt;/em&gt; to the beverage produced from a capsule-based machine than a traditional espresso machine. &lt;a href="http://www.airtightinteractive.com/2008/09/starbucks-versus-nespresso-taste-test/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt; agrees. Another test disagreed, &lt;a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/04/nespresso-coffee-overpriced-rubbish/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;giving a capsule-based machine a scathing review&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe there are better reviews out there; these are mostly useful for anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you note, the resulting beverage from a capsule-based espresso system is similar to traditional espresso, crema and all. However, if you ordered an espresso from a proper cafe, and they gave you a beverage that was brewed using a capsule-based machine, would you feel cheated on principle? What if the beverage was indistinguishable from traditional espresso... or if you like the capsule-based system's result better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It doesn't matter.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my personal conclusion. The result of the beverage produced by a capsule-based system is a decent replica of proper espresso. Capsule systems also are likely to produce a &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; result. If you like the beverage that results (see above...), &lt;strong&gt;what difference does it make if it's &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;real&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; espresso or not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[1] Is AeroPress espresso? I think not (and @Chris in AK agreed and notes &amp;quot;Aerpresso&amp;quot; in comments!), but that's a separate question also...&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What does a coffee cherry taste like?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Do they keep long enough to ship? Can they be ordered from somewhere? Can they be dried/preserved/candied?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can the flavor be used ... perhaps in a coffee beverage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the washed and semi-washing processing, the fruit is completely removed and discarded (and presumably not recoverable). In the dry processing, the fruit is allowed to ferment before removal, which presumably contributes much of the &lt;em&gt;fruit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;wine&lt;/em&gt; notes in dry-processed coffees like Sanani from Yemen and some single-origin Ethiopian coffees (eg. Starbucks Ethiopia Shirkina). If the fruit can do this ..., there must be more potential there, right?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Lots of questions! Starting from the top...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taste?&lt;/strong&gt; Coffee cherries are mild in flavour and slightly sweet. The flavour is somewhat reminiscent of other red fruits, like a mild mix of fruits like raspberry, red mulberry, currant, cranberry, cherry, raisin. I've only had them dried, so they have a little bit of a "dried fruit" taste (e.g., as raisins are to grapes). To me, they also have a little bit of a mild taste of tobacco leaf. When steeped in water to make a drink called &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/451/yemenite-tea-like-coffee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;cascara&lt;/em&gt; (see this question/answers)&lt;/a&gt;. The beverage tastes to me a bit like rooibos (red bush tisane). Some coffee shops sell the beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping?&lt;/strong&gt; I've only seen &lt;em&gt;dried&lt;/em&gt; coffee cherries for sale. Perhaps "fresh" coffee fruits are available in the coffee belt, but the seeds (i.e., coffee beans) are so valuable that I think the whole fruit doesn't make it very far outside of production regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability?&lt;/strong&gt; Various specialty retailers sell the dried fruit pulp and skins (some call them the "husks") -- here's &lt;a href="http://www.vervecoffeeroasters.com/products/cascara-coffee-cherry-tea" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;one example from Verve&lt;/a&gt;. Searching for coffee berries, cherries, husks, or for beverages like &lt;em&gt;cascara&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;qishr&lt;/em&gt; may reveal more outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other preservation?&lt;/strong&gt; Coffee skins/pulp dry well. Rehydrating is possible but underwhelming. I have tried to make a kind of marmalade out of them; see &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1508/what-variety-of-coffee-berries-are-good-for-jam"&gt;this seminal question&lt;/a&gt;, and also &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/54942/how-should-i-make-jam-out-of-coffee-cherries-or-coffee-cherry-husks"&gt;a follow-up question of mine at Seasoned Advice&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sorry to report that I have not had much success yet. The dried cherries are tough, so not pleasant to eat outright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good ideas! I really like the stuff, and am always happy to find others, and would be happy to hear more ideas about how to eat and drink coffee cherries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; For completeness, here's a picture of dried coffee cherry pulp/skins that I use to make &lt;em&gt;cascara&lt;/em&gt;.

  <title>Does storing coffee in a freezer preserve freshness?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Does storing ground coffee in a freezer make it stay fresh longer? If so, how long will it remain fresh? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;No. In fact it's likely to make your coffee taste bad, and gum up your grinder. You should store your coffee in an air-tight container, at or just below room temp (about 25 degrees Celsius). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee can and will absorb all kinds of odors, and while your freezer probably doesn't smell like much, there are odors that will (at the minimum) dull the taste of the coffee. Additionally, when you take your coffee out to room temp, condensation kicks in which further degrades the beans &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; messes up your grind. Depending on your climate, the condensation can also invite mold. Yuck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only time you should be freezing or refrigerating coffee is when you're doing so because you've created a desert with some :) Otherwise, dark air-tight containers are the best way to go, just store them in your cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb: Store anything you buy the way it was when you bought it, unless the label tells you to do something different once you open it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How is instant coffee made?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I understand the basic process of making coffee (harvested beans &gt;&gt; roasted &gt;&gt; ground &gt;&gt; brewed), but I don't quite understand how &lt;em&gt;instant&lt;/em&gt; coffee is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What, exactly, is done differently? At what point in the process does instant coffee diverge from "real" coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How instant coffee is prepared in the factory:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee beans are roasted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are ground very finely (0.5 mm - 1.1 mm in diameter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ground coffee is mixed with water in percolation columns which reaches 155 - 180 degrees Celsius.  This is the extraction process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This mixture is then concentrated and/or dried using vacuum evaporation, freeze drying, or spray drying methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result from this is what you get in the store.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I go about developing my ability to taste flavors in coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been home-roasting coffee for over a year now, starting with stovetop pan roasting, then moving up to an air popper, and then a small roaster this Christmas. I'm at the point where I can tell a light-roasted, acidic Ethiopian from a dark Indonesian blend, but beyond that I'm frustrated by my inability to pick out specific flavors from one coffee to the next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any tips/tricks for developing this? Or some qualities that vary across coffees that are easier to taste for along with vocabulary to describe what I'm tasting? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are several approaches that can aid in developing your palate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cupping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preferred method of tasting coffee. This requires only a cupping bowl and spoon. Dose out coffee, pour in the hot water evenly, and at 4 minutes skim off the top to remove the crust while carefully not disturbing what has settled at the bottom. Wait about 12-14 minutes for the coffee to cool to a desirable drinking temperature, and slurp the coffee with the spoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Types of flavors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a variety of descriptions you can use to describe the coffee. Try describe everything. The mouth feel: is it full bodied or light? The acidity: Is it citric or stone fruit? The Smell: What are the aromatics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Note keeping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you taste coffee, keep notes of what flavors you taste. Basic notes of chocolate or smoke are fine, more nuanced flavors like cherry or plum may come out. Don't be afraid to write exactly what comes to mind. If the coffee tastes like captain crunch then write it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Comparing coffee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't just taste your coffee by itself. Compare it to other roasts you've done. Compare it to coffees from other cafes as well. Note the differences.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What gives "diner" coffee its distinctive taste?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;At least in the US (and probably elsewhere), late-night diners are a popular place to get a cheap cup of joe. In my experience, diner coffee has a taste that's generally not found elsewhere (most people call it "bad", but that's not what this question is about).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering what causes this taste, and how they all get such similar tasting coffee? I assume the brewing process has something to do with it (those big commercial drip brewers which they all seem to use), but I've been to other places that used those with various different roasts and they all tasted different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what else makes diner coffee taste like diner coffee? Examples of the kinds of places that serve this include chains like Waffle House, but also individual / locally owned diners.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think it is a combination of old stale grounds sitting on a burner for long hours. The places you mention are generally open 24/7 or something close to it and have people ordering coffee at all times of day, so it's all made ahead of time and kept warm all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheapest coffee suppliers usually mix beans from all over the place and they all store them way past any freshness date. Diners run on small budgets and generally buy the cheapest stuff, thus they all have the same "flavor".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That combination is not just a diner thing, I would also say it is the same as cheap gas station coffee in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would knock it more if it didn't keep me awake behind the wheel more than a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why would anyone want to hand grind their coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I often buy pre-roasted beans so that they last longer in storage. This means I have to grind the beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a cheap spice grinder that does a great job at preparing the beans into ground coffee. It is easy to use, takes 5-15 seconds to process half a dozen cups worth of beans, and I have  good control over how fine a powder to make the beans into. I'm pretty sure this is a similar story for almost everyone with an electric grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a friend using a hand grinder. It took far longer and from what I saw there was &lt;strong&gt;no discernable difference&lt;/strong&gt; between hand ground coffee and machine ground coffee &lt;strong&gt;in terms of texture&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;em&gt;(if anything the texture was less consistent when hand ground)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this, why on earth would anyone want to hand grind?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Hand grinders will work without electricity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can generally get a conical hand grinder cheaper than you can get an electric one.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also create less noise than a electric grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hand grinders will generally produce less heat than an electric (may affect bean flavor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many grinders are lighter and smaller than electric ones. They are portable and can easily be packed for use when traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the consistency, a conical grinder (electric or manual) will generally create a more consistent grind than a electric blade "grinder".  Electric blade grinders tend to produce dust and boulders.  I know because I use one at work daily and I can see the inconsistency in the grind, but it doesn't bother me that much.  At home, my burr grinder creates a much more consistent grind.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>End result of Americano vs Long Black?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There have been a few questions now asked about the difference between a Caffe Americano vs a Long Black and the merits of each (&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/164/when-making-a-long-black-how-long-should-hot-water-cool-before-adding-espresso"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/402/procedure-for-making-a-caffe-americano/404#404"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  The main difference seems to be that the Long Black method of adding the espresso after the hot water preserves the crema better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I conducted an experiment and created an Americano and a Long Black simultaneously using a La Marzocco. Immediately after brewing the result was as expected with the Long Black having more crema.  However, by the time they had sat a bit and cooled enough to drink (approximately 2 minutes), the crema had broken down and they looked almost identical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the crema breaking up during brewing (Americano) or shortly thereafter (Long Black) really make a difference/affect the taste?  If not, is the difference merely academic or is there some other reason why the order of operations matters?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The crema definitely affects the initial taste of the coffee, that's where the concentrated notes of whatever bean you're using is going to be found. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make a long black by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pour 3/4 cup of hot water (right from the machine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait 2 - 3 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull a double shot into it, holding it &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; under the group to minimize splashing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let sit for about 30 seconds, serve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, I make an Americano by just pulling a double shot into a cup while also taking care to minimize splashing, then I serve it with a small steel or ceramic carafe of hot water (everyone likes a little more or a little less than everyone else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both instances, I heat the cup, and that's important because the crema will quickly break up on the walls of the cup if you don't. Most good espresso machines allow you to heat cups on the top of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, my testing is somewhat limited because I drink good quality Arabica beans pretty much exclusively. Arabica has some subtle flavors and it's easy to tell when they're more pronounced. Long blacks &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; hit the caramel notes more, in my experience. But, I usually just make myself an Americano because it's easier and the taste isn't all &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; different. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done at home using a &lt;a href="http://www.brevilleusa.com/the-barista-expresstm.html"&gt;Breville Barista Express&lt;/a&gt; in manual mode. You don't really need a super expensive machine to replicate this, you just need the ability to pre-infuse, warm the cup, and be able to wrangle one under the group to minimize splashing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concluding, I think there's some substance to this. However, I'm not sure how much it really matters to someone kind of fumbling around to get their first cup of the day. It took close to a dozen tries to finally get a process down where the taste was noticeable and I could reliably reproduce it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you order either at your average coffee shop, I don't know that you'd be able to tell the difference, I never have. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the next best milk substitute for a latte?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I used to drink lattes every day and realized the milk (lactose) was making me feel bad. I'm looking for a good substitute that will steam well, taste good, and be nice for making latte art. What will get me closest? Soy milk? Lactaid? Unsweetened almond milk?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Here's another take, but going in the direction more of performance for foam (i.e., more for cappuccino than latte), mostly because I found links about that :) and because &lt;a href="http://coffeegeek.com/guides/frothingguide/steamguide" rel="noreferrer"&gt;steamed milk should foam&lt;/a&gt;. If you're not looking for much foam, the differences are probably less profound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a few other plant-based milks out there also; coconut and rice weren't mentioned in the other answers. In sum, I know of 5 common plant milks: almond, coconut, hemp, rice, soy. But there are probably others as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's some comparisons, summarized from the linked articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube video - &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR_F9ZikWv8" rel="noreferrer"&gt;milk froth-off&lt;/a&gt;. They compare rice, coconut, and almond. They got the best performance with almond milk, coconut did almost as well, and rice milk did not perform well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MarkBittman dot com has an article on &lt;a href="http://markbittman.com/the-milk-chronicles-in-search-of-vegan-cappuc/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the search for a vegan cappuccino&lt;/a&gt;. It suggests that soy is the best alternative for foam, followed by almond. The text and comments suggest (but doesn't outright state) that hemp works well also.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.peacefuldumpling.com/top-3-milk-alternatives-baristas-guide" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Peaceful Dumpling&lt;/a&gt; article (linked previously in @PythonMaster's answer; summarizing the original article's conclusions here) concludes that soy is best, followed closely by hemp, and that almond doesn't work as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusions tend to be suggest that cow milk will perform better than plant-based "milks." This probably suggests that lactose-free milks (i.e., with lactase, like Lactaid and others) will be &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; best bet. Of course, you could always take a lactase pill and enjoy your cup with conventional milk. Various articles suggest that certain soy milks are best, and that coconut, hemp, and almond will also work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a ton of other factors, but these probably reduce to preference: some milks will be sweetened, or import their own taste (e.g., almond, coconut). Others might have emulsifiers or other additives (such as carrageenan), which impact the steaming (maybe helping or hurting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another take would be to look at the "science" of what happens during steaming: it's a combination of fats and proteins that are being agitated and changed in the right way to make foam.  &lt;a href="http://coffeegeek.com/guides/frothingguide/milk" rel="noreferrer"&gt;This CoffeeGeek article&lt;/a&gt; discusses frothing and what's at work; this was interesting for me, and might help you pick a milk based on protein and fat content among the various milk options.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Latte: Milk before or after coffee?</title>

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With espresso shot first and then milk and art on top (served in a normal cup)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milk first and espresso shot poured on top (served in a long glass with a handle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are both of these technically lattes or is the second way something different entirely?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Oh, the famous &lt;em&gt;latte&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently hardly anyone knows that it simply means "milk" in Italian, so technically calling a coffee drink "latte" is pure nonsense.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where does the coffee shop staple get his name from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Italy, a &lt;a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte_macchiato" rel="noreferrer"&gt;latte macchiato&lt;/a&gt; ("stained milk") is basically an espresso in a glass of hot (steamed) milk, pouring the espresso last leads to the distinct layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffellatte" rel="noreferrer"&gt;caffellatte&lt;/a&gt; ("coffee with milk") is an espresso or coffee from a moka, topped with a generous dose of hot milk. No layers in this cup or glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So depending on whether your coffee shop makes &lt;strong&gt;&lt;del&gt;caffel&lt;/del&gt;latte&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;latte &lt;del&gt;macchiato&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, you get milk first or coffee first, layers or none.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the difference between Robusta and Arabica?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Different coffee packets advertise different amounts of 'Robusta' and 'Arabica'? What do these terms refer to, and how does it affect the taste of the coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MzlPd.png" alt="THIS SHOULD HELP :)" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One reason that the taste isn't as good for Robusta is that it has more caffeine compared to Arabica. Which may sound like a positive thing but caffeine carries a bitter taste which makes it an unpleasant drink. In fact the Robusta bean has 2.7% caffeine content, almost double the 1.5% of Arabica.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arabica contains almost 60% more lipids and almost twice the concentration of sugar than Robusta. This factor also probably has a big impact on why we prefer the taste of Arabica.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a price perspective, green beans of Robusta is about half the price of Arabica green beans on the commodity market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robusta is easier to tend to on the farm, has a higher yield and is less sensitive to insects - the extra caffeine is a chemical defense for the coffee seed as the quantity in the Robusta is toxic to bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these factors help bring up the supply and lower the input costs for farmers to produce. With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits. When coffee was initially sold in the 1900s the quality of coffee slowly and slowly deteriorated in an effort for companies to squeeze the most profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you’ll find it: Nowadays, it’s not often you’ll find Robusta in a coffee blends or in coffee shop. If you’re drinking instant coffee? Well, that’s probably all Robusta… but you probably don’t care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? That’s a mixed bag. Literally. Oddly enough, Robusta is still widely used as part of espresso blends – specifically Italian style blends. &lt;em&gt;It is said to help improve&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;crema&lt;/strong&gt;.
One thing to note is despite the association with Arabica of being higher quality, and Robusta as being lower quality, it’s not always the case. Top notch specialty Robusta coffee will usually taste as good as or better than low end Arabica. However, high end Robusta isn’t widely used or available. Rather, Robusta is usually used as a filler or cost reducer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robusta beans are much more circular, whereas Arabica are more oval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chlorogenic acid is a significant antioxidant and an insect deterrent. Robusta is 7-10% CGA and Arabica has 5.5-8% CGA.&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Does coffee cause dehydration?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Actual scientific information on the effects of food and drink is notoriously hard to sift from all the dieting pseudoscience. I know that caffeine is a diuretic, which means it will cause me to lose more water, but given that I'm dosing up on it with water, will I lose more water than I gain? Even if it doesn't for longer drinks, will drinking espresso result in a net loss of water?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Though caffeine's action as a diuretic is hotly debated, recently it seems the scientific consensus is that caffeine in normal doses is a weak diuretic in &lt;em&gt;caffeine-naive&lt;/em&gt; individuals only (those without a tolerance), and only in doses exceeding 250-300 mg, or 2-3 cups of coffee. To go even further,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A profound tolerance to the diuretic and other effects of caffeine
  develops, however, and the actions are much diminished in individuals
  who regularly consume tea or coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from the same &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19774754"&gt;review of the literature&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Doses of caffeine equivalent to the amount normally found in standard
  servings of tea, coffee and carbonated soft drinks appear to have no
  diuretic action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Times exposed this myth in this &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/health/nutrition/04real.html?_r=0"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Researchers found no significant differences in levels of excreted
  electrolytes or urine volume [between those given caffeine and a placebo].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <title>Coffee cup patina; is there any logic in not washing the cup</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I first encountered the practice of never washing a coffee cup, when I was sternly warned, and nearly physically threatened by a former employer to never wash his coffee cup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently it is &lt;a href="http://www.navyhistory.org/2013/11/dont-wash-that-coffee-mug/"&gt;an old military tradition&lt;/a&gt; to never wash out your coffee cup, and being a retired service man he continued the practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any logic behind this, does it noticeably effect the coffee, or is this just an old, superstitious tradition?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It may be superstition but many people, myself included, don't wash out their coffee cups. I rinse out my cup but don't wash it - I don't want soap going into my favorite coffee cup. I like the way it smells of coffee. I don't have to see or touch my favorite coffee or tea cup to know which one is which. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition I never use soap on either my coffee or tea filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would I notice the difference if I had two identical mugs - one with the "patina" and one without? Maybe not. But I prefer it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I get started in roasting my own beans at home?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'd like to experiment with roasting my own beans at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to keep the equipment requirements as basic as possible. No fancy gizmos or machines. I have a gas stove. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to roast your own coffee at home on low budget:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the extremely minimalistic ways to roast coffee, but the degree of complexity is very high as the coffee beans need constant attention due to the nature of the heat that arrises only from one side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Oven&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is likely one of the most common ways to roast coffee at home and a significant step up from the pan, hence the heat is more homogenous. You are still required to mix the coffee now and then hence the plate usually becomes hotter than the upper part of the coffee beans while in the oven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Popcorn machine&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is likely the best method to use at home, but also very messy as the chaff is likely to twirl around while the coffee is being roasted. A method for catching the chaff could be a simple filter that can tolerate heat or a oversized strainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Roasting tips&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never leave the coffee while roasting, the process can escalate very quickly and turn your beans into coal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cool down your beans quickly after the roasting process, do not leave it on the heat source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee generates chaff which has to be disposed, this is usually a pain when roasting in the oven and pan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a thermometer so you can log the roasting time and duration for analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roasting can generate a lot of smoke so either roast outside, near a window or use ventilation.&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Difference between Turkish and Greek coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is there a difference between Turkish and Greek coffee? Or is it the same thing with different names at different places?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;...also called Arabic, Cypriot, Bosnian, and what not -- it is the same method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Greece, it's become &lt;em&gt;Greek coffee&lt;/em&gt; (along with the former "Turkish" &lt;em&gt;Greek delight&lt;/em&gt;) after conflicting with Turkey and the 1974 invasion of Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method itself (boiling finely ground coffee in copper cezve, typically sweetened, and served in a demitasse) is said to stem from 15th century Yemen, reaching Constantinople in 17th century and consequently spreading across Ottoman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, there are interesting variations to it. For instance, &lt;em&gt;Syrian coffee&lt;/em&gt; (and probably some others) is flavoured by cardamom.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You should not tamp the coffee in a Moka. These pots don't like excessive pressure, which tamping would produce due to increased density. This is also why the water should not cover the steam valve. In the worst case they can literally explode!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Research funding for health benefits by coffee trade associations</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;How much funding is provided by the coffee industry for research on the health benefits of coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across a statistic that surprised me by its meagerness.  According to &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150323060240/http://www.ncausa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=880" rel="noreferrer"&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;, the National Coffee Association USA has spent $6 million on research funding over the last 20 or so years.  The NCAUSA cites 80 specific investigations that they funded. (I don't know if the trend is up or down over the two decades.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From reading Antony Wild's &lt;a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/coffee-antony-wild/1112483551?ean=9780393060713" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Coffee: A Dark History&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, it was my impression that the coffee industry sets great importance on &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/04/health/coffee-myth-fact/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;demonstrable health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. See in particular Chapt. 14, Coffee, Science and History.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book mentions specifically the &lt;a href="http://vanderbilt.edu/ics/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Vanderbilt Institute for Coffee Studies&lt;/a&gt; as funded by "a $6 million grant from the coffee industry" to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in 1999.  (In 2007 the Institute moved its affiliation from the Medical Center to the Vanderbilt Center for Latin American Studies, but continues investigating "the health effects of coffee consumption, including potential therapeutic uses".)  While some of this funding came from NCAUSA, it appears the bulk came from the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC), with additional funding by the All Japan Coffee Association and the International Coffee Organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global coffee commodity market has annual sales &lt;a href="http://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProduct_TS.aspx?nvpm=|||||0901|||4|1|1|2|2|1|2|1|" rel="noreferrer"&gt;well-up in the tens of billions($)&lt;/a&gt;, so I would expect more in annual research funding than the average $300K/yr reported by NCAUSA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added:&lt;/strong&gt; Apparently it is difficult for coffee trade associations to survive.  The NCAUSA cited above is ancient in comparison to other organizations mentioned.  The Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/business/world-markets-a-new-coffee-cartel-tries-its-hand.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;began in 1993&lt;/a&gt; with a model of OPEC-like price supports through agreed upon limitations of exports, but &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1608356.stm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;dissolved at the beginning of 2002&lt;/a&gt;.  So a dimension of this topic is the limited degree to which coffee producers and manufacturers are able to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>What are the reasons to roast coffee yourself?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Based on some common sense and on (not very numerous) articles online, I could think of the following advantages of roasting at home:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you get the freshest possible coffee as you need it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;green beans are significantly cheaper than roasted ones, and keep longer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you get finer control over the result (?) than just guided by labels on coffee bags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are also downsides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there's smoke during the roasting that you need to handle (see also &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/186/277"&gt;Home roasting and ventilation&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need some specialized (and more or less expensive) equipment, or else invent tricks &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/2093/277"&gt;with a popcorn popper&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.angelfire.com/pro2/panroastingcoffee/howtopanroastcoffee2.html/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a cast iron pan&lt;/a&gt; (which may not be too bad in fact)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in order to obtain the finer control over the result you need to know what you're doing (which probably means you may not get a better-than-shop result in a number of initial trials) (e.g., &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1686/277"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that is my armchair coffee science though, and I hope that the practitioners here can say what of that is real and what is fictional, and what other reasons there are pro and contra homeroasting.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You have already listed most of the main points and hit them correctly, but I'll add some additional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros:
You can get things not available commercially, and generally a much wider variety of coffee.  For instance, almost all Sumatran coffee is traditionally dark roasted by companies.  However, light roasted Sumatran coffee has a truly unique set of flavors that is fairly distinct from anything else, without light roasting some yourself, you'd be hard pressed (or French pressed if you are into that) to ever find it fresh.  Tastes are remarkably individual and it's highly likely that you like may really like some random type of coffee that either isn't a big seller and available, or isn't traditionally roasted how you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons:
Time.  Roasting takes some amount of your time.  It takes far more when you start (I can now roast a pound of coffee in roughly 5 minutes of my time, because the machine does most of the work and I have a system).  Depending on your equipment and learning curve, this can vary widely.  With the equipment I started with and my initial knowledge, a pound of coffee would have taken me a full hour to roast.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snobbery.  You will likely get to the point were most other coffee that's commercially produced will be unthinkable to you.  I can't drink coffee at any restaurant without cream (I normally drink it black).  I have a few friends who roast and their coffee is the exception.  But, more or less, home roasting may ruin "other" coffee for you.  Along these lines, you may get to the point where you don't enjoy roasting as much anymore, you just want the coffee.  If your time curve is fine, then it works out.  If it's not you might be left with the terrible choice between doing something you don't love or buying less good coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why do we need to fold the border of filters?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Standard and V60 paper filters require we fold the border before spreading them for dripping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this is just because of their manufacturing process. But would there be any other reason?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folding that border makes the surface uneven in the end, and it can sometimes be harder to control the water flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R6Tms.jpg" alt="Folded border on a V60 filter"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I did a little bit of research at the site of inventor of the coffee filter. It's Melitta from Germany. In the &lt;a href="http://www.melitta.de/de/FAQ-229.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;german FAQ&lt;/a&gt; I found the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warum falte ich Filterpapier vor dem Einlegen um?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damit die Kaffeezubereitung optimal funktioniert, muss das
Filterpapier genau in die Form des Filters gebracht werden. Dies
geschieht, indem Sie die beiden geprägten Ränder umfalten. Das
Filterpapier schmiegt sich dadurch an den Rand des Filters an und
sitzt tief im Filtereinsatz. Durch diese gute Passform kann sich das
Filterpapier während des Brühvorgangs nicht einklappen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In English:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I fold the coffee filter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for the coffee preparation to work optimally, the filter paper must be brought exactly into the shape of the filter. This is done by folding over the two embossed edges. This causes the filter paper to nestle against the edge of the filter and sit deep in the filter insert. This good fit prevents the filter paper from folding in during the brewing process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional fact: The coffee filter was not invented by Melitta the company, but by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melitta_Bentz" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Melitta Bentz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Should I thoroughly clean the portafilter basket between shots?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When I'm making lots of individual drinks I tend to clean the portafilter basket thoroughly and then dry it before filling it again etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've watched baristas and they tend to just knock the old coffee out and immediately refil the portafilter without cleaning. I'd have thought that this would create bitter coffee as the grounds will already have been through one extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it accepted that you should clean the portafilter between shots, or is it ok to reuse?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There's a trade-off here. If you're working in a fast-paced coffee shop, you're likely to favour the faster option (knock out the coffee) over cleaning. Generally knocking out the coffee will get rid of &gt;99% of the grounds from the previous pull, so the impact on the flavour of the next one will be so slight as to be unnoticeable. Usually the portafilter won't even have time to dry out, so the coffee won't dry on and clog up the portafilter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're making multiple coffees one after another, reusing the portafilter is probably acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However if you're leaving the coffee machine alone, it's best to at least rinse out the portafilter before you (or the next person) comes to use it. Once the grounds/coffee start to dry, it'll clog up and be much harder to clean further down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How is decaffeinated coffee made?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tNs6ym.jpg" alt="what&amp;#39;s the difference between regular and decaf coffee"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay but seriously, how is decaffeinated coffee made? How does this process affect the flavour? (I'm assuming it does because decaffeinated coffee seems to be the source of much derision...)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h2&gt;Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decaffeination&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;decaf&lt;/em&gt;) is the removal of &lt;strong&gt;caffeine&lt;/strong&gt; from coffee beans, cocoa,  and other caffeine-containing materials. While soft drinks which do not use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as &amp;quot;decaffeinated&amp;quot;, they are better termed &amp;quot;uncaffeinated&amp;quot; because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present at one point in time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1–2% of the original caffeine content or sometimes as much as 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is usually performed on unroasted (green) beans, and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the international standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass as per the EU standard). Coffee contains over 400 components important to the taste and aroma of the drink, so it is difficult to remove the caffeine without affecting other components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know even more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, then, let's talk about the two most common types of decaffeination:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Swiss Water process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of water as the solvent to decaffeinate coffee was originally pioneered in Switzerland in 1933 and developed as a commercially viable method of decaffeination by Coffex S.A. in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is different in that it does not directly or indirectly add chemicals to extract the caffeine. Rather, it relies entirely on two concepts - solubility and osmosis - to decaffeinate coffee beans. The process begins by immersing a batch of green coffee beans in very hot water in order to dissolve and extract the caffeine. The water is then drawn off and passed through an activated charcoal filter. The porosity of this filter is sized to only capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through it. However, this extraction process will also extract desirable oils and other solids from the beans, resulting in beans with no caffeine and no flavor in one tank, and caffeine-free but with flavor water in another tank. The Swiss Water process method attempts to overcome this difficulty by first discarding the flavorless caffeine-free beans, and then reusing the flavor rich water to remove the caffeine from a fresh batch of coffee beans. Water saturated in this way is referred to as green coffee extract or GCE. It is created using a separate batch of green coffee beans, which are immersed in water and then discarded. In a pre-loading tank water, cane sugar and formic acid are mixed and heated and used to preload carbon filter columns. The GCE is then filtered over the columns to extract caffeine from it. A fresh batch of green coffee beans is then immersed in the GCE to remove caffeine but retain other components. The other components can be retained because the water is already saturated with flavor ingredients, therefore, the flavors in this fresh bath cannot dissolve - only caffeine moves from the coffee beans to the water. This results in decaffeination without a massive loss of flavor. The process of filtering the GCE to remove caffeine and immersing the beans is repeated until the beans are 99.9% caffeine free by mass, meeting the required standard. This process takes 8 to 10 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. This method is the most recent method developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Plank Institute, and uses liquid CO2 in place of chemical solvents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts selectively on the caffeine, releasing the alkaloid and nothing else. Water soaked coffee beans are placed in an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 pounds per square inch to extract the caffeine. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using charcoal filters and the caffeine free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances.

  <title>How long should I steep in French press before decanting?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a 12-cup (51 oz.) Bodum French press. Generally how long am I supposed to wait for the freshly pressed grounds to steep before I decant?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I follow the steps in &lt;a href="https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/french-press" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the Stumptown Roasters guide&lt;/a&gt;, which actually features a Bodum French Press. &lt;strong&gt;The answer is 4 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;, but it includes a mixing step after the 1 minute mark. From the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...pour hot water (30 seconds off the boil or about 205 degrees F) into the French press, saturating all of your grounds, and pouring to the halfway mark. Start your timer for 4 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 1 minute, stir the “bloom” (or top layer) and pour the rest of the water evenly to the top and affix the press pot lid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the 4 minute timer goes off, plunge and serve.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is reheating coffee in the microwave a bad idea?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get distracted, and realise I've got a cold cup of coffee on my desk. Will reheating it in the microwave do bad things to it? I've heard people say it will alter the flavour, and some people even say that the effect of the microwave on the coffee will produce medically harmful chemicals. Is this true? Should I just chuck it and make a fresh brew?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Although coffee generally becomes staler with time, heating coffee up in the microwave &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; produce any harmful chemicals - as long as the container you are microwaving it in is microwave-safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microwaves emitted inside the microwave are a relatively safe form of radiation that cause the &lt;strong&gt;water&lt;/strong&gt; molecules in the coffee to move faster, thus creating heat. This is relatively harmless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as taste goes, you may consider just making a new coffee, as this will always taste better, in my opinion!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's the difference between a percolator and a moka pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What's the difference between a percolator and a moka pot?  For example, differences in the device itself, the method of use, and the resulting brew?  They seem somewhat similar, since both are stovetop coffee production devices. I see some questions tagged &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/moka" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;moka&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;moka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/percolator" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;percolator&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;percolator&lt;/a&gt;, but none yet seem to discuss the fundamental preparation method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/97/262"&gt;This question&lt;/a&gt; seems to suggest they are synonymous. Are there regional differences in use of these terms?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;moka pot&lt;/a&gt; is what some call a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso_machine#Stove_top" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;stovetop espresso maker&lt;/a&gt;; I find this to be a bit of a misnomer, because the result is rather different than proper espresso. Water is put into a bottom vessel; coffee grounds are placed on a perforated platform with attached cone, which is placed on/in the water vessel; a top holding tank with rubber gasket is screwed on top of the apparatus. The device is placed over a heat source, boiling the water;  the boiling water creates steam and pressure, which forces water through the grounds into the upper storage vessel.  The two chambers are separate, so the water is forced through the grounds once (upward). Somewhat similar to espresso, a moka pot develops some small amount of pressure to force (nearly boiling) water through grounds, though the pressure is much less than espresso (see also &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/298/262"&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;). I don't think the grounds are meant to be tamped like espresso, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_percolator" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;percolator&lt;/a&gt; boils water and drips it over grounds continuously.  There is no separate storage vessel for the coffee once brewed; water (at first) or (partially-brewed) coffee is continuously boiled (passing up to the top of the chamber through a funnel/straw) and dripped over the grounds (which are instead at the top of the chamber, rather than in the middle as in the moka pot).  The brewed coffee ends up in the same place the plain water was at the beginning of the brew. Percolators often have a clever little clear cap in the middle of the top, so you can see when the brewing is occurring, and color of the brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have both devices, and use them differently; e.g., a coarser grind for percolator.  I find the outcome of percolated coffee to be more like French press or perhaps drip; moka is more like Turkish coffee or espresso. Though similar in concept (stovetop coffee production devices), they're (to me) totally different in outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect, but I don't know, if there are regional differences in these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: this &lt;a href="https://coffee.meta.stackexchange.com/q/60/262"&gt;meta question&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://coffee.meta.stackexchange.com/a/74/262"&gt;my answer&lt;/a&gt; prompted this adaptation as a clarification question.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee Bean Vs Espresso Bean</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between beans intended for coffee use vs beans intended for espresso?  My understanding is the beans come from the same plants &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/458/are-robusta-and-arabica-the-only-bean-varieties"&gt;as mentioned previously&lt;/a&gt; but they are prepared differently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens to coffee beans before they are packaged for consumers?  How are some prepared in a way that make them better suited for espresso brewing vs coffee brewing?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;First of all, there is no difference in the beans themselves. They all come from either Robusta or Arabica plants. The roast doesn't vary either. You can use any kind of roast for your espresso, it's up to preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; change is the grind. Espresso grind is very fine - much finer than other preparations of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may find packaged coffee sold as 'espresso beans' or 'espresso roast' being darker/bolder roasts, to emulate a darker, stronger coffee regardless of preparation, however it has little to do with real espresso (and you may even find 'espresso' ground coffees being sold with a large/inconsistent grind!).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's the recommended coffee to water ratio for cold brew?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was interested today in making some cold brew. I have a french press so I'd like to use that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your recommended brewing time?
Does this make a concentrate?
What ratio do you use later to dilute that concentrate?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;First, make sure to study &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/400/277"&gt;What do I need to start cold-brewing&lt;/a&gt;. But since concentrate is not discussed there, I don't think your question is a duplicate. Your French press concentrate could last a couple days, depending on the consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you divide the volume of the French press by 5, you would need 1 part of ground coffee (the usual coarse grind you use in the press; extraction is weaker at low temperatures but the time makes up for it even with coarse grind) and 4 parts of fresh room-temperature water, which you gently mix and stir. The coffee should sit for about 12-16 hours at room temperature. Then plunge, and here is the concentrate. To dilute, use another 8 parts of cold water or milk (or better, start with 5-6 parts and taste to determine whether you want it still thinner).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's my &lt;a href="http://imbibemagazine.com/Iced-Coffee-How-To/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;favourite article&lt;/a&gt; that discusses dripping methods as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I made my coffee in big batch and freeze what I did not manage to drink?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's put away why would I even want to do it. And for sake of argument, I know it is probably bad idea, but still:&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is a perfectly good idea, if you freeze the coffee as cubes and plan to use them to chill your iced coffee without watering it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you plan to simply freeze the coffee for drinking later I can imagine it being a bad idea, because you &lt;strong&gt;will lose some of the flavor&lt;/strong&gt;. If you even poured milk or cream into the coffee you're planning to freeze, I would even recommend less freezing it, because no kind of milk products can be safely frozen and those are always better used fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does water remain in the bottom chamber after brewing with a moka pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;We are new owners of a Espress Nero four cup Moka Pot by Vev-Vigano.  We have followed instructions from print sources, on-line articles, and YouTube videos and have yet to see reference as to why the pouring pot is only half full while the boiler still has water in it when the pot starts to gurgle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does some water remain in the bottom chamber of the moka pot after brewing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a moka pot, the downward spout of the funnel does not reach all the way to the bottom of the pot. Brewing will stop once the level of water in the pot falls below the bottom of the funnel (if you carry on brewing after this point, you'll be making coffee with the superheated steam, which will be burnt and bitter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why this is how it works, but I guess it's to prevent the pot from boiling dry, and retaining a thermal mass in the bottom pot to help it cool down again.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>How does the temperature of the water affect the taste of the coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Many methods of brewing coffee differ in the temperature of the water among other factors. Some people swear by cold-brewing, others do slow pour overs with piping hot water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How exactly is coffee flavor changed by cold, warm, and hot water?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature affects extraction rate, but also varies between compounds in the coffee beans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee grounds contain a hodgepodge of volatile and non-volatile components, such as various oils, acids, and other aromatic molecules [2]. Collectively, these compounds that are found in coffee grounds are referred to as “coffee solubles” and significantly contribute to coffee flavor [2]. Brewing is the process of extracting these components from the grounds, so coffee beverages are technically a solution of coffee solubles and water. Given that coffee grounds are used in both of our brewing methods, the principle variables are temperature and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205°F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where cold brew lacks in temperature, it makes up for in time. Coffee solubles have markedly decreased solubility in room temperature water. Increasing the brew time from a few minutes to many hours aims to maximize extraction of the solubles from the grounds. Even over twenty-four hours, not all the coffee solubles will have dissolved; this is why the amount of coffee grounds is doubled, in an effort to make up for the lower extraction rate. In comparison with hot brew, cold brew is sometimes described as tasting “dead” or “flat” due to the lower yield of coffee solubles [3]. Further, decreased volatility prevents aromatics from escaping from coffee as easily, so cold brew is much less perfumed than its hot brew counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidation and degradation will still occur in cold brew methods, but this happens much more slowly; bitterness and acidity are just about absent in cold brew coffee, especially if it is kept cold. Though, cold brew doesn’t merely taste like hot brew without the bitterness. Fans of the cold brew method have emphasized that cold brews contain a completely different flavor profile that can’t be found with hot brews. Going back to the idea of solubility, not all flavor compounds of coffee solubles are equally soluble. A good majority of the coffee solubles are still able to leach out of the grounds, even in colder water. The compounds that don’t dissolve are the ones often attributed to unfavorable flavors [4]: these stay in the grounds that are subsequently tossed away. Consequently, cold brews take on a much sweeter, floral profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To note, brew time does not determine caffeine content, nor does bitterness indicate coffee strength. Caffeine is extracted early in the brewing process, so extending brew time, by either method, would only result in over-extracted coffee [1]. Coffee “strength” is defined as the amount of dissolved coffee solubles per unit of coffee volume [1]. On that train of thought, cold brew certainly produces stronger coffee, given that the brewing process purposely concentrates the coffee solubles. Though, keep in mind that rarely anyone drinks cold brew coffee straight up; many enjoy this smooth drink diluted with milk or water. - &lt;a href="https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Coffee Brewing Chemistry: Hot Brew vs. Cold Brew.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What type of roast has the lowest caffeine content?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm aiming to reduce my caffeine intake, but don't want to drop coffee altogether. What roasts / beans release the least amount of caffeine into my body when drank?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In general, &lt;strong&gt;darker, arabica&lt;/strong&gt; roasts have less caffeine. Arabica (as opposed to robusta) inherently has less caffeine in it naturally, and darker coffees have less caffeine since they have been roasted longer or at higher temperatures, &lt;strike&gt;essentially "burning" the caffeine out of the bean.
&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some science, Arabica is usually found to be about 1.2% caffeine and Robusta is typically 2.2% caffeine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://coffeechemistry.com/agriculture/differences-between-arabica-and-robusta-coffee.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Differences between Arabica and Robusta Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris in AK has a great explanation in the comments as to why darker roasts are &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; to have less caffeine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is a common misconception that darker roasts have less caffeine.  Caffeine's melting point is 455F which is well above what most beans reach during the roasting process.  Essentially, caffeine content changes because the mass/density of the beans change (they lose water and undergo changes in the roasting process).   If you measure your coffee by volume, dense greener beans will have more caffeine.  If you measure by weight, darker roasted beans will have more caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What differentiates a $100 coffee machine from a $1000 coffee machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There is a huge amount of price variance for coffee machines. Just a quick look in any shop will reveal two espresso machines, made by the same manufacturer, one in the $100 range, and another in the $1000 range. For the purposes of simply making espresso from ground coffee, what is the difference between them?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;More expensive coffee machines typically have better "plumbing", including some and even all of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 boilers / HX&lt;/strong&gt; to allow for frothing and brewing at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preinfusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copper boilers&lt;/strong&gt; vs. cheaper aluminium versions (guarantees better temperature stability)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larger boilers&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing for more shots to be drawn/ milk to be frothed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wider portafilters&lt;/strong&gt; (which in some peoples' opinion gives better flavour)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3-way valves&lt;/strong&gt; to allow back-built pressure to evacuate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a real steam wand&lt;/strong&gt;, no gimmicky plastic ones that promise the world and don't deliver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the ability to be plumbed&lt;/strong&gt; (connected to your water drain so you don't have to manually clear out the water tray.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The option of vibration vs. &lt;strong&gt;rotary pumps&lt;/strong&gt; (which are quieter, although I think they are more likely to break if there is no water)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customisability of technical factors&lt;/strong&gt; (pressure, temperature) which gives more control for our crazy data-obsessed coffee needs :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this doesn't mean you can't get good coffee on a cheaper machine. You're just going to have to put more effort in it and get more variable results. Which is more than fair for most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the price difference, most of these features will raise the price by themselves and a lot of the more expensive machines are hand-made as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last point&lt;/strong&gt; they are also very pretty and a status symbol, not to the extent of let's say a very expensive watch but it does sort of feel that way sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm assuming it's the same here, so what is it about a latte that makes it suited for this shape of mug?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It may be just me, but I think it has to do with aiming for a ratio of foam to liquid in each sip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically a taller cylindrical cup with the same amount of foam on it would cause the first couple of sips to be mostly, if not entirely, foam. With a shorter wider cup you can have a lot of foam, but in a thinner layer, allowing for a more balanced sip and better mouth feel through the duration of the cup.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Advantages and disadvantages of French press</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Asking around, I've noticed that public opinion about the french press is rather mixed. I've heard people shun it and others praise it. I have never actually seen a decent explanation why though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for advantages, I can tell that it's obviously pretty simple to use. Only hot water and ground coffee is required to operate it, but I'm sure that this process of making a cup of coffee must have some effect on the taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What effect does this have then, does this change the bitterness, dilute the taste? Is the pour-over method superior?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It depends on the press. I personally use a double-walled (which means air-insulated) press with very very fine screens in the plunger. This means my coffee stays hot for quite some time, and I don't commonly have issues with grounds at the bottom of the second cup (it's a 2-cup press). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also spent over $300 for it, hand made in Japan by expert crafters with some beautiful stainless steel hardware framing it. It's actually &lt;em&gt;guaranteed&lt;/em&gt; to resonate at a certain frequency if you wet your finger and run it around the rim. I digress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most presses can have some or all of the following issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grinds leak through the screen on the plunger quite easily, even with a good coarse grind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee can fall below serving temp before you plunge it if you're not careful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are a bit of a pain to clean, most can't go &lt;em&gt;near&lt;/em&gt; a dishwasher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tend to be rather fragile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can stain with certain kinds of water, depending on the glass used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some argue that the taste of a coarse grind is inferior to finer grinds (a matter of taste is difficult to document)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual mechanics of making the coffee is very simple. Mix the grinds and water, then using a screen, separate the grinds from the water. The taste is going to depend more on how clean the press is, the quality and temperature of the water, the quality of the bean, grind, how long you let it brew, etc. The same holds true for pour-over brews, provided that the filter is decent and doesn't add its own taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally prefer my press, but it's really a matter of preference. I don't mind cleaning it, in fact one of the reasons I went with a press a while back was in hopes that the prospect &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; needing to clean it would slow down my consumption. Didn't work.  I love the consistently-good brews I get out of mine, and I love that it keeps my second cup hot long enough for me to enjoy the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; mind the quirks, and prefer not to use them. Something decent usually starts at around $40, so they're not prohibitively expensive for experimentation. All I can say is try both and see what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What coarseness of grind works best for cold brew?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently received &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0009MZ67Q"&gt;a new device&lt;/a&gt; for making cold brew coffee. It put out a really good cold brew. The filter is made out of a fine nylon mesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How coarsely (or finely) should the coffee be ground for best cold-brew extraction?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Two guides do have specific (though differing!) recommendations on coarseness of grind for cold brew. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue Bottle recommends &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/cold-brew" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a grind &lt;strong&gt;a bit finer&lt;/strong&gt; than paper-filtered drip coffee&lt;/a&gt; (they compare it to the same grind as for AeroPress); they're using an immersion setup with a wool filter. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kicking Horse recommends &lt;a href="http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/how-make-cold-brew-coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;medium-coarse&lt;/strong&gt; grind&lt;/a&gt;, nearly like that of French press; they are using a similar setup but claim that a finer grind extracts more bitter compounds. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I use the latter because I find the filtering goes more easily with a coarser grind; see also &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/431/how-can-i-make-filtering-my-cold-brew-easier"&gt;this question about making cold brew easier to filter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/481/whats-the-recommended-coffee-to-water-ratio-for-cold-brew"&gt;This question&lt;/a&gt; also discusses the grind.

  <title>Home Roasting with Fresh Roast SR500</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've just purchased a Fresh Roast SR500 home roaster. I have no experience roasting coffee so I'm looking for some basic principles to guide my efforts. After two batches so far, the first, done according to the directions, was horribly undrinkable, and the second, while drinkable still wasn't very good.  The flavor is a somewhat bitter aftertaste. The coffee is described as a wet processed fruity Java bean. I have so many questions I'm not really sure where to begin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After watching several YouTube videos it seems like every one is different. A professional roasters site advised the roasting time should be between 10 and 15 minutes for all roast levels. But that still leaves the question of how much heat and how to adjust that during the roast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any straightforward principles for how to adjust the roast in respone to the taste I've gotten from my first attempts?  Or any guidance on differences in roasting light vs Full City which would be the darkest I would do?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don't want to reinvent the wheel here and waste a bunch of coffee beans in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There is a goodish guide for your roaster &lt;a href="https://www.sweetmarias.com/pub/media/sebwite/productdownloads//f/r/fresh_roast_tip_sheet_1.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd also keep in mind that coffee has a cooling period after you "stop" roasting, where it will generally still roast to a darker level (or two). You need to try to finish your roast at a level or so lighter than what you are aiming for and let the coffee "cool" into your desired roast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might suggest that you roast at a lower level (lower heat) so that the beans move through the stages more slowly.  This will badly suck up your time, but will also allow you greater chance of stopping the roast at the roast level you are aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that many of the descriptions you read for green coffee are done by people with extremely refined palates.  No matter what coffee you roast, those fruit type descriptions are still hints and notes in the coffee, not it's overall flavor.  Additionally the quality of the green beans you are roasting will affect the final quality of your roast. It's impossible to make poor green beans great by perfectly roasting them.  You can, however, ruin high quality green beans with a poor roast.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started roasting, I was "lucky" enough to start with a cheap air popper.  The advantage of that is that with a popper it is very easy to hear the "cracks" associated with roasting.  My personal opinion is that the "cracks" are one of the few constants with beans that actually consistently indicate roast level. While there are other gauges out there (darkness and smell), they can vary with different varieties of beans.  Eventually I moved to a machine where I couldn't hear the cracking at all, but by then, I had learned enough of the other cues that it didn't matter as much.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What does Kopi Luwak taste like?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have never had the opportunity to try Kopi Luwak, and I'd like to know how it tastes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does its taste differ from more traditionally processed coffee from the same region?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there other coffees with similar tasting notes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware that such a question may be considered opinion-based, but using some sort of external reference, or analysis of its traits, it could receive a more objective answer.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I've had this &lt;em&gt;on the farm where it was harvested&lt;/em&gt;, and was able to verify for myself that wild, happy civets were left to their own selection process and merely followed around by farmers eager to find the drops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not unlike any other Arabica bean. What I had was single-source, but that's rarer - farms doing it &lt;em&gt;correctly&lt;/em&gt; don't produce a lot, so packagers and marketers will usually buy from dozens. That brings me to the first thing that determines the taste of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Roast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some farmers roast themselves, others just sell the beans. Many sell directly to people &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to packagers, so unless you get it single-source, you're probably going to have a bag of beans roasted anywhere from blonde to nearly dark. If you're serious about tasting it, find a place that offers single-source, or roasts their own. You want it &lt;em&gt;just at&lt;/em&gt; the second 'crack'. A comparable color is a Starbucks 'blonde' roast, or the usual color of illy in the red can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Brew&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had it two ways, as espresso and in a press. I &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; to have it in a press, despite not getting nearly as much crema. A coarse grind, hot clean water and about 4 minutes to brew. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink it immediately with a clean palette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Make sure you're not thirsty, make sure you're not hungry, and make sure there's nothing going on with your taste buds other than the coffee. You want to sip slow and enjoy it. Don't let it get cold, but slow down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Taste&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While debates are quite hot regarding whether or not the civet's digestion of the bean adds anything to flavor, I'm quite confident that the selection process &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;. Good Arabica coffee is known for the subtle nutty / caramel hints, and you know it when you drink this. I couldn't detect any difference in acidity, but the flavors that the bean is known are definitely more present than usual. This makes a lot of sense given the selection process, civets are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; picky cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, that's not to say that a very discriminating and trained picker couldn't get you something close. In fact, illy (red) comes &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; close to the same quality and presence of flavor undertones that I've experienced with alamid (kopi luwak).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't raise your expectations &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; high, it's not really &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much better than any other very high quality Arabica. You're paying for the process (make sure you're dealing with an 'honest' source) as much as you are the quality of bean, novelty and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It tastes very good, but so do the illy beans I grind every day.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does it make a difference whether the moka lid is open or not?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When brewing coffee with a moka pot, I often leave the lid open so I can better tell when the coffee is ready. Is having the lid off affecting the brewing process in any significant way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine leaving the lid on will cause the water to heat up faster as the hot air inside the chamber cannot escape as easily, and I wonder if this affects the flavour or general coffee experience.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;So what I've been taught is that you should keep the lid open while brewing. This is so you can watch the progress of the extraction, and cut the heat at the appropriate time. It gives you much more control over your brew this way - for example, I cut the heat (and run the base under the cold tap for larger pots) as soon as I see the coffee running from the spout turn lighter, rather than waiting for the gurgle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as for lid open/closed during brewing, I don't imagine this has any effect on the extraction. The amount of heat lost will be tiny in comparison to other variables.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What gives Turkish coffee that unique "quality"?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering what makes Turkish coffee made out of original Turkish packed ground coffee taste so differently (better) from what I can do from beans that I grind myself or in the shop, following basically the same technology?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a few hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's all has to do with right &lt;em&gt;Cezve&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. pot. However, buying
'true' Turkish coffee pot didn't help. Actually I get much better
results with Turkish ground coffee comparing to the one sold
by weight even if the latter costs more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They add cardamom to the coffee. I tried it, coffee tastes better, but
it's still not the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They grind it very very finely. I asked the seller to grind my&lt;br /&gt;
coffee as fine as they can but the result is still poor. (Actually this
is still an open question, because they can use better machines than the ones I have access to.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They use special coffee mixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in Wikipedia I read that it is mostly about fineness of the grinding, but burr mill and mortar proposed there didn't work in my case. I also bought a turkish coffee mill like this:
&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3JaVQ.jpg" alt="Coffee mill" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to grind the coffee with this mill many times, results are always poor. Does anybody know what is the secret? Can I make my own coffee that would be the same quality (or better) than, say, &lt;em&gt;Mehmet Efendi&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Assuming that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have found the &lt;strong&gt;best available beans in your market&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which are then &lt;strong&gt;finely ground&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;used instantly after the grinding&lt;/strong&gt; (have in mind the finer the grinding the faster the coffee taste deteriorates as it both absorbs humidity and all smells from the environment with it and in the same time releases its aroma).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;right Cezve&lt;/strong&gt; : the pot shouldn't be a steel, as the temperature rises very fast which leads to bitter/ burnt taste. The preferred material is copper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;right preparation methods&lt;/strong&gt; : make it as slower as possible and wait for it to create a thick cream (caimác) that will protect its aroma as in espresso. To achieve that you can use either direct flame (as you can directly see the flame and control the amount of heat transfered):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/78CyA.png" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;
&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i5Zcw.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or sand (which has large heat capacity and it takes a lot of time to get hot):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p9qWV.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;steer it frequently till it boils&lt;/strong&gt;: to homogenize it perfectly; otherwise the coffee and sugar go down on the bottom and melt/ burn and deteriorate the taste.&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>How long can I store roasted coffee beans?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;How long do they retain their qualities? In the coffee store near my home the seller told me that their coffee beans are stored for 1-3 months in their shop. But after purchase I'm also storing them for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I assume you are storing them for a later grinding (likely just before preparing your cups of coffee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to some sources &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncausa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=70"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5239098/the-coffee-geeks-guide-to-storing-beans"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2009/05/for-better-coffee-store-your-beans/16690/"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the main point is &lt;strong&gt;use it within a week&lt;/strong&gt;. For more than that, it is preferable to freeze them, and in this condition, for no more than a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For short term use (this week's coffee):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not refrigerate your daily supply of coffee (in order to avoid moisture).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep them in air-tight glass or ceramic containers, in a dark and cool place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep only the amount of beans you know you will quickly use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For long term use (no more than a month):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a large amount of beans, wrap them in small (weekly) amounts inside air-tight bags, and freeze them. Once removed from freezer, do not return them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are making coffee in an espresso machine, let them getting room temperature for one day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  <title>Milk in place of water</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What would happen if one were to substitute milk in place of water for the following brewing methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percolating/Moka pot; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pour over; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aeropress; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;French Press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would it extract anything from the coffee grounds? Would it create something passable?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attempt 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first attempt, I brewed it exactly like I brew my normal (water-based) coffee. I used a French Press with a light/medium roast, heating the milk in Pyrex in a microwave. The milk heated unevenly, curdling in places. Luckily, the curdled bits stuck to the Pyrex and I was able to make a passable cup. The thickness of the milk meant that it didn't want to pass through the mesh when pouring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predominant flavor was that of the milk. I could barely tell it was coffee, though it definitely absorbed &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; flavor. The texture was about what you'd expect--&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; smooth and rich. It was the kind of drink that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attempt 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my first attempt, I learned that milk is able to absorb and mask coffee's flavor incredibly well (after all, it's what people use to tone down overly strong coffee). This time, I heated the milk in a saucepan over low heat, stirring frequently (a rather long and annoying process for a single cup of coffee). I probably could have gotten it a bit hotter, but it worked well enough. I nearly doubled the amount of grounds and brew time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, it came out with a distinct coffee smell, and about the same texture. Again, the initial flavor was that of the milk, but it had a smooth, subtle, and quite pleasant coffee aftertaste. I never got that bad taste you sometimes get a while after a normal cup of coffee--instead, the residual flavor was like you had just taken a sip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't want milk-brewed coffee for my morning cup. It feels more like a drinkable dessert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone else wants to try this, I recommend using some stronger/darker coffee. I didn't have any dark roast on hand, or I would have tried it. Give it time to brew--more than you would with water. Be patient when heating the milk, or you'll end up curdling it and ruining the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could probably work as a dessert drink if brewed with some spices in addition to the coffee. If nothing else, I'd say it looks pretty cool as you can see in the attached image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried this again today with espresso coffee (Cafe Bustelo), and it turned out great. The end result was like a latte but more... dull, or smooth. I don't know how exactly to compare it. Espresso grind is definitely the right choice when brewing with milk--it's the only thing strong enough and with the right flavor profile to stand out in the milk and complement the milk's flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be warned, though, that the fine grind of espresso coffee means you will need to use a paper filter at some point along the way. Sticking a paper filter in a French Press doesn't work because of how resistant the milk is to going through the filter. It seems to jet around the sides, allowing the espresso to slip through.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How should I store ground coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1/19"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;, which seeks the optimal method for storing whole beans. In that same vein, I'd like to know the best way to store ground coffee to preserve freshness. Should ambient temperature and humidity be considered?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In general, it's best to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; store ground coffee. If quality really matters, then the real answer is to back up. Try to grind only enough coffee for what you're using immediately to brew with. If you're buying preground coffee, then storage and optimal quality become somewhat trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the surface area of the coffee is increased (by grinding it), the majority of the coffee is exposed to air, accelerates the decomposition of the coffee, meaning it likely isn't going to stay fresh for long anyway. Think of it like opening a dry, red wine. Since it's been opened, it's going to turn faster than it being left in the bottle because it's been exposed to atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, if flavor and freshness really matter, try not to &lt;em&gt;store&lt;/em&gt; ground coffee if at all possible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; store ground coffee, keep it sealed airtight. The exposure to atmosphere is going to be the strongest catalyst in making your coffee less than fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How does coffee grind size affect coffee taste</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a grinding machine with a lot of different settings. Even between the categories of Fine and Medium there are sub levels of grinding. I'm not sure how they relate to the flavor of the coffee. Is there any research that shows how the grind affects the taste of the different types of roasts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lsio9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The main reason for different grinds is the different brewing processes. If the water is exposed to the grounds for a very short amount of time (e.g., 10-15 seconds for espresso), you need a finer grind to provide enough surface area to extract the coffee from the beans. If the brewing time is long (e.g., the ~4 minutes of french press), you need a coarse grind to avoid over-extracting the grounds and getting something too bitter to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's really the heart of it. If the grind is too coarse for your brewing method, your coffee will end up under-extracted, weak, and acidic. If it is too fine a grind, your coffee ends up over-extracted and bitter. Your grinder is a good brand; if you still have the manual, it includes a guide to grind vs. brewing method. If not, the capresso.com site includes PDF versions.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Generating crema with a moka pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a stove top percolator for making espresso.  It does not generate any crema.  it possible to do so with a stove top percolator? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Moka pots (or stove top percolators) usually produce a pressure of around 1.5 bar, while most coffees require a pressure of at least around 6 bar for a crema to appear. However, there are some Moka pots with a special valve (called Cremator) which helps creating more pressures and thus produce a crema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, a &lt;em&gt;real Espresso&lt;/em&gt; has to be brewed with a pressure of 9 bar ± 1, according to the &lt;a href="http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf"&gt;Italian National Espresso Institute&lt;/a&gt;, so it can't be brewed with a Moka pot.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I regularly use a moka pot for making coffee, and I've heard different people tell me about cleaning it. The consensus does seem to be that I should never clean it with soap, just rinse it with warm/hot water, but some people insist that it should never be cleaned! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should my moka pot cleaning routine be?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you stop washing your mocha pot completely, you'll see a bit of a residue buildup  on the inside of the pot from many past cuppas imparting their special oils to surface. This "seasoning" is said to protect the brew from any off flavors that might be imparted by the bare metal of the pot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether this effect can be quantified by a perceptible difference in taste, I see no reason to part with tradition; it is a badge of honor and the sign of a well-used pot. At the very least, you are saving yourself a lot of trouble in having to clean it out each time. You can certainly clean the &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; with an appropriate cleaner if the patina isn't to your liking, but I would just rinse the inside with hot water. Liquid detergents have a way of imparting their own taste, and dishwashers will can quickly oxidize aluminum pots like the Bialetti.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why do some people sneer at Starbucks coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Business practices aside, Starbucks coffee seems to get a lot of derision from people who consider themselves coffee aficionados. Why is this? I can understand why one might not like the idea of an enormous creamy, iced, syrup-filled beverage, but is there anything wrong with their actual espresso?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of this common mindset is presented on &lt;a href="http://ideas.time.com/2012/09/19/the-perils-of-coffee-snobbery/"&gt;Time.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[...] no coffee snob I know would be caught dead drinking a latte, especially the Starbucks latte they implied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In order to maintain consistency, Starbucks roasts their coffee a &lt;em&gt;tad&lt;/em&gt; bit longer than many might prefer. The espresso you get in New York is going to taste exactly like the one you got in Hong Kong, or New Delhi - that's actually kind of impressive. Still, if you're someone that likes their beans just past the second 'crack' - you might find their espresso a bit too dark, a bit too bitter and a bit too expensive to be accepting of a disappointment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the coffee that they sell &lt;em&gt;in bags&lt;/em&gt; gives you plenty of options - you can still get a nice blonde-roasted bag of single source Arabica at many locations. If you're there to order something with milk in it, then you're probably not going to notice just how dark the beans really taste - you'll probably just enjoy your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you tend to take espresso straight, or a drink that is basically espresso cut with water or very little milk, you might thumb your nose in the air a bit. Then again, I'd take a bitter-ish espresso over a cup of bland-ish drip any day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People love to complain if given the opportunity. If you like their espresso, enjoy it - if not, well, drink other espresso :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What constituant in coffee has a laxative effect?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My question is as simple as it sounds. I want to know &lt;strong&gt;which constituent in coffee makes me poop, chemical or physical (particle)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure everyone has experienced it. You drink a (couple) cup(s) of coffee and a few minutes later you'll find yourself rushing to the toilet.
I personally don't drink a lot of coffee. I drink one cup a day (only from We. to Fr.) and occasionally a cup on Weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What ingredient causes this laxative effect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it the caffeine?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If so, why doesn't energy drinks have a similar effect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it something out of the coffee bean itself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do only special types of coffee (bean) have this laxative effect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried googling a bit, but haven't found a meaningful answer. Seems like scientists can't agree which ingredient causes it or whether it's even scientifically proven that coffee has a laxative effect.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, nor do I play one on TV...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would guess that it is a combination of a few factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee contains caffeine which is a stimulant and most stimulants have some degree of laxative effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If nothing else stimulants will raise your metabolism, so even if it isn't immediate you'll be heading to the bathroom sooner than you would without them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also looks like caffeine causes stimulation of the bowels specifically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;coffee can also cause looser stools because increased peristalsis
  leaves less time for the colon to perform one of its key
  functions–reabsorbing water from fecal matter to produce well-formed
  stools. Be aware, however, that other common accompaniments to coffee
  can be culprits in this matter. Dairy products, excess sugar, even
  “sugarless” sweeteners like sorbitol (a well-known substance used as a
  laxative) can cause diarrhea. &lt;a href="http://www.onemedical.com/blog/eat-well/why-coffee-makes-me-poop/"&gt;- Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee is mostly water  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just drinking a couple full glasses of water on an empty stomach can lead to a softer stool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psychological effect  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't know if there have been any real studies on this, but I strongly suspect that there is some &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"&gt;Classical Conditioning&lt;/a&gt; going on. Much like Pavlov's dogs who were conditioned to salivate at the sound of a bell, if your usual morning routine is to have a cup of coffee and then head to the restroom, over time you end up conditioning your self to do this regardless of whether or not the coffee is really "making you poop". &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steps seem to be as follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your latte as normal, heating/frothing the milk as you normally would - a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfoam"&gt;microfoam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a &lt;em&gt;separate&lt;/em&gt; batch of frothed milk, and froth it a lot - you want a really stiff foam - a &lt;em&gt;macrofoam&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spoon the stiff foam carefully onto the top of your latte. If you've got it right, the dollops should just sit there and retain their shape. Keep spooning it on to build the shape you want. For your linked images, this is obviously quite a lot of dollops of various sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a paintbrush to paint the darker areas onto the foam with espresso. It looks like your example has a variety of colours. This is probably done with food dye and/or chocolate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy destroying your painstakingly produced work of art for the sake of your next caffeine fix!&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Coffee in Breaking Bad</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There's a part of the popular Breaking Bad TV show where they discuss making very good coffee in an advanced drug laboratory.  They mention a specific temperature and you can see some apparatus.  Does anyone here know how accurate that segment of the show is, and whether there is a specific optimum process for making coffee which would ensure perfect coffee, even if it's not something you'd necessarily be able to reproduce at home?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;All coffee preparations can be improved with an application of science! Simply by monitoring and carefully controlling conditions such as water temperature, brew-time, grind etc., you can improve the taste of your coffee. No doubt with the array of instruments available to them in Breaking Bad they could have done a fine job of this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the aparatus, &lt;a href="https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/7439/chemistry-behind-gales-coffee-maker-in-breaking-bad"&gt;this Chemistry Stack Exchange answer&lt;/a&gt; goes into a lot of detail. It seems a vacuum pump is being used to boil the water at a lower temperature than otherwise. This setup might be a bit beyond what non-chemists are able to construct though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to pretend you're in Breaking Bad while making your cup of coffee &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; a PhD in Chemistry, the closest you're going to get is with a &lt;a href="http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chemex flask&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jLIQR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's basically pour-over drip coffee, albeit with proprietary, thicker filters that change the taste of the coffee (by removing more of the oils).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much does keeping beans vacuum sealed matter?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I use a moka pot (makineta) to make coffee, and I keep the beans in a bag (not sealed) in the freezer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep getting people saying that in order to get to best aroma and the most fresh coffee the beans must be kept in vacuum after roasting until use, and due to this fact there is no escape but using the sealed Nespresso capsules and their machine (or any other capsule espresso machine equivalent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much does it matter? How much of the aroma/freshness is lost if the beans are not kept in vacuum? (but are being ground only prior to making a cup)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coffee beans are freshest from about 12 to 48 hours after roasting until maybe one or two weeks later when stored properly in an airtight container.  During the early portion of this period (immediately after roasting to three or four days later) beans will be still giving off some gases, thus the reason for one way valves on coffee bags.  That being the case, vaccuum sealing can extend that time some, but not indefinitely.  Storing your coffee in the freezer actually makes the problem worse since the freeze thaw cycle drys the beans out and forces the oils to separate out of the beans.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What variables in brewing have the biggest effect on taste?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been brewing my coffee with an AeroPress for a couple of years now and I've become aware of the huge number of variables available to me in making my morning Java.  Assuming the same bean and roast level, I see &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;amount of ground coffee, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grind coarsness,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;temperature of the water,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;steep time, and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using the AeroPress right side up or upside down, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as the variables I can play with to vary the taste.  Some of these variables may offset each other as well.  For example would steeping coarser ground coffee result in the same taste as less time steeping a finer grind?  Or how about coarser ground coffee in hotter water v. finer ground at lower temperature?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm searching for the key variables in my control to play with to maximize the effect on taste.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A few other factors to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freshly ground beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How you store your coffee beans. You basically want to keep them reasonably cool and away from oxygen, sunlight, moisture and variations in temperature (which is why you don't keep them in the freezer except for long term storage). Generally in the pantry in an opaque, air-tight container. I one-way valve is recommended as recently roasted beans will emit CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. I bought a stack of &lt;a href="http://fivesenses.com.au/shop/associated/250g-empty-bags"&gt;250g resealable foil bags with the one-way valve&lt;/a&gt; from a local roaster and would use each bag a few times. These days I use &lt;a href="http://planetarydesign.com/products/airscape-kitchen-canisters/"&gt;AirScape canisters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131017143359/http://dailyshotofcoffee.com/great-coffee-starts-with-the-right-water/"&gt;The water you use.&lt;/a&gt; If you wouldn't enjoy drinking your tap water, don't use it to brew coffee. Use the same water you use for drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of water you put in the Aeropress vs. the amount of water and/or milk you add afterwards (if any).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How vigorously you stir with the paddle. Generally you want to stir just enough to ensure all the grounds are thoroughly wetted, and that there are no air pockets. Stirring too much can over-extract which will increase the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pressing into the cup, do you only press until you hear the air hissing through, or do you keep going and compress the puck, squeezing out every bit of water you can?[1] The latter can over-extract and increase bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using paper filters vs. a metal disc filter. Also, some people believe pre-rinsing a paper filter makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are a lot of variables, and people can become amazingly pedantic. Fun if you don't mind a bit of experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to water temperature, the general wisdom is that you want the slurry of coffee and water to brew at around 95&amp;deg;C, which is just a bit under boiling for optimal extraction. &lt;a href="http://www.tested.com/food/coffee/455840-how-important-coffee-brew-water-temperature/"&gt;This video&lt;/a&gt; gives some pretty good advice on this. Pre-heating the Aeropress would probably make the biggest difference here[2]. I usually just wait until the water in the kettle stops bubbling before pouring. Apparently it is possible to burn the grounds if you hit them with water that is boiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other bugbear I have is with retention in coffee grinders. Retention is when grounds are left up in the works of the grinder, and often the grounds can come out very staticy and cling to everything and make a mess. This grosses me out as it means old grounds from previous grinding will be dropped in with the fresh grind. Weighing the beans before and after can show a variation of half a gram or more. Urk.[3] However I've found that sprinkling a couple of drops of water on the beans before grinding almost completely eliminates retention for me.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] There's a term for over-squeezing the grounds that escapes me at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] Having lived a lot of my life in drought areas, using and then discarding the water to pre-heat my Aeropress or French press is something I find surprisingly hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3] I did mention people can become amazingly pedantic, didn't I?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the optimal brewing technique for extracting caffeine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering what process, or processes, would yield the highest caffeine quantity at a fixed drink size (Say 200ml).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming the same variety of bean, same roast, same quantity, same water temperature and same extraction time. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think the answer to your question is generally going to be espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brewing process all comes down to pressure, temperature, extraction time (water contact time), possibly agitation and filtering. I may be missing a variable, but all the methods of brewing are just mixing of those variables. If you fix all but one variable, you'd have an answer for any given equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these things are ultimately affecting the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility" rel="nofollow"&gt;solubility&lt;/a&gt; of the caffeine in the coffee.  Since espresso is one of the few brewing methods to affect pressure (and generally uses the greatest pressure) it's going to be the winner.  &lt;a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-40422008000600009&amp;amp;script=sci_arttext" rel="nofollow"&gt;Increased pressure means increased caffeine solubility.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From wikipedia you'll note the two major factors affecting solubility are temperature and pressure.  You'll also note that dissolution doesn't always happen instantly; rates may vary based on conditions.  By increasing pressure during brewing my guess is that the rate of caffeine dissolution is increased.  making it more efficient for short brewing times.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does the bloom matter in French Press?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am a fan of pour-over, generally speaking, and I understand the importance of wetting the grounds, then allowing them to "bloom" for &lt;del&gt;45&lt;/del&gt; 30 seconds or so before beginning the extraction. The main purpose of this is to allow carbon dioxide and other gasses to escape from the grounds, so they can extract more evenly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a coworker who is a fan of French Press, and he does a bloom in the French Press as well. I'm curious if this matters as much in this context, since the grounds are completely submerged the whole time. Is it important? If so, is it for the same reason or some other reason as a pour-over?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I believe there is mysticism to blooming. Don't get me wrong, I feel its important, but I don't think it does all the things that people claim it does. Blooming is important when using fresh roasted beans(and you should be). Blooming simply aids in removing CO2 from the grounds, which would otherwise create negative space between your grounds and the water. It's simply used to provide a more even extraction. Blooming is important in any immersion brewing, and can even aid in pour-over methods as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also reduce your brew time slightly to compensate for the extraction that takes place during the bloom. I'd typically bloom for 30 seconds, then push the bloom down gently without agitation(agitation effect solubility).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think its a dubious claim to state that the bloom does anything beyond removing the CO2, thus providing a more even extraction. It would really depend on how you perform your bloom. Do you bloom then start your timer? Do you bloom with a small amount of water first, then add more to prevent too much extraction during the bloom? Ultimately these differences in taste don't have anything to do with the bloom itself, but more so the extraction time brought on by how you perform your bloom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bloom itself does not effect taste, and it is an important part of using a french press, as its key to providing even extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I stay off coffee after I quit?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have quit drinking coffee many times, and it was never that difficult for me to do, but can never stay quit for more than about 3 or 4 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I typically drink 3, homebrewed cups a day, and only put a small amount of half &amp;amp; half in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been drinking coffee for over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main problem here is that I don't feel quite right after I quit. This feeling does not seem to go away, so I always start again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I stay off coffee after I quit? And would I ever normalize, if so, how many weeks might it take?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I kicked it by switching to caffeine pills so that I could carefully taper down. Before I started the process, though, I went to caffeineinformer to get a good estimate of my daily habit. I then used caffeine pills to replace the milligrams of caffeine I was having as coffee. From there, I began to cut the pills into quarters and slowly reduce my intake over the course of several months. Each Saturday I would step down by one quarter of a pill. Withdrawal was minimal and by Monday I was back able to work. It took discipline and patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One unintended, but huge benefit that I found by going this route is that I disassociated the buzz with the ritual and smell of coffee. It became clinical for me. Plus it was quite easy to control &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; I took my caffeine. I no longer had to make or find coffee to get my fix.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What do producers usually mix ground coffee with to make it cheaper?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I will not go into details, or reasons (political, economic, logistic or otherwise), but in my country, coffee has been scarce and expensive in the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been suspecting that some coffee producers have been cutting it (mixing it) with cheaper things. The unmistakable aroma of coffee is now mixed with some bitter tones sometimes, fishy tones some other times. The flavor is not quite coffee also.  It's been so long since I've smelled the unmistakable aroma of real,  honest to God coffee. I'm almost 100% convinced that they are mixing it with roasted black beans or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions is, what other grains, nuts or whatever do coffee produces  usually mix ground coffee with in order to make it cheaper? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I check whether or not the ground coffee has been mixed up?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go into any political discussion, theory or similar, but I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; give you a few historical facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have always been times in the last few centuries when coffee was a rare commodity. And it has always been expensive to some degree, making it "something for special occasions" in the poorer parts of European societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People used and still use various "&lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_substitute"&gt;substitutes&lt;/a&gt;" from grains (barley, spelt, rice), roots (chiccory, dandelion), fruit (acorns, dates), typically roasted, ground and prepared like coffee beans, resulting in a somewhat bitter, dark drink more or less resembling genuine coffee. (For a more extensive list, see the link above.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of replacing coffee, they can also be mixed with coffee, "stretching" the yield of the coffee beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to check your coffee for "fillers", buy whole beans - none of the coffee substitutes look even remotely like coffee beans.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to properly use the Bialetti Brikka</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The Brikka, like many stovetop espresso makers, has a lot of parameters that affect how the espresso turns out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the best parameters for using the Brikka correctly? Which of these are more vital to getting the crema to stick around once you pour the espresso into the cup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current list is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground coffee particle size&lt;/strong&gt; (compared to espresso machine fine or coarser)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amount of water&lt;/strong&gt; filled in the bottom part&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amount of coffee&lt;/strong&gt; you put in the basket and compression - this one is supposed to be easy, fill it up without a hump and without pressing it down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fire size and strength&lt;/strong&gt; under the Brikka - I use the smallest flame base, but using the smallish 2-cup Brikka it is a bit bigger than the base when on maximal burn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When exactly to turn off the fire&lt;/strong&gt; under the Brikka&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When exactly to pour the coffee&lt;/strong&gt; (it says right after the coffee comes out, but there is coffee still coming out of the nozzle if I pour it too soon).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I understand that the crema created by the Brikka is an approximated crema using the gasket's small opening. Sure, purists may not consider this tan, smooth film of microbubbles as authentic crema (akin to espresso makers), but it does do a good job creating it for a close mouthfeel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use my Brikka every day, and it creates the "Brikkrema" (as I'd like to call it) just fine [see the photo].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you aren't achieving proper results, it could be the water, or the bean you're using. I've had instances where some beans wouldn't generate a great crema, as compared to other varieties. Factors could be the age, the containers their kept in, and all basically relating to the oils and the CO2 trapped in the bean shortly after roasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZMwyy.jpg" alt="My Bialetti Brikka brewing..."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5c8LP.jpg" alt="...Post-brewing"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wlrGk.jpg" alt="The first pour also generates the greatest amount of Brikkrema"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cSfbH.jpg" alt="Subsequent pours also lessen the crema generated, as seen here... so try lessening the water amount a until you get a good mix of factors"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last photo shows a comparison between pours. The first pour (left) often providing the most crema from a brew, while the subsequent pours (right) may not have as much. It helps to spread the first pour over each shot if you have more than one shot to serve, and then pour the rest of the coffee along the side of the cup as not to disturb the cream on top. Sometimes, a brand new Brikka needs 3-4 brews before it begins creating its magic. But even so, if you aren't achieving your preferred result, try these tips: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to lessen the water below the water line

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start with a shot's worth of water then see what you get, then just increase to get a proportion you're happy with).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try filtered water

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you'd be surprised how big a difference water quality can make.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the bean you're using, until you get your desired results. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some beans offer varying levels of crema, whether it's because of the CO2 content from the roast or just the overall nature of the bean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck! And don't worry, at the end of the day it boils (or brews) down to personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;

I use a camping stove temporarily, but it requires me to buy gas refills every now and then. Is there an easier way?&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes, you just need to get a pot that's made of the right stuff. Induction hobs only work with magnetic metals. If you can stick a magnet to your coffee pot, it will work. Traditional moka pots are made of aluminium, which is why they don't.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How does pressure affect the flavor of espresso?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've noticed the water pressure from espresso machines varies from about 12 psi to 22 psi. What effect does this have on flavor? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Working on a Synesso (prototype), I was lucky enough to be able to play with controlled pre-infusion. &lt;a href="http://www.fivesenses.com.au/blog/2014/06/19/pressure-profiling-using-the-synesso-hydra" rel="nofollow"&gt;They state&lt;/a&gt; that their pre-infusion has a pressure of 3-4 bars and " bring[s] an extra textural element to your brew in the form of a greater volume of crema. It can also lead to a more syrupy mouth-feel overall." I find this to be mostly true if the pre-infusion was used for about 5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found through personal experience was that, if I kept the pressure consistent, not switching to the full 9 bars, the shot pulled at the same extraction rate, finishing at my desired time. So Keeping dose, time, and extraction the same, the only variable was pressure. I found that the most notable change was a &lt;em&gt;reduction in brightness.&lt;/em&gt; The more pronounced acidity and citric flavors were &lt;em&gt;dulled&lt;/em&gt;. There was however a silver-lining that gave the pre-infusion a redeeming quality: Because of the reduction in brightness, I found that when using &lt;em&gt;really fresh&lt;/em&gt; coffee ( &amp;lt; 4 days old), the pre-infusions reduction in brightness took away from the character metallic taste found with fresh coffee. For that reason, when I am dealing with fresh coffee, I may increase the pre-infusion time (from 5 to 9 seconds for example) and this helps make the espresso palatable. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How should I store my aeropress?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've heard that storing an Aeropress with the plunger inside the main cylinder will eventually damage the plunger, because the rubber is stored compressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any truth to this? What's the best way to store an aeropress?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;According to the Aeropress manual:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Remove the cap and set it aside.  Push the plunger to eject the "puck"
  of spent grounds into the trash.  Rinse and/or brush away any grounds
  left on the rubber seal.  The seal has already wiped your chamber
  clean, so no further cleanup is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Always eject the puck right after brewing, and &lt;em&gt;store your Aeropress
  with the plunger pushed all the way through or completely removed. 
  Storing the seal uncompressed will keep your seal airtight for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is mentioned he found them too bitter at the time. But is it &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to eat them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, according &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea#Ecology"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;"The caffeine in coffee "beans" is a natural plant defense against herbivory, i.e., a toxic substance that protects the seeds of the plant."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But clearly that does not poison us humans. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR&lt;/em&gt; Yes, they are edible and non-toxic to humans.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee cherries, as they are properly called, are a thin papery skin and attached mucilage (what we think of as the flesh of the fruit). Coffee cherries are consumed as a drink, cascara, by coffee farmers in Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee cherries contain more caffeine than coffee, on average, as they do not go though a roasting process. Depending on the green processing / pulping / milling process the coffee went through, coffee cherries often have a bitter and gamy flavor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to plant, harvest, process and roast my own coffee, would I be able to actually do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have my own garden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obtaining coffe plant to actually plant it would be a challenge, but not impossible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could plant it in my own greenhouse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously, I do not plan to sell it for business, just for my own purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, theoretically: Am I able to actually produce me coffee in "drinkable" quality? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I suppose you can if you can first make a decent coffee plant(s) to first make the coffee. Using this &lt;a href="http://www.thanksgivingcoffee.com/blog/?p=174" rel="nofollow"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; can help you with your gardening/farming of coffee plants. It is mainly based in the USA so sorry! Some tips to notice for decent coffee beans:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't put coffee plants in direct sunlight for too long. It will kill your plant and ruin your life. Most coffee plants need little sunlight to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes 10 minutes of frost/3 hours of direct sunlight outside from May and November will kill it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Place it near or at the east-facing window to get a good morning sun and just enough sunlight from the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use warm water but don't flood the pots with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the drinkable coffee will the hard part I guess. Here is a seemingly a good website for roasting at home: &lt;a href="http://www.breworganic.com/coffee/howtoroast.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Roasting at Home&lt;/a&gt;. Remember to use green, unroasted coffee beans!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Procedure for making a Caffe Americano</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When making a Caffe Americano, does it matter whether you put the hot water or espresso in first?  This is not a complicated drink to make, but I've seen it prepared both ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it does matter, why does the order affect the taste of the coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes.  Adding water to Espresso is considered an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_Americano"&gt;Americano&lt;/a&gt;.  Doing it the other way around is called a Long Black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to that article and below sources, the Long Black preserves the crema, whereas the Americano preparation should not.  The manner in which the pour is done can contribute more to preserving or destroying the crema than the order.  An Americano should have no crema and the crema should be preserved in a Long Black.  It is the preservation or destruction of the crema that will affect the taste (and thus the pour) more than the order.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does heating milk influence taste?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When I make coffee in a Cezve, I like to preheat milk. I have an impression that it affects taste beyond just not making the resulting drink colder. It seems that the resulting flavour is fuller-bodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing, I like to pour coffee over milk, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my question is, can there be something behind this, or is it just subjective delusions?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes, heating milk does have a perceptible effect on its taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That slightly sweet richness we perceive in milk is largely due to &lt;em&gt;lactose.&lt;/em&gt; Lactose is the "milk sugar" which is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaccharide" rel="nofollow"&gt;disaccharide&lt;/a&gt; of glucose and galactose in solution in the milk. But lactose is also less soluble than sucrose (common table sugar) so it is perceived as &lt;em&gt;less sweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By increasing the temperature of the milk, you are increasing the solubility of the milk sugars which also increases its perceived sweetness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were &lt;em&gt;steaming&lt;/em&gt; the milk (common with lattes and cappuccinos), you would also be incorporating air to create a thicker, creamier consistency, which brings into play the fats and the proteins in the milk, all which play a part in the perceived richness of the beverage. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to preserve crema when pouring a shot into a drink?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;To make a long black, you pour espresso &lt;em&gt;on top of&lt;/em&gt; hot water. There are a variety of reasons for this, but a primary one is to avoid dissipating crema by pouring hot water over it (which is an americano).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do you preserve the crema when pouring it into the water? To me, the act of pouring appears to break the up crema entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This link from &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/29410/is-there-a-method-to-pour-espresso-shots-without-damaging-the-crema"&gt;Seasoned Advice&lt;/a&gt; might help you. The accepted answer recommends to use an espresso brew pitcher and how to use it. The answer suggests two main things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a vessel with a pour spout helps with retaining the crema;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the speed of the pour is important.&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Can decaf coffee be addictive?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;It is evident that decaffeinated coffee &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/204/179"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;still contains a very low amount of caffeine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm interested in is that if decaf coffee still contains some very low amounts of caffeine, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine_dependence" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;caffeine is addictive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, therefore: &lt;strong&gt;is decaf coffee addictive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;? I'm not talking about the 'habitual' dependence. I.e. the &lt;strong&gt;routine&lt;/strong&gt; of drinking the same cup of decaf coffee everyday, but rather the 'physical' or chemical dependence.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Since decaf coffee isn't the same as caffeine-free coffee, the key point regarding addiction is the amount of daily servings of decaf coffee that deliver the 100 milligrams of caffeine needed to acquire some sort of dependence &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0119_050119_ngm_caffeine.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of such cups of decaf will vary according to the brand chosen. According to a study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Analytical Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;, and cited in the article &lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/20061011/decaf-coffee-isnt-caffeine-free" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Decaf coffee isn't caffeine free&lt;/a&gt;, they say that in average, a cup of decaf can hold about one-twentieth of the caffeine you get in a normal drip brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that same article, they state that drinking more cups of decaf can compensate the lack of caffeine, and still be able to produce addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it is indeed a matter of how many cups of decaf you drink.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does coffee taste better out of ceramic cups compared to a paper cup?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I usually drink double espressos and they always seem to taste much better out of a ceramic cup compared to take-away paper cups. I ordered 2 back to back from the same shop within half an hour yesterday, one in a ceramic cup and one to go (I have a coffee drinking problem...) and the difference was still there - so same barista, machine, beans etc. Why is this? For sushi you are told not to eat it with a metal fork since it will supposedly taint the taste, so could this be similar?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;strong&gt;cup material&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;temperature&lt;/strong&gt; are in play here, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big part of the coffee taste (and experience as a whole) is the aroma. I personally find that &lt;strong&gt;paper cups (not surprisingly) &lt;em&gt;smell and taste like paper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Ceramic (or glass, porcelain, etc.) should be practically neutral. Any smell you get from the cup could affect the perception of taste of the contained beverage. If the cup has a plastic lid, that could contribute both to its own smell, or holding-in / reducing the coffee aroma that you smell, also. (Aside: there are some interesting links to the physiology of smell and taste interplay at the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"&gt;Wikipedia article on taste&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The very experience of drinking from a paper cup versus a ceramic cup is different&lt;/strong&gt;; heft, shape, handle, other aesthetics, etc., though this probably reduces to personal preference.  For example, I find sometimes that my lip sticks to the outside of the paper cup, which is unpleasant (to me, anyway :). A plastic lid could be a factor here as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temperature may also be a factor. For example, &lt;a href="http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science/Food-temperature-affects-taste-reveal-scientists"&gt;temperature can affect the perception of bitterness&lt;/a&gt;. A properly pre-heated ceramic cup/demitasse will help the brewed coffee be at a consistent temperature (without shocking it after pull) and keep it warmer for longer (so it doesn't cool down too quickly). Such temperature changes could result in a difference in taste; &lt;strong&gt;keeping brewed coffee at a consistent temperature is recommended&lt;/strong&gt; -- &lt;a href="http://www.thecoffeefaq.com/1thebasics.html"&gt;that and some other general properties are listed here&lt;/a&gt;. Temperature stability of the brew will probably be different between paper and ceramic.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I make that frothy milk that coffee shops use to make lattes?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What are my options for milk frothing? From what I can tell, baristas just use part of the "big coffee machine" (please excuse my rookie terminology; my national drink is tea :D) and don't have a separate device for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm only an occasional coffee drinker, so I don't want to invest in something that costs $100 just to froth milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full answer with all the possible answers ranging from perfect but expensive to inferior but cheap would be best.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;They aren't &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; frothing the milk, they're also &lt;em&gt;stretching&lt;/em&gt; the milk. Stretching it is what gives a latte its unique texture (though the micro bubbles add to that). If you want a good latte, focus first on stretching it - you can use a small whisk to get air into the milk if need be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want a small stainless steel pitcher, most look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bnlis.jpg" alt="pitcher"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put 2/3 of the amount of &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; milk you actually want in your latte in that, then put it on a heat source (small burner is okay). Hold your hand around the pitcher while it heats, and use the other hand to stir the milk. You can also use one hand and just swirl the milk around in the pitcher - do what feels comfortable, just keep the milk moving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the pitcher becomes &lt;em&gt;just less&lt;/em&gt; than too hot for your hand, pull it. Swirl it around a little bit and look inside. Does the milk have a kind of gloss to it similar to Elmer's glue (or any other paste you used in school)? If not, Put it back on the heat for 20 - 30 seconds, swirling it as you do. Once it's got that gloss, and the milk has expanded a bit, it's stretched properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An electric burner is ideal for this, but there are also metal overlays for gas burners that just provide a hot surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point you can use a hand whisk, or any number of the frothing gadgets that you can find in any cooking store (brick-and-mortar or online). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can, of course, just froth the milk, but what you're essentially doing is aerating it. That's fine, it's going to make a tasty drink, but it might fall short of your expectations if you don't &lt;em&gt;stretch&lt;/em&gt; the milk as well. The process is what makes the milk and the coffee fall in love and give birth to a latte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steam wand on espresso machines heats the milk &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; adds the air, giving you a lot more control over the process. However, this will work almost as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't ever let the milk get close to simmering. It'll burn very quickly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the handle if you have to put the pitcher back on the heat (as naturally, you took it off because it was approaching too hot to hold)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to get the milk &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the coffee as soon as possible once it has that gloss. Don't let it cool down too much while frothing (work fast)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's going to take some practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total for this would be about $15 for the stainless steel pitcher, $10 - $15 for the frother, so all total around 30 bucks. You could use a sauce pan, but it's &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; harder to gauge how hot the milk is if you do, and much harder to control when you pour. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why do most coffee shops use such dark roast?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that most (non-specialty) places that sell coffee tend to have very dark roasts. This includes Starbucks, any Fast Food restaurant, most nicer restaurants, and hotel coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't tolerate anything darker than Starbucks' "Blonde Roast". All their others I'd consider to be dark roast. When I buy coffee in the store and make it myself, it's never anywhere near as dark as what you get in shops. I usually get fresh beans from The Fresh Market or Caribou brand.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any reason shops tend to make their coffee so dark? Or is my taste just skewed from most people's?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Roasting coffee dark may be used because it is easier to create a consistently flavored bean, with less monitoring and concern for flavor profiles. In the case of Starbucks they are shipping so much of their coffee to so many locations and creating so much coffee at once that it may be easier to create consistency. The darker you roast the less the flavor of the original bean matters, so it may also be used as a method to roast cheaper or lower quality beans.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Breakfast or morning blends are generally a lighter roast, but there is no industry standard for how light of a roast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for differences between breakfast and morning blends, the key is in the word "blend". It is entirely up to the producer to blend different beans and different roasts and call it what they want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:
There are some differences in caffeine levels, but a lot of contradictory information out there. I found a great explanation of why the caffeine levels can differ between roasts &lt;a href="https://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/caffeine-myths-dark-vs-light" rel="noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but let me summarize from the post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you measure your coffee by scoops, light roasted coffee will have more caffeine. Since the beans are denser than a darker roast. However if you weigh out your scoops, darker roasts will have more caffeine, because there is less mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@ChrisAK is correct, the roasting process does not burn or destroy caffeine, but the level of roast will impact the weight of each bean.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What water temperature and pour speed are best for pour-over method?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I had a recent discussion with a friend of mine, which is the right &lt;em&gt;method&lt;/em&gt; to brew the coffee for pour-over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read that it's best to pour in hot (but not boiling) water into the filter and moisten the coffee powder. After that I should pour in the water until it is round about 1 cm over the coffee powder. After that I should let it flow out and fill the water up until it's reached the 1 cm mark over the powder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His method is a bit different. He just pours the hot (even if it's still boiling) water into the filter. He briefly moistens the coffee and then lets the rest of the water pour into the filter until his water can is empty. He only pauses from pouring if it reaches the top of the filter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said that his method isn't good, as the water will flow faster through the filter and the coffee won't be as aromatic as it would be with my method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brewing process I'm using is using the hand-filter with the Hario V60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which method is better? Does it matter how fast to pour the water in? Does it matter if the water is just hot or still boiling?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You're highlighting two differences between the two methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;temperature of the water, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rate of pouring the water (equivalently, how "full of water" is the cone).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short story: Use water just off the boil (about 96°C / 205°F). I prefer your "slower" pour method over your friend's... read on for why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer story:
Keeping all other factors identical, here's my take on each. I aggregate information from my own experience and from several other sites (including &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/bee-house" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Stumptown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/make-better-pourover-coffee-how-pourover-works-temperature-timing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Serious Eats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://coffeegeek.com/guides/howtouseapourover" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Coffee Geek&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature.&lt;/strong&gt; Most agree that water for pour-over should be &lt;strong&gt;just off the boil&lt;/strong&gt;, but exact temperature is both difficult to &lt;em&gt;measure&lt;/em&gt; and to &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt;. Exact recommendations differ, but most (including the 4 above) are approximately in the range of &lt;strong&gt;93-97°C / 200-207°F&lt;/strong&gt;. At this temperature, you extract the best balance of the "right stuff" from the beans. Much hotter or colder than this and it will have an "off" taste, such as more bitter. For example, try brewing coffee at 80°C / 175°F and see how it tastes compared to coffee brewed with 96°C / 205°F water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; technique and equipment, anyway, it would be essentially impossible for me to measure or maintain a temperature this accurately. Removed from the heat, the kettle itself will immediately start to cool; the water will cool between the pour spout and when it hits the grounds in the cone; the water will cool more when sitting on the grounds. For this reason, &lt;em&gt;I take water from a boiling kettle and begin to pour at my leisure.&lt;/em&gt; It might be a few degrees too hot at first, but it will probably finish a few degrees too cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate of pouring the water.&lt;/strong&gt; This seems to have more debate, e.g., on the 4 sites I listed above. Some pour only enough water at a time to have water just covering the grounds (like you and Blue Bottle), and some pour all the way up to the top of the cone (like your friend and Stumptown) -- however, a disadvantage of this all-at-once method is that some of the coffee will get pinned to the side of the cone for the final "drainage" and will not spend as much time in contact with the water; therefore some of your friend's coffee grounds will be underextracted. &lt;strong&gt;I do something of a hybrid: pour at such a rate as to keep the &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; at a steady rate.&lt;/strong&gt; The dripping rate will decrease as the filter gets somewhat clogged with grounds, so I keep very slowly raising the water level in the cone (just exceeding the rate of output); I find this produces the best result. Other ideas are to stir (as Coffee Geek suggests) or pour in batches (as Serious Eats suggests).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, other factors (e.g., the quality and freshness of beans) are overwhelmingly more significant than the manner of pouring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also want to consider &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use"&gt;rinsing your filter&lt;/a&gt;, and see more about &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/337/what-is-coffee-bloom"&gt;wetting the grounds for coffee bloom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are these spots on the inside of my moka pot? Do I need to remove them?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've got these spots on the inside the bottom section of my Bialetti Moka Express:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y21rR.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y21rR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are placed pretty evenly around the ridgy part toward the edge of the bottom of the circle, with a few toward the middle. They are only on the bottom of the pot as far as I can tell, not the sides. They look sort of like black mold, but I gave the pot a gentle scrub with warm water and a mild soap and they didn't budge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't normally use soap on my pot. Generally I make a cup of coffee, rinse all components, and allow them to air dry. Sometimes when I'm pressed for time, the just-used pot sits in the sink for a few hours without getting disassembled or rinsed. I have a hunch that that moisture may be contributing here. I use filtered water, so I don't think they are mineral deposits (unlike in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1847/moka-pot-buildup"&gt;this case&lt;/a&gt;). The pot is pretty new. It's been used 1-3 times per day for about three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are these spots? If they aren't affecting the flavor of the result, do I need to worry about them? If so, how can they be removed?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Short story: &lt;strong&gt;They are probably aluminum oxide&lt;/strong&gt;, but almost certainly some kind of metal oxide. &lt;strong&gt;You don't need to take any action unless they're affecting the taste of your coffee&lt;/strong&gt;, and it shouldn't be. You probably &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;shouldn't&lt;/em&gt;) really permanently remove them even if you wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer story...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href="http://www.bialetti.com/coffee/stovetop/moka-express-c-1_7_22.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;classic Bialetti&lt;/a&gt; model, and a classic Bialetti symptom. The vessel is probably made out of alumin[i]um alloy (though there are similar models that are made of stainless steel, your picture seems to be looking down into the bottom heating vessel, and it looks like the classic aluminum species). Unfortunately the symptoms you're seeing, from my perspective, is a classic &lt;em&gt;failure&lt;/em&gt; of the Bialetti design. Aluminum tarnishes (oxidizes) somewhat readily, especially when it is hot and in contact with water. Correspondingly, the only way to use this thing is, indeed, to heat it with water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vessel, especially, needs to be rinsed and &lt;em&gt;dried thoroughly&lt;/em&gt; in The Right Way.&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="http://www.bialetti.com/coffee/stovetop/moka-express-c-1_7_22.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;"care" page for Bialetti&lt;/a&gt; (follow that link, then click on the "Care Use" tab; I can't figure a direct link) suggests to &lt;em&gt;dry thoroughly&lt;/em&gt; and most tellingly "Do not reassemble the product until all parts are completely dry to avoid oxidation." Even if you're meticulously drying the thing, it's still going to be a little hot and a little damp; this is going to invite oxidation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard ways of removing tarnish are even more damaging in the long term than just leaving them alone. Aluminum oxide generally protects the metal from further oxidation (unlike rust -- iron oxide -- which flakes off and &lt;em&gt;facilitates&lt;/em&gt; further oxidation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a stainless steel moka pot, and it's terribly tarnished on the outside from heating on a gas burner hundreds of times, but the inside is clean (and clean&lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt;) as the metaphorical "whistle".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For completeness: It's also possible that they are mineral deposits; &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1849"&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt; to the other question that you linked has some additional info about that possibility. It would come from a buildup ("scale") from using "hard" water, and more so when nearly boiling dry (also not a good idea); filtered or distilled water is much less likely to do this. However, I think it's unlikely that you'd see scale buildup over the span of a couple dozen uses.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it possible to Cold Brew using an Aeropress?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to cold brew using Aeropress?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My inclination says yes, in a similar fashion to cold brewing with a French press.  However, when I tried it, it became very hard to plunge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from working on my arm strength, what tricks or methods can be used to ease that process?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Don't brew in the Aeropress itself. Brew in a jar like in classic methods and use the Aeropress only for fast and easy straining, taking care not to stir up the grounds from the bottom of the jar as you're pouring. Most of the coffees you strain out this way should be an absolute breeze. Only the last one you make (assuming a bigger jar) should give you any plunging force trouble, and that's if you insist on getting every last drop out (I know I do).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What does coffee leaf tea taste like?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have recently seen leaves of the coffee plant for sale for the purpose of making &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_tea_leaves"&gt;coffee leaf tea&lt;/a&gt; and I'm curious. &lt;strong&gt;What does it taste like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've heard various bold health claims about the antioxidant content, and that it has very little caffeine content (e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.treehugger.com/green-food/coffee-leaf-tea-hottest-new-beverage.html"&gt;treehugger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://modernfarmer.com/2015/03/things-we-want-to-try-coffee-leaf-tea/"&gt;modern farmer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/9797675/Tea-made-from-coffee-leaves-found-to-beneficial-for-health.html"&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;). It also sounds like a way for coffee farms to make some "off-season" profit, which is probably a win for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I'm interested in is the &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt;. The Wikipedia article (linked above) says it tastes like "green tea" but that's extremely varied, and others (like the link below) describe it as "sweet" or "refreshing" or "dry" but none of those are particularly helpful either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only seen &lt;a href="http://wizemonkey.com/shop/"&gt;this one place selling the stuff&lt;/a&gt; and they seem to be perpetually sold out, but maybe it's highly seasonal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leaves seem to be sold for $20 for 50g, or about $180/pound (since they're in Canada, I assume those are CAD/C$). Maybe it's like conventional tea, where even a gram goes far, but I don't know. Before I shell out that much, has anyone tried the stuff? &lt;strong&gt;What does it taste like? How is it prepared?&lt;/strong&gt; If it's like a tea-like coffee, that sounds delicious. Perhaps like &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/cascara" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;cascara&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;cascara&lt;/a&gt; or similar?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee stain in coffee cups</title>

&lt;p&gt;Baking soda has natural whitening properties and is a very gentle abrasive. I actually started using it elsewhere (sinks, counter tops, greasy pans) before discovering its use in coffee cups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also tried baking soda + salt on counter tops and pans with great success. Salt has similar whitening properties (surprisingly to me) and is a stronger abrasive. Haven't tried it in coffee cups, but you might consider trying that if you need a little extra cleaning power. (Also: Aside from being cheap, baking soda / salt are food-grade and non-toxic!) &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>If I'm in a rush, can I simply use raw ground coffee like instant coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about this for a while, and was wondering if it was safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we're sometimes ina big rush and there's not enough time.  Can I simply drop a spoonful of my favorite cheap coffee, i.e Maxwell, in a cup of water (should be boiled ) ; and then get started with my day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0GNU4.gif" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0GNU4.gif" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize they make instant coffee, but which is  slightly more pricy. Also, I feel that instant coffee has a somewhat artificial taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am wondering about the safety aspect of this, though. Is there any potential harm to ingesting some raw coffee grounds?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It boils down to taste - some people even chew whole beans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safety-wise there are no concerns&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and the method you propose is not unheard of, it goes by the term "Cowboy coffee" and others. Some preparation methods even quickly boil the grounds and water (Turkish coffee), other sources warn against pouring boiling water over your grounds and suggest letting the water cool a few degrees first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is up to you to decide whether you like the grainy residue you might taste if you don't let the grounds settle enough before drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, go ahead and do a taste test. You can always pour your coffee through a sieve or use the leftovers for drip coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; There is some discussion whether the slightly higher content of coffee oils compared to filtered matters healthwise, but that's a very vague subject, IMHO. Other brewing methods bring more oils as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Stainless steel moka pot with a crema valve for espresso-like crema</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Are there any moka pots (made of stainless steel) that produce crema? I know there is the Bialetti Brikka, but its made of aluminum and that's not what I'm looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the Brikka does not produce "real" crema, but it's good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.: Im not looking for a stainless steel pot (I do own  one), but rather for one that is similar to the Bialetti Brikka i.e. that it has a crema valve.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;My wife and I moved to our new house and we have an induction hob installed there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used our brikka(s) a lot and loved the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bought a 4 cup musa for the time being but compared to the brikka it tasted like fermented horse urine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to experiment:
Apparently the head from our 2 cup brikka fits the bottom of the 4 cup musa.
It worked! The results are fantastic.
I am going to purchase a 6 cups musa and see if it fits our 4 cup brikka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thread on the musa is a bit longer but it doesn't matter: just screw it hard until it locks to put pressure on the seal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use just the boiler tank from the musa and all the rest from the brikka as the coffee funnel filter of the musa doesn't have a rubber seal needed for the higher pressure.
Don't put too much water (fill the amount that matches the head. Not the tank)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck! &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Aeropress metal filters, are they worth it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering (other than the long term saving of not having to buy paper filters), what are the advantages of using a metal filter such as &lt;a href="http://www.hasbean.co.uk/products/able-disk"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the copy is states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fuller body cup of coffee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But is this something the average Joe would notice or is it marketing spiel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main thought would be you would get less of a papery taste, but after rinsing the filter, I can;t say that I've ever noticed the taste of paper from a filter (maybe if I had did an A/B test between the 2 I would?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would like to hear any thoughts from people that have one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have used both the paper filters and the "Able" brand metal AeroPress disk that you linked. They are a bit different, and I use both the metal disk and paper filter based on my mood. To my taste, &lt;strong&gt;the metal disk does produce a "fuller" bodied cup&lt;/strong&gt; (because more "stuff" comes through the filter -- oils and macro-particles or whatever). I believe that "an average user" (by my definition) would be able to tell the difference in a side-by-side test, and probably enough to determine preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I prefer the paper for a few reasons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;simple convenience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is better for me. After brewing, I plunge the filter and spent grounds directly into my compost container. After a quick rinse of the unit, it's clean enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my (personal) taste and preferences, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think the paper produces a better quality and more enjoyable cup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Since the perforations are larger, there is more grit in the output when using the metal disk, so you end up with a (small amount) of "sludge" in the bottom of your cup, and it will turn bitter more quickly because of longer contact with the grounds after brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I also prefer it for the marginal (and debatable) "health" reasons. Paper filters remove some compounds (such as cafestol) that have purported cholesterol-affecting properties. For more of "my opinion" on that, see &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1571/whats-the-difference-between-paper-and-long-lasting-filters"&gt;this question about general comparison between paper and re-usable filters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1578/262"&gt;my answer&lt;/a&gt; about the topic in general.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Brewing Coffee with instant hot water tap</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In my office they have a tap with (boiling) hot and cold filtered water system - its designed for hot drinks, and is fine for black tea.  I assume it dispenses at around 100 degrees, though I have not measured it.  The cold tap gives chilled water - I'd assume 5-10 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brew my coffee using an aeropress, with about 2 spoons worth of coffee and the standard paper filter. Filled up to a mark between the 2 and 3 marking on the aeropress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What comes out has a slight metallic, bitter taste.  I do not get this at home where I use a standard kettle (either leave it to boil and cool for a few minutes, or use my new kettle that can specify the temp - I generally use 85-90 degrees)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried to eliminate the problem thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different beans (2 different bags of fresh preground ground coffee, with both "standard for cafetiere grind" and espresso grinds).  Grinding at work is not an option and doing at home is too annoying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different storage (I thought the metal tin I was storing in was imparting bad flavour) - I have now got a glass kilner jar which is air tight and stored in a dark drawer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washing the paper filter before use (I dont do this at home normally)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the inverted method (with the same, or slightly less grounds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using another breakout area (with the same system) in case the normal one is broken/dirty/etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this makes a difference so I assume it is down likely down to the temperature of the water being too hot.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the best (quickest and least fussy) way of improving my brew?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have considered (but not yet attempted):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a small amount of cold water before adding the hot (approx 1/4 cold to 3/4 hot) then brewing as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the hot then add a splash of cold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixing in another cup and adding that - this is undesirable as I already have to carry the coffee jar, aeropress and cup to the kitchen and back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the best means to get a better brew?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Is it, by any chance, demineralised/distilled water, with no minerals added back in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from temperature (which you should check - it's OK if it's cooler, but too cool is no good, and knowing the temperature will help you modify other parameters), it's important to have high quality, odour-free water that is free from impurities and that has the correct mineral content. The SCAA actually specifies water standards (see &lt;a href="https://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&amp;amp;d=water-standards" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). In many developed parts of the world, tap water is fine. However, demineralised water is NOT fine. It will underextract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One solution*: Buy bottled mineral water (like Evian or a cheaper alternative), which usually has too HIGH a mineral content, and blend it with the filtered water from the dispenser. This may seem hard core, but it'd be good as an experiment to see if it cures your woes.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What can I do with bad coffee beans?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently was about to have a week before I could get my good coffee, so I went to the grocery store and got some of theirs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I pulled the lever and got way more grocery store coffee than I could ever need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also terrible. Short of tossing it, is there anything I can do to make it taste better until I get good coffee again? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Cold brew it! Make sure you start with very cold water and a coarse grind. Cold-temp chemistry has a better chance of taking what's good and leaving what's bad. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I improve this latte?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/DeLonghi-Dedica-Machine-EC680-BK-Espresso/dp/B00EZBTRDQ" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this Delonghi espresso machine&lt;/a&gt;. After much trial and error, I have got to the point where my I am able to make cappuccinos and lattes with a milk texture which is pleasing to taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make the textured milk/microfoam appropriate for a latte, rather than a foamy cappuccino, I had to remove the metal sleeve on the steam wand as this was preventing me from directing the wand precisely enough to swirl it into a microfoam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I have the following issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still can't get a fine enough foam to produce latte art. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My espresso and its crema do not seem dark enough to produce the contrast in colours you find in good latte art from a cafe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot seem to get the coffee and the milk to as hot a temperature as you get in a cafe - even if I pre-heat my cup. Could this because many cafes serve their coffee too hot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that the machine itself is simply not good enough, or do I need to improve my technique? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my latte:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nMbqR.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nMbqR.jpg" alt="My latte"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is the sort of result I'd like to be able to achieve: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT: Here is the type of milk pitcher I am using:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wk6T7.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wk6T7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I own this machine and have since moved on from it for the exact reasons you stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to create microfoam that is good enough for making clearly defined latte art on the Delonghi Dedica but it requires practice (as would doing the same on any machine). You did the right thing by removing the metal sleeve but the main problem is that the steam power is relatively weak and so it makes it harder to create the vortex required to properly incorporate the aerated milk. Focus on trying to create a spinning vortex/whirlpool type effect in your milk as this is the most important step in ensuring you end up with silky milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aerate the milk by keeping the tip of the steam wand near the surface of the milk. You should hear spitting noises. This will introduce air into the milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have aerated enough, dip the tip of the steam wand below the surface and try to form a vortex/whirlpool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spin the milk as in step 2 until the milk is at the right temperature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For good latte milk, you should not over-aerate. A good starting point is simply raising the height of the milk in your pitcher by about a centimetre. Once again, however, it will require practice and even then it may not be perfect due to the lack of steaming power this machine has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Delonghi Dedica also uses a pressurised portafilter basket which means that the crema you find in your cup is a result of artificial pressures produced inside the basket (similar to how Nespresso machines make their 'crema'). You can attempt to create darker crema by making the pressurised basket not the limiting factor of extraction by grinding finer (but not so fine as to choke the machine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temperature-wise, you want to ensure that your portafilter is heated by running empty shots through it as it will cool down the shot as it moves through the portafilter. The steam is also not as hot as commercial machines as they have dedicated boilers for the steaming rather than interchanging between functions within a few seconds like the Delonghi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, if you enjoy your coffee the way you make it, stick with the Delonghi Dedica but if you put a lot of value in the quality of the crema and being able to pour latte art then you might want to consider an upgrade or investing more time into practicing milk steaming.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Which type of coffee grinder is the quietest?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my question should be "What is the best type of grinder to use at my desk if I work in a cubicle and use a French Press?". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried finding decibel measurements on Amazon's website, but most of the coffee grinders listed don't specify them.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;First, lets ignore blade grinders entirely.  Any grinder that doesn't have a motor will be relatively quiet.  You'll be at the mercy of the crunching beans, but that's it.  Add to this that the more the grinder weighs, or the more "heft" it has to it, the quieter it will typically be due to the additional mass damping any vibration.  When adding a motor to the mix, each step between the motor and the burrs adds an opportunity for noise.  As such, a direct drive grinder will typically be quieter than anything involving a gearbox.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pecking order is basically...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hand Grinder --&gt; Direct Drive Flat Burr --&gt; Direct Drive Conical Burr --&gt; Gear-Reduced Burr&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Decibel ratings are available from most manufacturers, they're difficult to translate into a subjective estimate of "harshness."  I deal with these regularly and found that some of my favorite grinders are technically louder than several others, including the Baratza Vario. The difference is that they have a much more mellow drone rather than the gear motor's quieter whine.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is a shot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have visited Starbucks lots of times for their delicious coffee. As I stand in line, I hear people order coffee with like extra &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;shots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I tried searching up what it means but to no avail.  Here's an example of what I hear people say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would like some coffee with two extra shots please!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does the word "shot" mean in the coffee language? Yes, I have looked in the dictionary but no help was given.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;They are referring to a &amp;quot;shot&amp;quot; of espresso.  The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso#Brewing" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Italian standards&lt;/a&gt; are that it is a volume of 25 mL  plus or minus ten percent.  Additional shots in a drink indicate more espresso flavor and a higher caffeine content.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Use for old grounds?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm aware that coffee grounds can be great for composting, but living in a large city makes that more difficult than I'd prefer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every cup of coffee comes a bunch of soggy grounds that I normally throw away shortly after. Are there any constructive uses for spent grounds, be it culinary, cleaning, or scent related?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;They are very good as de-odourizers, we use them in the kitchen and sometimes in a small perforated plastic container in the footwell of the backseats in our car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fragrant smell lasts a long time also surprisingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also it seems to be useful in &lt;a href="http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/photos/0,,20593892_21157301,00.html"&gt;fridges&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;a href="http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/photos/0,,20593892,00.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; lists the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deodourize fridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a scouring agent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A cheap varnisher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dye for paper&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ash absorber&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exfoliant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cockroach trap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortifying plants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the above is quite a good list of uses that could be applicable for your situation&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How does one descale an espresso machine (and how often to do it)?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;One of the common regular maintenance items for an espresso machine is to descale it, to remove the buildup of minerals inside the machine (particularly the heating element).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How often should I do this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the benefits of regular descaling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do I need to do this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I actually go about descaling the machine?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You can use a solution of citric acid and some espresso machine manufacturers will sell this specifically, you can use general purpose descaler, for which there should be instructions on how much to dilute it by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking from experience it depends on how hard the water is where you live and you should really do it every month if it is a hard water area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found that I need to remove the fine filter where the coffee is pumped out to remove the gasket seal and clean all of the above, I was lazy and neglected my Gaggia for about 6 months and after a couple years the solenoid pump died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The less hassle method would be to use bottled soft mineral water. For instance I have started to only use this with my kettle and there is no limescale build up since switching 1 1/2 months ago, whilst before, using Brita filtered water would start to show limescale after a week and I'd need to descale after 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the instructions on my descaling solution for a coffee machine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Add 100ml of solution to 500ml of water and add to water reservoir,
  turn on and run through the machine. Then run 2 full reservoirs of
  water before using again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember with citric acid you had to pump it through and then leave for 30 minutes and then fully flush a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a youtube video from Gaggia about performing this: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SPkjWJzUJQ"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SPkjWJzUJQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing here is that if you don't do it then limescale starts to form on the metal filter and gasket seals which will affect the flow rate. This isn't the worst bit though, like with any heating system that uses hard water, the hard limescale will inhibit the heating and pumping performance which can lead to a complete pump failure which is what happened to my machine, I recommend using citric acid (which is a weak acid and safe to consume in diluted form) and/or bottled mineral water.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How vigorously should I heat my moka?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I usually use a moka pot on my gas stove, and on the smallest flame adjusted so it's roughly the same size as the base, I get good results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when I'm at my parents', I use their moka on an &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/78/most-moka-pots-dont-work-on-my-induction-stove-how-can-i-still-use-them"&gt;induction hob&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; fierce. On the hottest setting, the moka practically explodes - boiling over (even from cold) in a few seconds with a powerful spurt of superheated steam - not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question then is how do I judge what setting on the induction hob to use for a good brew? How long should I expect a 6-cup pot to take to start extraction? Is turning down the heat once extraction has started to prevent the violent spurt at the end a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm going to start by answering your last question first just for fun. In this &lt;a href="http://ineedcoffee.com/brewing-espresso-in-a-moka/" rel="nofollow"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;, it says that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Place the pot over a low flame. A low flame increases the brew time, which enhances the flavor. At a later step, you’ll want a slow trickle of espresso instead of a full-force fountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would want a nice, long brew time. The flavor will be enhanced rather than the quick brew time with a large fire. So flavor and brew time can be changed depending on the size of your heat. To answer that question, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;YES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; it is a great idea to turn down the heat. &lt;strong&gt;EXTRA&lt;/strong&gt;: The site also shows how to make a nice moka (not spam)! Second, you really answered your last question yourself. Low heat is better than high heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I'm going to answer your second question. Looks like this &lt;a href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/Beverage/MokaEspressoPot.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; uses Italian pots just like your induction hob. For stovetop pots and not stovepot pots, it says that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the water in the tank has been exhausted, that's when you hear the ‘gurgle’ that signifies the drink is ready to pour (approximately 4 to 5 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like 4 to 5 minutes is just the right time for the coffee to be ready for extraction here. You should know the sound of someone using mouthwash and gurgling. The coffee pot will start to produce that sound when coffee is ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I will answer your first question. I can't seem to find any significant information on your question, so I'll take a shot at it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Supposedly, it might be your decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe some people like this setting while others like another. I don't know what your standards for a good brew is so I'll just say that you should choose it. Sorry for the lack of information! I hope this answer answered all your questions!&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/403/92"&gt;the "plunging" method of cold brew&lt;/a&gt;, and filtering the grounds out of the brew --I use a coffee filter in a funnel-- is very time-consuming (although thankfully it doesn't take me the "hours" &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/423/92"&gt;this person describes&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I reduce the time and labour of filtering the grounds out of my plunged cold brew coffee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I tried making cold brew for the first time recently and I just poured the whole mess through the &lt;a href="http://www.mrcoffee.com/parts-and-accessories/coffeemaker-gold-tone-permanent-filter-10-12-cup-cup-style/GTF2-NP.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;reusable metal screen filter&lt;/a&gt; that came with my cheap drip coffee machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yPekO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I just put the metal filter in and poured the cold brew straight into the filter allowing the filtered brew to flow into the regular pot below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked pretty well for the 8 cups or so that I made and it looked like I probably could have gotten away with pouring a bit more. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the impact of espresso tamper base shape?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;As I shop for a new espresso tamper, I see that there are a dizzying array of options for the &lt;em&gt;shape of the base&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., the shape of the part that contacts the grounds). Some shapes include convex ("Euro" more curved than "American"), flat, rippled, or hybrids of those -- see some examples at &lt;a href="http://coffeetamper.com/store/pc/viewContent.asp?idpage=7" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Reg Barber&lt;/a&gt;. (I'm also aware that there are many &lt;em&gt;shapes and sizes of the handle&lt;/em&gt;, and differing &lt;em&gt;sizes&lt;/em&gt; for the base; I'm not asking about those.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part spurred by &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1583/what-is-essential-for-a-proper-tamp"&gt;this recent question on the essentials of tamping&lt;/a&gt;, and other questions tagged &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/tamping" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;tamping&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;tamping&lt;/a&gt; (which are mostly about pressure), I got to thinking that the shape of the tamper could have a significant impact on the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also seems to be a fairly large amount of &lt;em&gt;personal preference or opinion&lt;/em&gt; in this realm. I can't find any proper comparisons or trials; at best I can find conversations about various preferences (e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.home-barista.com/tips/flat-or-curved-tamper-base-t7752.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;home-barista&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href="http://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/tamper-bottoms-flat-or-convex-t24.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this poll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://coffeegeek.com/forums/espresso/questions/38331" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;coffeegeek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.coffeeforums.com/forum/coffee-espresso-machines/1234-tamper-flat-curved.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;coffee forums&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.baristaexchange.com/forum/topics/tampers-flat-or-convex-which" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;barista exchange&lt;/a&gt;). A few patterns emerge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;curved bottom provides a greater &lt;em&gt;margin of error&lt;/em&gt; for avoiding the "donut" effect of water channeling around the perimeter of the portafilter;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;curved bottom could over-compact the center;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ripple shape is pretty, is used by some pros including winner of a competition in 2009, but has no demonstrable benefit, and is marginally harder to clean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I'm not spurring a sectarian flame-war by asking this; so I try to ask as objectively as possible: &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; benefit for one tamper base shape over another?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, side-by-side trials; experienced use beyond preferences; ...&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you only use a double (14g) portafilter basket then you're best to use a 58mm convex tamper. This is because if you look at the basket, in most cases, the sides will slope in. Therefore, if you had a flat 58mm tamper then the you are compressing to outer more than the inner. Obviously the whole point of tamping is to compress the grounds consistently throughout the whole puck, so this would achieve this the best. If you want to use a flat tamper for any reason in this situation, you would be best using a 57mm flat tamper and tap the edge of the portafilter to knock any loose grounds back down into the basket and then rotate the tamper over to produce a flat surface for the water to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, however, you are using a single (7g) portafilter basket then the 58mm tamper would probably be too wide to compress the grounds evenly as it may not go far enough down in the portafilter basket to tamp it at all. Therefore, you would be best using a 57mm tamper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're using a triple basket then a 58mm convex rules would apply the same as the double basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all based on the assumption that the basket is 58mm. This is the most common size but other sizes do crop up, commonly on older machines which may use a 53mm basket. In this case the flat/convex rules still apply, just with the smaller diameter.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Convert Mahlkönig EK43 settings to other grinders</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to test the new AeroPress World Champions recipe, and my question is how do I translate the setting "7.3" on Mahlkönig EK43 to my Graef CM 80. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any way to get the same result on my grinder?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I had the same question as well. The Mahklonig scale is from 1 (fine) - 11 (coarse), based on some images, so you could assume that 7.3 is about a drip grind, and then adjust to taste based on results&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is coffee really useful for alcohol hangovers</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When people experience a hangover due to too much alcohol intake the hours before, sometimes they are offered a good cup of coffee (at least in my country), not as the only or the main "treatment", but as a helping element in such a condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any scientific evidence for this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;No.  Coffee is often offered to people perhaps about to pass out so that they will stay awake long enough that they can be kicked out of an establishment.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alcohol causes dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and taxes the liver.  To this extent standard medical treatment is fluid, electrolytes, and vitamins.  Caffeine is never used in a medical setting to treat alcohol overdose or withdrawal.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there more caffeine with an AeroPress?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I like everything about the AeroPress; however, I noticed that I exhibited symptoms which I usually only have when I've consumed too much caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of using two scoops during preparation per instructions, I scaled down to one. That seemed to help, but not enough--if I use the same coffee and amount in a conventional coffeemaker and consume it all in one sitting, I don't feel over-stimulated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the AeroPress simply make "stronger" coffee with regards to caffeine content?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Aeropress coffee (hearby called Aerpresso in this post) is more concentrated than regular drip coffee.  However, if you are using similar amounts of grounds as you would in a drip machine, you shouldn't notice any difference.  Caffeine is highly soluble in hot water and most any extraction method utilizing hot water will result in nearly full extraction of caffeine from grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aerpresso ends up somewhere in caffeine concentration between espresso (very concentrated) and drip coffee (less concentrated).  However, the total amount of caffeine is dependent more on the amount of grounds used that the extraction method (with the above listed methods). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the the final answer is no.  There isn't more caffeine, but the Aerpresso is more concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee as a factor in rapid scientific progress?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Balzac is one of many authors* who have cited coffee as a boost to creativity (or at least productivity). See &lt;a href="http://www.openculture.com/2013/09/honore-de-balzac-on-the-pleasures-and-pains-of-coffee.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, for example.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is whether anyone has argued that coffee or caffeine was a factor in the rapid advancement of science beginning in 1600 or so. Coffee houses such as &lt;a href="http://www.history.co.uk/study-topics/history-of-london/londons-coffee-houses"&gt;The Grecian&lt;/a&gt; were frequented by the likes of Sir Isaac Newton. True or not, it seems unlikely no one has thought to connect caffeine consumption and its gift of marginally-increased clarity** to the revolution in science and humanities in Europe.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone could point to articles on this topic or has a feel for the history involved that would be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Rényi said, "A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems." We wouldn't credit coffee for his success but there is a probably a grain (or bean) of truth there.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;What to keep in mind is, that during the middle ages, alcoholic drinks were pretty much the &lt;a href="https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/268/did-everyone-drink-beer-in-the-middle-ages"&gt;main beverage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Before public sanitation, cholera and other water-transmitted diseases
  were a significant cause of death. Because the process of brewing any
  beer from malt involves mashing and boiling which effectively
  pasteurizes the wort, and the fermentation and hops protect against
  infection, drinking small beer instead of water was one way to escape
  infection. It was not uncommon for workers (including sailors) who
  engaged in heavy physical labor to drink more than 10 Imperial pints
  (5.7 liters) of small beer during a workday to slake their thirst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_beer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia on "Small Beer"&lt;/a&gt;, a lightly alcoholic beverage)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote from an &lt;a href="http://gladwell.com/java-man/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Malcom Gladwell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What this flood of caffeine did, according to Weinberg and Bealer, was to abet the process of industrialization–to help “large numbers of people to coordinate their work schedules by giving them the energy to start work at a given time and continue it as long as necessary.” Until the eighteenth century, it must be remembered, many Westerners drank beer almost continuously, even beginning their day with something called “beer soup.” (Bealer and Weinberg helpfully provide the following eighteenth-century German recipe: “Heat the beer in a saucepan; in a separate small pot beat a couple of eggs. Add a chunk of butter to the hot beer. Stir in some cool beer to cool it, then pour over the eggs. Add a bit of salt, and finally mix all the ingredients together, whisking it well to keep it from curdling.”) Now they began each day with a strong cup of coffee. One way to explain the industrial revolution is as the inevitable consequence of a world where people suddenly preferred being jittery to being drunk. In the modern world, there was no other way to keep up. That’s what Edison meant when he said that genius was ninety-nine per cent perspiration and one per cent inspiration. In the old paradigm, working with your mind had been associated with leisure. It was only the poor who worked hard. (The quintessential pre-industrial narrative of inspiration belonged to Archimedes, who made his discovery, let’s not forget, while taking a bath.) But Edison was saying that the old class distinctions no longer held true–that in the industrialized world there was as much toil associated with the life of the mind as there had once been with the travails of the body.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Ground coffee or beans</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have just recently started drinking coffee, and have got myself a small counter top espresso machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people in work have suggested that instead of buying ground coffee (I have been using Lavazza ground coffee) I should buy beans and grind it myself. I have asked why, but no one has been able to give a better answer than "it just is better", so I am hoping someone here can help me find a better answer to this question. Or is it just personal preferences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as a newcomer to this, I know that the coffee someone uses is down to personal tastes and what have you, but I am just wondering if there are any coffee manufacturers who are very good when it comes to espresso (I mostly drink espresso).&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Ground beans have a much larger surface area by weight than whole beans. When the surface of the bean is exposed to air chemical reactions take place. I doubt that these reactions have been completely characterized but at a minimum they include some loss of aromatic oils. In other words, the processes that lead to a judgment that coffee is "old" happen faster in ground coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do the experiment easily and cheaply by comparing the results of coffee made with freshly-ground and pre-ground versions of same brand/date coffee. You can always borrow a grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experiment might not work if both samples of coffee are old (or poor quality). Otherwise I think you would notice a difference. Whether the difference is worth paying for is a different question; but the only costs are a grinder and time to grind the beans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short answer to the question about brands might be: good, fresh Arabica beans are similar in many ways, up to roasting. Some people prefer a light roast, others medium or dark. Once you decide, find a brand that does what you like consistently. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Reduce power of popcorn popper for roasting coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been roasting coffee for a couple of years now, and I've always used a popcorn popper.  I'm interested in taking things a bit more seriously and would like to be a bit more meticulous when it comes to roast level.  I find that my popcorn popper (1200 W) roasts coffee a little too quickly, to the point that it becomes difficult to get a precise and consistent roast level from time to time.  Does anyone know of anyway that I could reduce the power of the roaster?  If it roasted at a lightly slower pace I feel like I would have better control over the process.  I've heard people suggest plugging it in through an extension cord or a power strip, which will reduce the power going to the popper.  Is there a more principled or controlled way of doing this?  Some sort of device that goes in between the popcorn popper plug and the outlet that would let me adjust the power at a fine granularity would be ideal.  Does this sort of technology exist?  Perhaps a sort of light switch dimmer would work?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Rather than playing with electricity and wiring you could actually just move the roasting bed/area away from your heat source and accomplish close to the same thing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started roasting with a popper as well.  The hole in the popper was roughly 3 inches so I got a 3 to 4 inch duct adapter, a 4 inch flour sifter and mushed it all together, similar to &lt;a href="http://207.66.12.210/CoffeeRoasting/3CupSetup.jpg"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  The result was that I moved the coffee away from the heat source.  The sifter also allows you to stir and get more even results.  I think I went from 4 to 5 minute roast time to 7 or 8 minutes with this method and the parts were very cheap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the &lt;a href="http://www.sweetmariascoffee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;amp;t=5331&amp;amp;start=20"&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt; for that picture actually has additional mods close to what you may be looking for if you actually want to take your popper apart and try rewiring it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Will I be addicted to caffeine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;If I drink coffee everyday, will I be addicted to it, or is it just a myth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any risk to my own health due to caffeine?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-004-2000-x"&gt;this review&lt;/a&gt; published in Psychopharmacology, it is very much not a myth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The caffeine-withdrawal syndrome has been well characterized and there
  is sufficient empirical evidence to warrant inclusion of caffeine
  withdrawal as a disorder in the DSM and revision of diagnostic
  criteria in the ICD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More explicitly (emphasis my own):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of 49 symptom categories identified, the following 10 fulfilled
  validity criteria: headache, fatigue, decreased energy/activeness,
  decreased alertness, drowsiness, decreased contentedness, depressed
  mood, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and foggy/not
  clearheaded. In addition, flu-like symptoms, nausea/vomiting, and
  muscle pain/stiffness were judged likely to represent valid symptom
  categories. In experimental studies, the incidence of headache was 50%
  and the incidence of clinically significant distress or functional
  impairment was 13%. Typically, onset of symptoms occurred 12–24 h
  after abstinence, with peak intensity at 20–51 h, and for a duration
  of 2–9 days. In general, the incidence or severity of symptoms
  increased with increases in daily dose; abstinence from &lt;strong&gt;doses as low
  as 100 mg/day produced symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;. Research is reviewed indicating that
  expectancies are not a prime determinant of caffeine withdrawal and
  that avoidance of withdrawal symptoms plays a central role in habitual
  caffeine consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for health risks, beyond the symptoms of withdrawal, caffeine has been linked to a number of conditions, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895706102031552"&gt;Aortic stiffness among hypertensions patients.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/urinary-incontinence-oab/news/20100930/caffeine-and-bladder-problems-linked"&gt;Incontinence among women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/186223/reload=0;jsessionid=CzWm7s65jDRhoHPFzX4K.10"&gt;Insomnia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3702680?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"&gt;Cardiac Arrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to summarize: Yes, you can be addicted to caffeine. No, it is not a myth. And it seems like you need as little as 100mg a day to be addicted, that is the equivalent of 1.5 espresso shots, according to &lt;a href="http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/espresso"&gt;this link.&lt;/a&gt;. Prolonged caffeine use can be harmful, moderation is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Differences between Chemex &amp; V60</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I currently use a V60, but I'm interested in using a Chemex (primarily because of the bigger capacity for guests).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming all variables are correct for the specific brew method (grind size, weight of coffee, filters etc) but the coffee &amp;amp; water used are from the same source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be the differences between the taste of a cup of coffee from a Chemex and a cup from a V60?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Here's a few more things to add to @fredley's answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the water is going to be in contact with the grounds for a longer time (1- using greater volume of water, and 2- Chemex filter will be slower) you're going to get more of the bitter notes that you get (in general) by using a longer brewing time. Acidity will be offset somewhat by the bitterness. I find Chemex to be like a filter-coffee version of the body of a French Press preparation, though with no sediment. Compared to the throughput of V60 filters, @fredley hit it on the nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though you are asking about taste specifically, there are other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like @fredley said, the filter paper in Chemex is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; thicker and water drains through it &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; more slowly. You'll probably want to use a coarser grind (and very even grind) than you would for V60 or Melitta-style filters. Fines are the enemy of Chemex, causing the filter to clog and welling (see &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1658/why-does-the-filtrate-sometimes-well-up-in-the-upper-cone-when-using-the-chemex"&gt;this question about "welling up" in a Chemex&lt;/a&gt; for more on that). Certainly use the best burr grinder you can and don't delay in the pouring action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technique is "more important" (read as: "finicky") with Chemex, I think, than other pour-over systems. See preparation guides such as from &lt;a href="http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/brewing-product-care-instructions" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chemex itself&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/chemex" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Stumptown&lt;/a&gt;, or search for others.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Espresso drips out slowly</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So my wife and I have a &lt;a href="http://www.delonghi.com/en-us/products/coffee-and-espresso/coffee-makers/pump-espresso/ec-155-0132104089"&gt;Delonghi EC155&lt;/a&gt; espresso machine that we have used for years.  Lately it's been having a lot of trouble pushing the water through the coffee.  We can hear the pump pumping, but the water just barely drips out.  We end up having to pull it 2 or 3 times to get a full shot (or just wait for the drips to fill up the shot glass).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened up this machine once before in the hopes of cleaning it, but found almost everything inside pretty clean and the plumbing is all sealed up.  So I'm a little befuddled as to what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I fix my machine so that the shots come out in a single pull?  I wonder if my pump just can form enough pressure anymore - can I measure the pressure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note on the grounds:  We have the grinder set to the finest grind, which comes out like a fine sand.  We've had it this way for a long time and not had any problems.  We fill the basket to about 1/2 full (it's a double shot basket, and we only need one shot - the single shot basket was fed to the garbage disposal years ago) and tamp.  I've been tamping more lightly recently, thinking that the problem was grounds that are too compressed to let the water through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As suggested in comment above, &lt;a href="https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/service/tech-tips/descaling-home-espresso-machine" rel="noreferrer"&gt;descaling&lt;/a&gt; or decalcifying your machine may solve your problem. We just run straight distilled white vinegar through ours to do so. Running the machine with distilled water rather than tap water helps keep mineral deposits to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, running it without water can create an airlock (which makes it take a while for the water to pull through), and allows the pump to spin freely, and so can wreak havoc on, or at least weaken the pump. (I don't know what specific pump is employed by your machine, but &lt;a href="https://keithspecialty.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/can-i-damage-my-pump-if-i-run-out-of-water/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; may apply.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in the event that the pump has become weakened, it can be helpful to keep the reservoir completely full of water. I do not believe that a normally working machine would be affected too much by the grinding coarseness selected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edited to add: While commercial descaling/decalcifying solutions are available (and might work really well) for this application, the staff on a &lt;a href="https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/full-circle-single-cup-cleaning-descaling-liquid" rel="noreferrer"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; selling such reports in the Q&amp;amp;A, "Breville actually recommends using vinegar to descale their machines while you're under their warranty." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When deciding what to use, it may be to one's advantage to research whether the product is under warranty, and what the specific manufacturer recommends. Also, take into consideration that the unlisted chemicals that might be found in a given solution could put off foul odors and/or flavors (not that vinegar makes a good perfume, by any means).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.  I just found out that the &lt;a href="http://www.urnexbrand.com/attachments/FC_Single_Clean_Desc_GB.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;safety data sheet&lt;/a&gt; for one descaling liquid contains the following hazard warning (although the company might issue the same warning about vinegar if they sold it): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHS_hazard_statements" rel="noreferrer"&gt;H315 Causes skin irritation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What volume of beans yields a tablespoon of ground coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have recently switched from using pre-ground coffee to grinding my own beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the pre-ground, I used 1.5 tbsp per cup, however when i used the equivalent in beans (before grinding) the coffee was noticeably weaker. This makes sense to some degree, since the packing density of beans is lower than ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there an established ratio of beans-to-ground which I can use to accurately determine what volume of beans I need to grind to produce the same strength I had before?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the packing density, is there any other reason why the beans would be weaker than ground on a equal mass basis?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Here's an opportunity to start refining your brewing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee brewers, including myself, tend to use weight as our measuring unit as opposed to volume since bean sizes vary significantly already without accounting for origin or roast level. All of these factors will change the real amount of coffee you believe you have once ground and also change the extraction parameters needed to make a cup of coffee of the 'same strength'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what it sounds, I doubt that the beans you use are of the same variety as the pre-ground coffee you used to use. Not all coffee will taste the same nor brew the same, and the best way to track and refine your brewing to your taste is to measure accurately your bean (origin/blend, roast level, weight used, grind size), water (to coffee ratio, temperature, purity), and extraction time. Depending on what brewing method you use there may be more parameters you will have to account for but ultimately the aforementioned factors will always play a role in any form of coffee brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by weighing an amount of pre-ground coffee that you used previously to find out how much coffee you used exactly and start by grinding that much of your new beans to brew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;On the surface, it seems that you can divide coffee drinkers into---very broadly---two groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artisan coffee drinkers. You make pour-over coffee with a gooseneck kettle, you hot-rod your espresso machine, you roast your own beans, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mass-market coffee drinkers. Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, flavored lattes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(At least, this seems true in the US, which is the environment I know best.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is this: &lt;strong&gt;is there a group identity for people who fall between those two poles?&lt;/strong&gt; I'm thinking of &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2032/using-an-areo-press-with-maxwell-house"&gt;this person&lt;/a&gt;, who wants to use an Aeropress to make Maxwell House coffee, or someone approximating espresso in a moka pot, or someone making a Vietnamese coffee with Café du Monde, or someone who invests in good beans but brews in a &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00008IHK5" rel="noreferrer"&gt;decent-but-not-stellar drip machine&lt;/a&gt;. In all those cases you have someone who takes trouble with his or her coffee, but makes deliberate compromises based on cost/effort/time/whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Based on the wording of your question; I believe there is no current classification for this denomination in the coffee market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you compare this with the electronics market; there are devices developed for the "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosumer" rel="noreferrer" title="Prosumer"&gt;prosumer&lt;/a&gt;" market which are targeted at professional consumers (average Joe that can make it rain), but are not used to their full capacity. For example, I can buy the latest Macbook Pro laptop and only use it for iTunes, or buy a high powered Microsoft Surface Studio PC and only use Microsoft Paint because Photoshop is too expensive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start generating momentum to classify this marketing group, you could say that this group of people (without trying to be offensive) would be classified as lazy prosumers?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How V60 and Aeropress affect flavor</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've heard that the V60 is better for light roasts and the Aeropress is better for Medium to Dark roasts, but could someone describe how these two brewing devices affect the flavor of coffee brewed for the different roasts (and which, in turn, would be preferable)?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;That sounds like the generalization that drip or pour over brewing is better for light roasts and stronger brewing methods are better for darker roasts.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll counter that by saying that I often use my Aeropress for lighter roasts and my Clever Dripper for dark roasts and those cups come out just fine.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aeropress makes a sort of quasi-espresso cup that isn't true espresso, but is much stronger than just strong coffee.  I've found that it is unsuitable or less than satisfactory for beans that aren't recommended for espresso brewing.  While the Aeropress allows less control over "brew" strength.  The V60 should be more flexible.  Varying the grind and pour speed should allow a level of control not present with an Aeropress.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What preparation method yields the most caffeine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I want to make the most caffeinated coffee possible. What method should I use to yield the most caffeine content per liter?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The first thing you want to do is choose the right bean and the right roast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer roasting removes some of the caffeine from the bean, so a lighter roast would be preferred. Additionally you should chose Robusta beans, since their inherent caffeine content is higher than that of arabica beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is the grinding. The smaller you grind, the easier it is to extract "material" from the ground. This is due to the additional surface area you expose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the last step is the extraction. The longer you expose the ground to water, the more substances you absorb. The extraction roughly has three steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extraction of Acidity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extraction of Sweetness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extraction of Bitterness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually you try to stop extraction after the second step, to have the coffee taste nicely. By that point in time most of the caffeine is already extracted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd want to get &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the caffeine out of a ground, you'd have to go through with extracting the bitterness, too. But for general purpose drinkable coffee it's definitely preferrable to stop after extracting the sweetness&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What actually happens with the ground coffee that lost its flavour?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Ground coffee looses quickly its flavour. It's especially painful for singles living in rented apartment (no coffee machine) and having only big packages in nearby groceries...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what actually happens to that coffee? What is lost, other then flavour? How the taste is affected? Does the caffeine amount also changes? Do some chemical processes happen, that can make such an old coffee unhealthy?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As far as I know the aroma is gone first, the oils begin to dry out and the taste goes down as well. I don't know how long it takes the caffeine to go away. I have drunk coffee over a year old and there still was caffeine. (I go camping and there was a bag left over from the previous year.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a different note - as a lifelong NYer I don't see how living in a small space precludes having a grinder. Even - gasp - a cheap krup kitchen grinder is better than buying bags of store ground coffee. (IMHO) Although I would buy a hand grinder instead. &lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Word on the street is that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The milk residue will get "baked on" by the heat of the steam wand, making it even more difficult to clean than if you'd just done it when the milk was still wet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any milk left on the tip of the wand will get sucked up into the machine's water reservoirs by changes in air pressure, where it will stay and become rancid and ruin everybody's drinks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  <title>What is the ideal method/temp of brewing Turkish coffee in a Cezve?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Are there specific methods to brewing the perfect Turkish coffee and temperature to heat it to?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You should heat your coffee upto about 70 degrees Celcius so it builds a foam or froth but do not let it boil! You need to keep it at this stage for as long as you can, and if the coffee starts to get to hot and appears to rise then move it off the heat and repeat at most 2 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few important things are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use fresh coffee or it will not foam as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pre-heat the water in the pot first, without the coffee, just until it starts to heat up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not stir until the coffee sinks itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow the coffee to heat slowly, not on a high heat (I don't directly place the pot on the heat ring - slightly off of it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a link to a useful page on Turkish coffee world website with a method for making Turkish coffee.

  <title>Is harvest time important for coffee quality?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The other day, I spoke to a tea fanatic. he introduced me into tea world and also explained me, that harvest time of tea leaves has significant role in tea quality. (Especially the &lt;em&gt;first flush&lt;/em&gt; which is the first harvest in given year)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made me wonder: &lt;strong&gt;Is there any significance to coffee quality regarding the bean's harvest time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, it does&lt;/strong&gt;, but it's much more complex than that :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvest times vary greatly depending on the latitude, altitude and variety of beans being harvested. There is a &lt;a href="http://www.sweetmarias.com/coffee.prod.timetable.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;very large table here&lt;/a&gt; which illustrates the variety of harvest/shipping seasons, as well as the optimum points of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, December-February is best, but some countries vary anywhere from June to October. Some countries with a larger variety of crops have a lot of different 'Best' points, e.g. Kenya:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9nIDC.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;

  <title>Is coffee a solution or an emulsion?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;According this &lt;a href="http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2011/May/ChemistryInEveryCup.asp"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about the chemical composition of coffee, 12% of the dry weight of green unroasted coffee beens are chlorogenic acids. It does not mention if these acids fully dissolve in water when brewing coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore they are mentioning &lt;em&gt;"over 1000 aroma compounds"&lt;/em&gt;. Do they dissolve?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All together, is a cup of coffee a solution or an emulsion? If it is a solution, is there such thing as a maximum saturation level for a cup of coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A cup of coffee is definitely a solution, in the sense that it is composed of dissolved solutes. The solvation occurs once water is introduced. While, there is always a limit to how much of a substance can be solvated in a given amount of solvent, with coffee you're likely to not reach the point of creating a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersaturation" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;super-saturated solution&lt;/a&gt; in normal conditions. If you were to take a pot of brewed coffee, and boil it, removing the solvent (water) you will likely reach a point as to where the solution is supersaturated, followed by precipitation of a crude extract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is coffee an emulsion? I have heard that typical brewed coffee contains oils from the bean (likely oils that can be seen on darker roasts). If this is the case, then we could say that coffee is both a solution &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an emulsion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; I know this is an older question but I want to clarify some definitions:
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Under IUPAC definition of an emulsion&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note 4: An emulsion is termed an oil/water (o/w) emulsion if the
  dispersed phase is an &lt;strong&gt;organic material&lt;/strong&gt; and the continuous phase is
  water or an &lt;strong&gt;aqueous solution&lt;/strong&gt; and is termed water/oil (w/o) if the dispersed
  phase is water or an aqueous solution and the continuous phase is an
  organic liquid (an "oil").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when I say coffee is a solution, I'm referring to dissolved solids in the aqueous phase (an aqueous solution). When I say it's an emulsion, I'm referring to the "oils" of the coffee dispersed in the aqueous solution. By the above definition, &lt;strong&gt;coffee would qualify as an o/w emulsion composed with an aqueous solution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to make coffee concentrate</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I searched around a bit and found a few recipes for coffee concentrates, but most of them read more like high test cold brew recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I work we have a few "coffee"  &lt;sub&gt;(note the quotation marks)&lt;/sub&gt; machines that use the stuff. The "coffee" from these machines is really awful and I was wondering if there are alternative methods for making it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to take drip coffee and cook it down and reduce it into a concentrate, has anyone tried this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I way off track? Is there a better way?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Just make cold brew! It's called "cold brew", but you can still make good hot coffee out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold brew is essentially hyperconcentrated, but slow-brewed, coffee. It's very popular in the United States in the summer, because it's very easy to make excellent iced coffee with a cold brew concentrate. (Just add water and ice.) But you can also make a cup of hot coffee out of cold brew concentrate: just add hot water instead of cold water and ice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-coffee-concentrate-to-serve-hot-coffee-to-a-crowd-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-187198" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here's a recipe&lt;/a&gt;, but I'll summarize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~12 oz coarsely ground coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~6 cups water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour water over coffee in a large bowl or pitcher and stir. Cover with a tea towel and let sit on the counter (or fridge) for 24 hours. You can vary the coffee:water ratio and brewing time depending on your preferences. Strain thoroughly. Reserve the delicious liquid and discard the grounds. The concentrate will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a cup of hot coffee, add about 2 parts hot water to 1 part cold brew (depending on your taste). Add the hot water slowly until it's tasty to you. Dilute with a similar amount of cold water for iced coffee - then add ice. Add milk, sugar, and other fixings as desired. (If you're drinking it iced, you'll want to use &lt;a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/simple-syrup" rel="nofollow"&gt;simple syrup&lt;/a&gt; to sweeten, since plain sugar won't dissolve well in cold liquid.)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How often do I need to change the filter on a siphon?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Many siphons use a small piece of metal wrapped into a fine cloth. The piece of metal makes them robust, and it seems to me they can be used for a long time. The piece of cloth is usually of enough quality to remain in good condition for long. A piece of cloth can however get dirty, rough, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long do you recommend to use a siphon filter? What would be the criteria to drive for change?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I've typically used the same cloth filter on a hario syphon for several (2 - 3 probably) months of continuous use (1 or 2 syphons daily). We clean the cloth after each use using a mild detergent, hot water and a soft scrubbing brush. Rinse very well after each wash. Typically, after a week or so we soak the cloth in oxyclean or similar for a couple of hours to get it super clean and then follow this up with a normal wash and thorough rinse. The coffee &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; stain the cloths after the first use, so don't expect it to return to the same colour it was originally no matter how often or well you wash it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first bought a syphon about five years ago we were recommended to store the filter in a glass jar of water in the fridge to prevent it drying out between uses. If we aren't planning to use the filter for a while, we toss the cloth, clean the metal part and let it dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also clean the filter (with or without the cloth) in the dishwasher but I'd still recommend giving it a thorough rinse afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cloths are fairly cheap and in my experience easy to find online so use your judgement - if you think it's time to switch cloths, it's probably time to use a new cloth!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it possible to feel any effects after chewing one coffee bean?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The question title says it all: My colleague wanted to try my coffee, so he grabbed one bean of coffee (roasted) and chewed it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several minutes, he claims, that it has positive effects on him (feels "juiced up)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I am wondering now: Is it just placebo effect, or is there any possibility to feel this after chewing up only one bean?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;First I want to draw a comparison between how much caffeine is in a coffee bean versus a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or a double espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a standard cup of coffee, there is approximately 150 mg of caffeine. In a cup of black tea, steeped for 3 - 5 minutes there is approximately 50 mg of caffeine. In a double espresso there is approximately 60 - 90 mg of caffeine depending on the roast, grind, extraction time, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one dark roasted espresso bean there is approximately 6 mg of caffeine according to &lt;a href="http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/coffee-beans" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this source.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a person is &lt;strong&gt;extremely sensitive&lt;/strong&gt; to caffeine, they would probably be able to feel the effect of 6 mg of caffeine. However, if someone is a coffee drinker, the likelihood that this caffeine is actually affecting them is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your friend never ingests soda, coffee, tea, or caffeine in any form then he &lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt; have felt some of the effects. In my opinion, the majority of the way your colleague was feeling was probably a placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Coming back to this answer, I neglected to mention the effect of the taste of the coffee bean. Taste and aroma can powerfully affect and stimulate the brain. Due to the relatively strong taste resulting from chewing up a roasted coffee bean, this may have also contributed to the reported feeling of stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How does Nel Drip compare to paper filtered Pour Over?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have read about the seemingly involved "Nel Drip" preparation method, and &lt;strong&gt;I'm wondering how Nel Pot preparation differs from regular pour-over or drip methods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've looked at stuff like &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/nel-drip" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this beautiful guide&lt;/a&gt; from Blue Bottle and an &lt;a href="http://www.splendidtable.org/story/patience-practice-key-to-nel-drip-coffee-method" rel="noreferrer"&gt;interview from the same outfit&lt;/a&gt;, another &lt;a href="http://www.turntablekitchen.com/recipes/how-to-make-coffee-using-a-woodneck-drip-pot-and-flannel-filter/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;preparation guide&lt;/a&gt;, some forum posts &lt;a href="http://coffeegeek.com/forums/coffee/machines/634933" rel="noreferrer"&gt;like this one from CoffeeGeek&lt;/a&gt; and others. I also see some other questions tagged &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/pour-over" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;pour-over&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;pour-over&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/339/262"&gt;this one discussing general methods&lt;/a&gt; focused on paper filters, and some over at &lt;a href="http://cooking.stackexchange.com"&gt;Seasoned Advice&lt;/a&gt; but none about Nel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nel Drip preparation differs (from other pour-over/drip) in its apparatus ("Nel Pot"), which itself consists of a cotton / flannel filter loosely hanging or suspended over a glass carafe. It also seems to be called "woodneck" (but this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemex_Coffeemaker" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Chemex&lt;/a&gt;, which also has a wooden bit). "Nel" seems to be stylised as proper noun, but also seems to be short for flan-&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;nel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and is of Japanese origin, though I can't find any proper references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with other brewing methods, there seems to be some kind of romantic fascination or magical mystique about it, and perhaps a "cult-like following" of sorts. I've seen widely varying comments, from the preparation method being fragile or finicky, to "easy, cheap ... incredible" (both from links above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like Nel Drip preparation takes &lt;em&gt;more gear, more preparation, more grounds, coarser grounds, and more maintenance&lt;/em&gt;. There's talk of pre-boiling the filter, bamboo paddles, storing the filter in the fridge or freezer, ...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does it differ (in taste/outcome) from conventional paper filter pour-over/drip?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparation tips that are different from regular pour-over/drip?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaning, maintenance, storage of the filters?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that some with experience can talk me into (or out of!) getting more coffee gear... :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lets answer this question with some data!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://Gastrograph.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;My company&lt;/a&gt; uses machine learning, data science, and sensory science to build flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets use some of our 9,000+ full sensory reviews to examine the difference between Paper Filter Pour-over coffees and the Nel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Nel takes a ton of work to do properly and consistently - but produces a distinct and interesting flavor profile difficult if not impossible to achieve through other brewing methods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;7,371 Reviews of Central American Washed Coffees brewed in Chemex, Beehouse, kalita wave, or  V60 with a paper filter&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Average of 7 day old coffee with a SD of 5 days, the data is evenly dichotomously split between a ratio of 40:600 and 35:400 (up-dose) &lt;code&gt;grams of water : grams of coffee&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;hr&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;2,143 Reviews of Central American Washed Coffees brewed in Nel;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Average of 30 day old coffee with a SD of 10 days, brewed at approx 50g coffee to 180 ml water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Differences in the Beans - before preparation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proper &lt;strong&gt;Nel&lt;/strong&gt; uses old beans, usually a month past roast - &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off/166#166"&gt;often considered stale!&lt;/a&gt; This is a historical antecedent - fresh coffee was hard to come by when the dutch we're the only trading partner (for some time, and the only one shipping coffee) for Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pour-Over&lt;/strong&gt; Methods produce the best flavor profile using fresh coffee (less than 14 days from roast, on average). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Differences in Preparation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nel:&lt;/strong&gt; Very high coffee to water ratio, hovering around ~50g coffee to ~200g water. Very slow pour. It should take at least 6 min to pour the water through the grinds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pour-over:&lt;/strong&gt; More standard coffee to water ration, often around ~40g coffee to ~600g water. Standard pour rate, with total brew time around 4 min. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Differences in Flavor Profile&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles of &lt;em&gt;Central American Coffees&lt;/em&gt; below: &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee options for those with a weak stomach?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My stomach doesn't take coffee kindly for some reason, but I do like the taste and smell of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any coffee types out there for those with a similar issue?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Preparation method will have a big factor in extraction, acidity (such as in @Patrick's answer) among them.  The method used (temperature, time, technique, filtering method) will have a big impact on what comes out in the cup. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astringent"&gt;Astringency&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste#Bitterness"&gt;bitterness&lt;/a&gt; might also be factors that have physical effects for you; see &lt;a href="http://www.coffeeresearch.org/science/bittermain.htm"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; for a discussion of the differences between the two, causes, and related factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try cold brew.&lt;/strong&gt; Cold brew coffee will have lower acidity, and might be a good option for you; &lt;a href="http://www.specialty-coffee-advisor.com/coffee-brewing.html"&gt;here's an article&lt;/a&gt; that discusses different preparation methods, but in the cold-brew section it has an anecdote of someone with similar "stomach".  Here's &lt;a href="http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/how-make-cold-brew-coffee"&gt;another on cold-brew and acidity&lt;/a&gt;. See also the &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/cold-brew" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'cold-brew'" rel="tag"&gt;cold-brew&lt;/a&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper filtering&lt;/strong&gt; seems to remove some acids, but it's not clear whether these are the type that might argue with your stomach. For example, &lt;a href="http://aerobie.com/Products/Details/AeroPressFAQ.htm"&gt;The AeroPress FAQ&lt;/a&gt; claims that their paper filter creates lower acidity brew, but I can't immediately find a better, proper reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try some antacid.&lt;/strong&gt; If you're experiencing heartburn, try a calcium-based antacid before and/or after drinking the coffee, and see if that changes things. (Disclaim: This isn't medical advice, don't take it if you shouldn't, talk to a doctor about meds, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science!&lt;/strong&gt; If you're into thicker scientific reading, here's &lt;a href="http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/125/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00217-013-1917-x.pdf?auth66=1423742173_f2bd9090ce696bb06eb8b37334874b92&amp;amp;ext=.pdf"&gt;a paper on extraction methods and outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, if you're into that sort of thing. It discusses various aspects of acids and acidity. It looks pretty dense.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I keep slime from collecting in my drip tray?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My espresso machine has a pretty impressive drip tray, at just around 1.5 liters in capacity, it holds quite a bit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, if I empty it only when full, the bottom part of it has this really slippery, rather slimy surface which is extremely difficult to scrub. To be clear, it comes off easy enough, but tends to collect in nooks and corners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried adding a cap full of vinegar to the tray after cleaning and replacing it, this didn't make a noticeable difference. Even if I empty the tray when it's half full, there's still a bit of build up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything else I can put in the bottom of the tray that wouldn't come with any competing odors to the coffee I'm brewing, but help keep this (as far as I can tell) 'water gunk' from forming? I'd &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like to avoid dumping and cleaning the tray daily, as it is a bit of a chore. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If what you're seeing is mold or algae you may want to add a few table spoons of salt to the drip pan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing that your slime is probably a fungus of some kind, rather than an algae. It has found a rather nice living arrangement for a fungi. Plenty of warm water and decomposing coffee, with very little light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt should in most cases prevent fungal growth, this may sound odd but it will dehydrate the cells even when they're immersed in water, sort of a "water, water everywhere but not a drop to drink".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would rather get high tech with it, you could try a UV light, similar to the ones used in AC systems. The harsh UV rays will kill most molds and prevent them from colonizing.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the difference between Melange and Cappuccino?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Melange is the most popular coffee beverage in Vienna, Austria and surrounding. It's preparation and look is in my humble opinion exactly the same as Cappuccino. You use an espresso shot, create some milk foam, add the hot milk together with the milk foam on top. Some will sprinkle some cocoa or cinnamon powder on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is it only the name or is there any deeper difference that the customer do not see?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Melange describes different beverages with coffee in different places. The Melange from Vienna is indeed very similar to Cappuccino. However, Melange is sometimes not produced using Espresso, but normal filter coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Switzerland, in contrast, Melange is made with whipped cream instead of milk.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why is drinking Espresso in the afternoon fine, while milk coffee is not?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have often heard and seen, especially in Italy, recommendations to avoid coffee with milk like Latte or Cappuccino in the afternoon, while Espresso is widely consumed during this time of day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the reason for this? Why would one avoid milk-based coffee drinks during the afternoon?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is a cultural issue, not a health one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, rich, big coffee drinks like a cappuccino are drunk in the morning in Italy with breakfast whereas espresso is what is drunk in the afternoon. The reasoning for this is that you can take your time and savor a cappuccino in the morning because presumably you are not at work yet, but in the afternoon you are just in and out for a quick energy infusion on a 15 minute break and you don't have the time to drink anything but a shot or two of espresso. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In America people tend to do just the opposite or just drink what they want, when they want which can lead to some judgement when visiting Italy. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What variety of coffee berries are good for jam?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Some people make jam out of coffee fruits, and I would like to try that out. It seems difficult, as it requires getting actual fruits, and as fresh as possible---probably even harder out of the Green Belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What variety of coffee should I order?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of background: The jam idea comes from reading a story around the 2014 barista selection to represent the U.S. One contender partnered with a Venezuelan coffee farmer, whose mother was making traditional jam with coffee. That's how I got into searching more.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;After much chatter about this question, I must admit that I've become a little obsessed with this concept. Maybe a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; obsessed...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concept.&lt;/strong&gt;  I see three other possible ways of making a &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/451/262"&gt;jam/conserve/preserve/marmalade/jelly/...&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;em&gt;coffee fruit&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., coffee berries / coffee cherries) or &lt;em&gt;coffee cherry husks&lt;/em&gt; (by "husks" I mean basically the fruit with seeds removed -- everything &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; the beans), in decreasing order of actual coffee fruit content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the whole fruit (possibly with seeds and all), so as to make a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves#Conserve" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;conserve&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make something like a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves#Jam" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;jam&lt;/a&gt; or marmalade, using the shredded, dried, rehydrated husks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infuse the husks as &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/451/262"&gt;cascara&lt;/a&gt;, discard the spent husks, then make a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves#Jelly" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;jelly&lt;/a&gt; out of the resulting brew (tisane).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclusions.&lt;/strong&gt; Note that I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; including &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_jelly" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;coffee jelly&lt;/a&gt;, which is made of (conventional, roasted) brewed coffee, as noted previously; also &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; including making a jam out of roasted or un-roasted coffee &lt;em&gt;beans&lt;/em&gt; themselves. Both of those are interesting concepts, but discounted here to be left as separate topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress!&lt;/strong&gt; I searched a bunch for a source of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; coffee cherries or dried husks. Amazon didn't even seem to sell any (must have been my error!?). I asked around at a few local coffee shops, with little progress. I found a few pages, &lt;a href="http://blog.kathrynmcgowan.com/tag/dried-coffee-cherries/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; and one from &lt;a href="http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/grass-fed-pop-some-coffee-cherries" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a NYT blog&lt;/a&gt; that gave a glimmer of hope that husks (at least) could be found. Both of those articles point to &lt;a href="https://counterculturecoffee.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Counter Culture Coffee&lt;/a&gt; as selling these, but they're not in stock. An immensely helpful person from CCC pointed me to &lt;a href="http://www.vervecoffeeroasters.com/collections/coffee/products/cascara-coffee-cherry-tea" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Verve Coffee Roasters, who sell coffee cherry husks for cascara&lt;/a&gt;. So as to get my lot before the rush on coffee cherry husks that would undoubtedly come from this post, I ordered some. Since I'm having trouble being patient and waiting for the stuff to arrive, I started...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeking Seasoned Advice!&lt;/strong&gt; With all due credit to OP @EricPlaton, I posted a question over at &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Seasoned Advice&lt;/a&gt; about the concept of &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/54942/25286"&gt;making jam or preserves out of coffee cherry husks or whole coffee cherries&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote a comment about this above, but I still hope OP doesn't mind!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the process for brewing egg coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There was recently a question about the &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1509/what-is-the-background-of-brewing-coffee-with-eggs"&gt;history of brewing coffee with eggs&lt;/a&gt;, but what is the actual process involved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there different receipies from different cultures? If so, what are they?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I decided to give this a shot and made up a recipe myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out by simply making a press pot of coffee:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vcDo4.jpg" alt="french press"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then, after letting the coffee cool and steep for a few minutes, mixed up and &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/4208/how-do-i-temper-an-egg"&gt;tempered&lt;/a&gt; two eggs (shell and all) by spooning in some of the coffee and grounds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b5Mf7.jpg" alt="tempering the eggs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part starts to look pretty nasty, but persevere:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iRGCK.jpg" alt="tempered eggs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whip the eggs into an emulsion (or close to it; this will be much easier with a whisk), and pour them into the press pot. Once you're done you should have an eggy crema on top (I think I needed one or two more eggs for the entire press pot):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LYITX.jpg" alt="egg coffee"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, it just tastes like coffee (the egg is hardly noticeable, and just tones down the flavor a bit like cream or milk). Using one or two more eggs (for a full pot like this) would probably have helped. Also, make sure you let the coffee cool enough before tempering your eggs, or you'll just wind up with scrambled egg floating in coffee despite the fact that you tempered it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How should I make multiple batches quickly with a moka pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I made three batches in a row with a moka pot (for Vietnamese coffee ice cream!) recently. I did my best to handle things with a wet rag while still hot, but it was still a bit of a pain and a bit slow. Is there anything else I can do to speed things along or make it easier? Is it safe to just run water over it to fully cool it down?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Here's what I do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boil a kettle with as much water as you're going to need for everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill the sink with cold water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your pot of coffee as normal: using boiling water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you've made the coffee and poured it out, dunk the pot in the sink of cold water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should cool down within a few seconds, allowing you to unscrew it, clean it out, and reset (it helps if you have a second sink to do the cleaning in)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill with coffee/boiling water again, and repeat until everyone has coffee&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief summary, taken from &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/36356/25286"&gt;@PatrickSebastien's answer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use water at whatever temperature you like to drink your coffee at, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use water just below boiling, around 95-99 degrees Celsius (~205-210 F). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other articles &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Better-Tasting-Instant-Coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;like this one from WikiHow&lt;/a&gt; also recommend using filtered water that is just off the boil.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's The Difference Between Paper and Long-Lasting Filters</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Lots of people use lots of filters for drip- or filter-brewed coffee. Some use paper and others use these durable filters. The performance to me is the same but many people argue that. They do have their pros and cons as said this &lt;a href="http://www.welovecoffeemakers.com/permanent-coffee-filter-vs-paper/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. So paper filters are easy to use and bad for the environment and long lasting filters last longer and are more environmental friendly... The site has somewhat decent amount of information, but not a lot of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the significant differences between long-lasting filters and paper filters for drip or filter coffee?  &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; Permanent filters win on cost over time. Paper filters win on performance, clean-up, and health. Flavour is personal preference. Composting paper filters and spent grounds alleviates most of the environmental benefit of permanent filter.  &lt;strong&gt;My conclusion: paper filters, discarded into a compost pile, win hands down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use of permanent versus one-time-use filters is a perennial question, with both concrete and personal-preference arguments. In addition to the link in the original post, there are a few other online articles with comparisons, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[1] pretty good &lt;a href="http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-filters-information.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;pro/con overview from air-n-water&lt;/a&gt; (obscure?);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[2] from &lt;a href="http://worldofcaffeine.com/2011/06/20/filter-drip-coffee-paper-vs-metal-filters/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;World of Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[3] from &lt;a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/281062-health-effects-of-gold-coffee-filters/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;LiveStrong&lt;/a&gt;, which advocates permanent filters (but has other statements with which I disagree);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[4] from &lt;a href="http://www.melitta.com/en/Why-We-Filter-1662.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Melitta&lt;/a&gt;, but this may need a grain of salt, because they're in the business of making paper filters :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From those and my personal experience, I extracted an overview and conclusions, below. Unfortunately I've written &lt;em&gt;a lot of text&lt;/em&gt; here, but there's a lot of facets. I've focused basically on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;paper versus metal mesh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as the most common types; I maintain the conclusions are similar regardless of material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material.&lt;/strong&gt; There are several materials used for permanent filters, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metal mesh (stainless steel or "gold tone");&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nylon (or other plastic) mesh;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perforated metal (thin metal sheet with holes);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fabric (e.g., flannel, muslin, hemp).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these surely have different properties, but properties that I focus on here are common to most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One-time-use filters are predominantly paper, but could also be bamboo, natural fibre, or other material. See also &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare"&gt;this question for a comparison of brown versus white paper filters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance.&lt;/strong&gt; Paper filters are a finer filter; a permanent filter will permit some larger particles through to the cup. I find that a pot brewed with a permanent mesh filter will have a fine silt of coffee grounds at the bottom. For this same reason, some recommend to use a coarser grind for permanent filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper filters are also claimed to filter out some compounds (e.g., diterpenes such as &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/414/262"&gt;cafestol, which may increase blood cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;). Coffee brewed by other (non-paper-filter) methods have a higher concentration of cafestol in the resulting beverage.  See article [2] for more health claims of paper filters. On the other hand [3] says that paper filters filter out some &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; things, such as antioxidants, but I haven't seen that claim anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavour.&lt;/strong&gt; Link number [4] claims better taste on paper filter than permanent filter (I happen to agree).  Permanent filters should also allow more oils to pass through, which will certainly have an impact on flavour; this is probably personal preference. The grit that passes through will also have a bittering effect over time, but probably not significant if you're drinking right away. Some (e.g., [1]) say nylon/plastic mesh will retain off-flavours over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost.&lt;/strong&gt; Varies greatly, but one can find permanent filters that are said to last for "years" for a few quid ($/€/£) up to 20-30 quid. Though dependent on usage and other factors, you'll have reasonable expectation of saving money over time by using a permanent filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean-up.&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly, the spent grounds from re-usable filters must be cleaned out; paper filters and their spent grounds can be pitched wholesale.  See another question about &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1518/do-i-need-to-clean-my-drip-brew-coffee-makers-filter-every-time"&gt;how often and how much to clean a permanent filter&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, [3] claims that permanent filters are cleaner, but I don't agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waste / environmental issues.&lt;/strong&gt; I couldn't find any data on how much energy is used to produce a paper filter versus a reusable filter, but many uses would certainly be necessary to break even! As far as waste volume though, you'll make up the difference with paper filters pretty quickly (but composting the paper instead alleviates this!). Cleaning permanent filters additionally requires water and detergent. Though, you may wish to &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use"&gt;rinse your paper filters&lt;/a&gt;, so water use is debatable. Ultimately, reusable filters will eventually wear out and need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt; For my money, personally, &lt;strong&gt;I prefer the paper filter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better flavour and texture (less bitter, less grit);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convenience (easier to use and keep clean);&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>What is the idea behind serving espresso with a lemon peel?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've seen espresso served with a lemon peel next to it, just wanted to know if there was a specific reason for this.  Theories I have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its flavor, specifically the oil that can be squeezed out, complements the flavor of espresso, although if this is the case I'd like to know why.  It would seem counter intuitive to me that you would want to add more acid to an acidic beverage, but I guess milk is slightly acidic too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its flavor covers up imperfections in bad coffee and/or poorly prepared espresso.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is simply a garnish to make the presentation more appealing to the eye.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe one more more of these contributes to serving espresso with a lemon peel?  Maybe something else?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is espresso pre-infusion included in total brew timing?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There are many espresso recommendations for an exact brew time of, lets say 28 seconds according to &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/203/976"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When pulling a shot of espresso, some machines use a low pressure "pre-infusion" feature to quickly bloom the puck before starting the brew cycle. Most coffee brewing techniques do not count this as brewing time since its a preliminary step before adding more water, however espresso is an art of careful attention to every small detail without any room for error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should the timer start as soon as water hits the puck, no matter the circumstances, or should pre-infusion be excluded from total brewing time?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Based in my experience, the "23-28secs" starts counting since you press the button of the water.
Those 3-4secs of "pre-infusion" that you mention, are part of the whole timing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But remember, it will always depends on your set-up (type-of coffee, roast, grind, etc...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can measure this empirically watching brewing guides, like:&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Which of these espresso variant contain more caffeine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Can you please explain what is the difference between these types of coffee
and which one of them contains more caffeine then the others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Espresso &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lungo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ristretto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And please if it's possible to tell the percentage of caffeine of each one.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Lets's do some &lt;em&gt;Espresso math&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking an espresso&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as base unit, we can conclude:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A ristretto&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; uses less (typically: half as much) water than an espresso for the same amount of grounds. This means the amount of water for one serving will flow through them faster, meaning less caffeine can be extracted. (But a ristretto is quite aromatic as mostly the quickly soluble compounds get drawn out.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a lungo&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; it's the other way round, resulting in more caffeine per serving. (Typically resulting in more "bitter" compounds present.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An americano is an espresso "thinned" with hot water, resulting in the same caffeine amount than an espresso - because that's what went in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the caffeine per serving would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ristretto &amp;lt; espresso = americano &amp;lt; lungo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This does not consider that all these drinks can be made with double or triple shots, but the math stays the same.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;For completeness and as the question came up in comments: According to the &lt;a href="http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Istituto Nazionale Espresso Italiano&lt;/a&gt; an espresso is made with 7g coffee per 25ml cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On naming:&lt;br&gt;
The terms for coffee varieties all contain an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis_%28linguistics%29" rel="noreferrer"&gt;ellipsis&lt;/a&gt;, effectively omitting the word &lt;em&gt;Caffè&lt;/em&gt; (coffee):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Espresso means "expressed", referring to the preparation method where water is pushed with high pressure through the grounds, as opposed to coffee from a &lt;em&gt;Caffettiera&lt;/em&gt; or made by other methods. (Other sources claim it stands for "explicitly", meaning a cup that was prepared individually for every single guest or serving. "espresso" is the past participle of two italian verbs. Perhaps a happy coincidence.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Ristretto means "restrained". Easy to remember if one keeps in mind that in the old espresso machines water was pumped manually with a long lever - one lever "pump" resulting in one cup of espresso. If the movement was restrained: voilá, a ristretto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Lungo means "long" - see details above.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are the flavor characteristics of under-roasted coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;As a frequent coffee drinker, I can tell when the coffee beans have been over-roasted; the coffee is bitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I tell when the beans have been under-roasted?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does under-roasted coffee taste like?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I suppose under-roasting and over-roasting are somewhat relative. I generally prefer a lighter roast (just after the completion of first crack) which might be under-roasted to some tastes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've occasionally stopped a roast too early and then it's under-roasted to me (and I suspect anybody else) as well! In those cases, the coffee tastes sour and I don't mean acidic, but sour. The sourness is a little like the taste in bread that has got old and soured. It also has a taste that's reminiscent of tea. I like tea but not when when it's meant to be coffee! (If you've ever had Qishr - "tea" made from the dried coffee cherry husks - it's pretty close to that, which is not surprising I suppose.)
There are also other coffee tastes which are just absent from under-roasted coffee - there is simply less of that "coffee" taste (and it also disappears of the tongue very quickly) and the coffee also has less body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they are not too under-roasted, I find letting the beans rest a lot longer than normal can help a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia lists coffea arabica as a plant species with a high theobromine content, but does not include coffee on the list of significant dietary sources. I searched around, and it looks like the theobromine content in coffee is essentially zero. How can this be? Is all the theobromine contained in parts of the plant other than the beans? Maybe it is removed by the extraction process?&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Does there exist a coffee which is not bitter?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I love the smell of coffee. I enjoy eating coffee chocolate. However I am unable to drink straight coffee, because it is so unbearably bitter for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, no-one is compelled to drink coffee - and I'm perfectly fine without it. However so many people enjoy this drink so much, and it would be nice if I could experience the same pleasure. The fact that I like the &lt;em&gt;flavour&lt;/em&gt; of coffee (as when eating a coffee-flavoured sweet) tells me that if only I could find a variety of the drink which did not include the bitterness, then I would enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have asked this question of several people over the years, who have suggested that I try latté, for example - however the fact that the coffee is diluted by a large amount of milk does not solve the problem. It means less flavour - and yes, less bitterness - but the bitterness is still there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was recommended to try an Ethiopian coffee called Bukeela. I was told that this was especially weak, and that I might be able to take it. So.. I tried it. I added lots of sugar. However it was still too much for me. Yes, the coffee was weak - but that just meant that the flavour was weaker. The bitterness was still present, and still made me unable to drink it. The sugar did not help. It simply meant that I had two tastes in my mouth simultaneously: sweet: but still bitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: the related question on this site regarding "sweet coffee" does not address my question. Sweetness isn't the same thing as non-bitterness. As stated here, even if I add lots of sugar, I just get 2 tastes simultaneously: sweet and bitter. The bitterness is still there. That other question doesn't mention bitterness at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that my taste buds are &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; sensitive to anything bitter. I can not drink beer, and I dislike certain vegetables like broccoli and Brussels sprouts, because of their bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question for all you coffee experts is: does there exist a variety of coffee which retains the yummy flavour, but which has &lt;em&gt;no trace&lt;/em&gt; of the unpalatable bitterness?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;To answer this shortly, no there is no coffee that has no bitterness. Bitterness in coffee is determined by different factors on which I will elaborate a bit now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all there are bitter substances naturally in coffee. The most obvious and widely known one would be caffein. However in truth only around 15% of the bitterness in coffee comes from caffein. There are hundreds of active substances in coffee, some of which are bitter. Most importantly are chlorogenic acids. They contribute most to the bitterness. So it is unlikely that you will ever find a coffee that has no trace of bitterness at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are however some influenceable factors that contribute to bitterness. I want to address first the roasting process, bean type and origins and then preparation methods and some tweaks that might help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; 1. &lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/9514-chemists-find-coffee-bitter.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Roasting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I've said before, key to how bitter coffee tastes are the kind of chemical compounds found in it. And the roasting process determines exactly this. When the beans are heated chlorogenic acids are broken down into first acid lactones and later in the roast process into phenylindanes. Chlorogenic acid itself is not bitter, but the compounds it breaks down into are and especially phenylindanes. As they appear later in the roasting, darker roasts tend to be more bitter than light roasts. So my advice here would be to try very light roasted beans. Here's another &lt;a href="https://www.perfectdailygrind.com/2017/12/bitterness-coffee-always-bad-or-not/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; that also refers to some of the other points I'm making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Bean type and origin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of Beans, Arabica and Robusta with Robusta containing both much more caffein as well as chlorogenic acids. Thus stay clear of Robusta or mixed coffees, since it will add extra bitterness to your cup. Also in my experience light roasted african coffees, e.g. ethiopean or kenyan coffees are the mildest coffees when it comes to bitterness, but do have more acidity than central or south american coffees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Preparation methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, avoid espresso. Because of the pressure applied to the coffee much more bitter compounds are extracted. A general rule of thumb is that with higher extraction you will extract more bitter compounds, that quickly dominate the flavor of the coffee. The bitter compounds are usually extracted at later stages of the extraction process, thus the shorter your extraction the less bitterness. I would suggest you try pour overs, as extraction can be controlled very well and they are just by design made for a cup of coffee with a brighter, more acidic flavor. V60 or even better a Chemex are your best options. The thick Chemex paper will filter more of the bitter compounds and leave more of the acidic, fruity, floral flavors. There are plenty of instructions on youtube or also here in the forum. Avoid overextraction due to a too small grind size, too high water-grounds contact time and too hot water (around 94°C would be perfect, you can go a bit lower however). Additionally make sure you have a good grinder that produces a consistent particle size. If the variation is too big (the downward variation in this case) and if the grinder produces too many fines (very small coffee particles), they will be over extracted and add bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Possible tweaks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a pinch of &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/coffee-add-salt-not-sugar-better-flavour-taste-cup-caffeine-bitterness-sodium-a7675916.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt; to your coffee reduces bitterness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use freshly roasted whole bean coffee from your local specialty coffee shop (you can recognize them because they usually offer a variety of pour over methods and have a generally kind of hipstery look) as preground packs of coffee tend to be over-roasted to mask the low quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grind fresh, with a good grinder and even filter out the fines (just sift it through a fine mesh filter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly you could look for a specialty coffee shop that offers whole light roasted decaf beans. Although caffein only plays a secondary role, it still is bitter and removing it might help reduce bitterness.
Of course there are other factors such as the water for example. However the answers there are not as straightforward and the influence arguably less than the above mentioned ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this can help you in your quest for finding a coffee that you like. I suggest you also go to some local roasters and talk to them. They might be able to help you, suggest coffees etc. and who knows, maybe you can even interest one of them in experimenting with roast profiles that minimize bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What factors affect espresso crema?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;For a given coffee and roasting method, what factors of the espresso making process affect the crema and in what way(s) do they affect it? By my own empirical evidence, I would guess that time since grinding, coarseness of the grind, and tamping pressure are the biggest factors.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso#crema" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The "crema" is produced by emulsifying the oils in the ground coffee into a colloid, which does not occur in other brewing methods. 
  &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UK772.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using the right material from the start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think this definition could use some updating. Crema exists because of the freshness of the coffee, in relation to it's roast. It contains the gasses we find from roasting, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen gasses. You will notice that if you dig up coffee that is months old and brew it as espresso, there will be little crema. Bottoml ine, if you want crema, you need fresh coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Extraction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other factor in producing crema, is correct extraction. If you have a poorly extracted shot of espresso, it will be primarily water, with some seriously over-extracted coffee. An even extraction will produce the highest yield of crema.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coming from Germany myself I have seen this rating only on a single brand of coffee. There is no standard for this (even though us Germans seem to like standardizations), but basically strength of the coffee is about the inherent bitterness and caffeine content you get out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stonger a coffee the more caffeine and also the more bitterness you will usually get.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Milk quantity and consistency in cortado, cappuccino and latte</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am often asked whether these three drinks have the same milk quantity and/or consistency and where the difference really lies between these preparations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would assume that quantity is increased respectively (cortado &amp;lt; cappuccino &amp;lt; latte) but some claim that there is more milk in the cortado than the cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the consistency, wouldn't the cappuccino have a more foamy milk than the other two?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's a chart for that!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href="http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0211/4926/files/PopChartLab__Expresso_Large506.jpg?1290" rel="noreferrer"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to it, but I've also included an image below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be some argument over cappuccino vs. latte as to which is "creamier" as the cappuccino certainly has more mil foam, but the latte has much more milk by volume and by ratio. On the whole though I'd say the latte is a less strong drink with a creamier texture even if the cappuccino is thicker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from being able to smell the coffee is there another purpose to this? I would've thought that it would be better to not have a hole at all and that it should be air tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tAzpR.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems the hole at the bottom is probably for degassing but I have seen on some packages that they call this an aroma hole.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's actually a one-way valve &amp;amp; it's critical to the shelf life of the coffee and the preservation of the bag itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When coffee is fresh roasted, it releases carbon dioxide. It's basically a by-product of the roasting process. When the coffee is ground, carbon dioxide is released expeditiously. If you simply place fresh roasted coffee in a completely sealed bag, the bag will expand and in most cases rupture.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Home roasting and ventilation</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been home roasting with a Gene Cafe since early this last summer.  I chose the Gene Cafe specifically because it appeared to be designed for attachment to a permanent vent solution.  However, I've since found that the three inch exhaust is a very rough fit and that the chaff collector leaks smoke as well.  The vent hole I have installed in my house is also less than optimal since it tends to leak cold air in quite a bit even with two stops installed.  Does anyone have a setup in place that has very little (or better yet, no) smoke leakage when roasting?  What are the elements you have involved to create your smoke free roasting apparatus?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I finally noticed that the chaff collection unit is actually several pieces that don't fit as well as they could.  I took it apart and sealed the seams with high temperature engine gasket sealant.  I then used the sealant to connect the vent hose to the top of the chaff collector (also a very rough fit). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have some problems with cold air inflow on the vent through the house wall, but I can disconnect the vent hose from the house vent and stuff it with rags or other temporary insulation material if I choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All said and done the machine is leaking far less than half the smoke it was previously.  It seems the chaff collector was a main part of the problem.  This makes sense as the exhaust there is making a 90 degree turn, expanding into a chamber, then compressing back into another pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:  &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FIJzw.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FIJzw.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complete misunderstanding of the problem.  The exhaust vent is sized down and WILL connect and properly seal on a piece of exhaust pipe fitting.  I am not sure why the company sized it this way, but sealing the seams and using a piece of exhaust joint (rather than slipping the vent hose/pipe over the exhaust) works like it was probably designed to.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a post explaining the process: &lt;a href="http://www.padhuskitchen.com/2012/05/south-indian-filter-coffee-how-to-make.html"&gt;http://www.padhuskitchen.com/2012/05/south-indian-filter-coffee-how-to-make.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So from the above site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put 3 tbsp of coffee powder in the upper container, fix it on top of the lower container and tap the container gently, so that the powder will settle evenly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bring water to rolling boil and pour it over the coffee powder. Close it with a lid and leave it undisturbed for 10-15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coffee decoction will get collected in the lower container (See picture 3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boil milk and simmer for a few minutes stirring continuously. Pour needed decoction in a cup and add milk and sugar to taste. If you want it strong, add more decoction, if you prefer mild coffee, add less decoction. Serve hot and frothy in tumbler and davara. Enjoy the aroma and the taste of South Indian filter coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>What is the basic differences between espresso, cappuccino, and latte?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm just getting into the coffee world, and I'm assaulted with words such as latte, espresso, etc. What are the basic differences between coffee preparations like espresso, cappuccino, and latte? Is the difference a matter of coffee-to-milk ratio or are there other aspects involved such as bitterness, acidity, caffeine amount, and serving size?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm going to assume that you've had an espresso. It's a small-cup of coffee extracted under very high pressure. It's delicious by itself and some like to add sugar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is a latte?
Take a shot of espresso and add steamed milk &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a cappuccino?
Take a shot of espresso and add steam milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what's the difference between a latte and a cappuccino? Are they the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. (Unless you're in a really bad diner in which case you shouldn't be ordering lattes there.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several differences between a latte and a cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is the ratio of milk to espresso. A cappuccino is 1-1 milk to espresso and the latte is 2-1 milk to espresso. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another difference is that the milk is treated differently. In a latte the milk is heated as opposed to being frothed. In a cappuccino the milk is frothed (converted into a microfoam) to about double it's original volume. (If you've ever heated or foamed milk you'll have noticed how the milk changes state as it's being heated.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the way the milk and espresso are combined is different. In a latte the heated milk and espresso are poured together into a serving cup. Whatever microfoam might have been created while heating the milk is then poured over the top. In a cappuccino the frothed microfoam is poured over the espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets more involved than this but I'll let others answer those questions. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee in a flask - How long can I store?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In the past I have made up to 2L of coffee using a french press and stored it in a flask that I have brought to lectures. Sometimes I will continue drinking this after 5 days, but it tastes pretty bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two related questions: Is it bad for my health to drink after two weeks? Does it lose caffeine over time?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are a few factors at play here. The temperature that the coffee is brewed at and how well the flask holds that temperature are primary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the coffee stays hot the caffeine level will decrease. The speed will depend on the temperature and the amount of caffeine to start with (which is thoroughly discussed in other questions here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the coffee cools bacteria growth will start. At what point this bacteria become dangerous not only depends on temperature but also how clean the flask was to begin with and what quality water is being used. Clean tap water in the US, brewing coffee in a very clean french press, and placed into an incredibly clean flask could last two weeks (although it would taste terrible and have little caffeine) but if any of those steps is less than ideal there is a good chance of bacteria growth. Some people's guts will handle that bacteria without a problem, other people may get sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I should point out that as I have researched more I'm less certain about the statement regarding caffeine levels over time. Caffeine should not burn at any temperature coffee is left at, and it does not evaporate. So either experiments that say caffeine levels decrease are wrong or the reason it decreases is not clear. Some suggest that bacteria eats the caffeine, which does tie into why it becomes less safe to drink over time.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it necessary to sort beans after roasting?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;After roasting, the beans colour is usually uneven. Most of the beans have the desired roast, but some are burnt, and some have visibly lighter colours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people sort every single bean after every roast. It is impressive work and result, but also tedious. I believe that is necessary for the look of the beans in a retail shop. Some other people sort just a little to remove really &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; beans (i.e. burnt).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are criteria / conditions to sort beans?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder about taste: A tiny number of beans with different roast should not impact it, but I lack experience to know.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It will affect the flavor. Whether that's particularly noticeable depends on the bean, the roast you're going for, and how &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; variance there is in the roast. Whether it &lt;em&gt;matters&lt;/em&gt; to you is a personal decision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, over-roasted beans are worth removing from a light roast (I tend to prefer city roast at darkest), even if they're not actually &lt;em&gt;burnt&lt;/em&gt; - the flavor of even a few dark beans will tend to overwhelm the more delicate flavors of a lighter roast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I use a popcorn popper; there tends to be a lot of variation in the results. If you have a better roasting setup, you can probably avoid a lot of the hassle. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Will coffee taste different from a cup with lid (blocking the smell)?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I know that as much of our perception of flavour is down to smell as actual taste. When I get a take-out coffee with a lid, am I losing all of the smell that I would get if I drank it out of an open-topped vessel, and does this affect the taste?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the full taste should I remove the lid before drinking it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes.  You should remove the lid for maximum effect.  Somewhere around &lt;a href="http://dwb.unl.edu/teacher/nsf/C10/C10Links/ericir.syr.edu/Projects/Newton/11/tstesmll.html"&gt;three quarters of our perception of taste comes from smell&lt;/a&gt;.  There are varying figures out there, but most are fairly high.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, much of that comes from the olfactory sense when the molecules pass from our mouth to our sinuses.  So, having a stuffy nose is more likely to reduce the taste of your coffee than drinking it with the lid on.  That being said, the aroma from brewed coffee tends to dissipate fairly quickly, so you might only need to leave the lid off your cup for the first few minutes of your "coffee experience". &lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between a long (luongo) and a short (ristretto) shot of espresso?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a difference in grind, extraction time, amount of coffee used, temperature, volume of water?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If so, what are the differences?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A long (luongo) and a short (ristretto) shot have two key differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of coffee used virtually stays the same although it can increase slightly with a ristretto shot, as the grind is finer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key similarity between these two shots and a normal shot is that the &lt;strong&gt;extraction time stays the same&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The grind is altered&lt;/em&gt; to achieve this - coarser for a long shot and finer for a ristretto shot.  This, ideally, alters the volume of water which can pass through the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long shot, the volume should be &lt;strong&gt;twice&lt;/strong&gt; that of a standard espresso shot and for a ristretto shot, the volume should be &lt;strong&gt;half&lt;/strong&gt; that of a standard espresso shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temperature of the water remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does adding salt to coffee reduce bitterness?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Although this was kind of asked in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/14/127"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;, it was as a side-question that wasn't really answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've heard people say you should put salt in coffee to reduce bitterness. Does this actually work? If so, why?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The fundamental science seems to be: &lt;a href="http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/6/609.abstract" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sodium salts suppress the perception of bitterness&lt;/a&gt;. It specifically mentions caffeine, which is one of the bitter components of coffee. This &lt;a href="http://chemistry.about.com/od/foodchemistryfaqs/f/Does-Salt-In-Coffee-Reduce-Bitterness.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;About article&lt;/a&gt; lists a few more references to the same thing: The sodium ion works by "interfering with the transduction mechanism of [bitterness]."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is, it's a change in &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt;; e.g., the salt is not chemically changing the bitter compounds, just interfering with the bitterness receptors in your tongue. Conversely, the article seems to suggest that the bitterness doesn't reduce the perception of saltiness; this to me suggests that your coffee will taste salty. &lt;em&gt;Caveat emptor!&lt;/em&gt; There's a bit more discussion on the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste#Saltiness" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;saltiness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste#Bitterness" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;bitterness&lt;/a&gt; sections of the Wikipedia article on taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question from &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/9292/25286"&gt;Seasoned Advice&lt;/a&gt; discusses the same and provides some additional links.

  <title>How should I clean a stainless coffee carafe?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;At the office, we have a coffee maker with a &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0001IRRL6" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;stainless steel vacuum carafe similar to this one&lt;/a&gt;. It has accumulated coffee residue in it from 5+ years of hard service, whilst receiving in return what I shall politely call "inadequate cleansing." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a double-wall vacuum container. There is no heating element, so I'm not exactly sure what causes this buildup in the first place. The &lt;a href="https://www.cuisinart.com/share/pdf/manuals/dtc-975bkn.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;manufacturer user manual&lt;/a&gt; suggests to clean using dish soap / mild detergent, or the top rack of a dishwasher; I've tried both, neither worked. I have also tried scrubbing with non-abrasive brush, sponge, and dish detergents; improved, still lots of residue. I soaked in two batches of near-boiling water and bicarb (baking soda) for about an hour. The first rinse looked almost like brewed coffee; this was &lt;em&gt;shocking&lt;/em&gt;. After all that, the situation was improved but there's still lots of residue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are myriad suggestions for removing coffee &lt;em&gt;stains&lt;/em&gt; from stainless steel, like &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Remove-Coffee-Stains-from-a-Stainless-Steel-Pot" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this set of eight (8) from Wikihow&lt;/a&gt;. It suggests exposing the inside to various household chemicals: vinegar, baking soda / bicarb, bleach (!?), salt, ice cubes, etc. This &lt;a href="http://www.simplyorganized.me/2012/08/how-to-clean-stainless-coffee-pot.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;other article suggests using a &lt;em&gt;dishwasher&lt;/em&gt; detergent tablet&lt;/a&gt; but it uses anonymous tablets. It does give a nod to using dishwasher detergent powder (as I did &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/51953/25286"&gt;with this other device&lt;/a&gt;), but I'd prefer to know what is the actual cleansing chemical at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So before I either abandon this (decidedly serviceable) carafe for a new one, or begin indexing my pantry for candidate chemicals: &lt;strong&gt;How should I clean this stainless carafe?&lt;/strong&gt; Surely someone must have had and solved this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition: I'd also like to ensure that I don't make this worse in the process; e.g., scratching or etching the inside of the carafe. Are these carafes predisposed to buildup? What's causing it? Besides regular cleaning, is there anything else that will keep this thing cleaner for a longer period of time?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Tannin is a chemical contained in coffee and this is what normally stains your coffee making / drinking equipment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using an espresso machine it is advised to 'backflush' your machine with cleaning powder which cleans away a build up of 'tannin' from inside the machine. I expect a similar thing has happened to your carafe. With an espresso machine you're advised to do it weekly with heavy use - so I can imagine an "inadequate cleansed" carafe would probably be heavily tannin stained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can purchase tannin cleaning powder from any coffee supplier, such as &lt;a href="https://www.happydonkey.co.uk/machine-cleaning/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Happy Donkey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it is designed for Espresso Machines - it is perfectly safe to dissolve the powder in water and use it to clean other tannin stained equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to increase your caffeine sensitivity?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been drinking coffee for a long time and over the last few years I've noticed that my sensitivity to caffeine has dropped significantly. Nowadays, it basically has no effect whatsoever - I can drink double espressos and go to sleep right away and I also don't feel anything after drinking multiples of those. According to this &lt;a href="http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-sensitivity"&gt;http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; I guess that I've become hyposensitive to it (probably due to the abuse of all the coffee machines at my workplace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn't always like this - I even used to use it as a preworkout while I was studying (in large quantities, but still). &lt;strong&gt;My question is whether someone has had the same problem and managed to increase their sensitivity. If so, how and how long did it take?&lt;/strong&gt; There are some tricks using grapefruit juice with coffee because of narangin which improves caffeine absorption or using fat (bulletproof coffee) for the same reason &lt;a href="https://www.bulletproofexec.com/the-4-secrets-of-getting-wired-on-caffeine/"&gt;https://www.bulletproofexec.com/the-4-secrets-of-getting-wired-on-caffeine/&lt;/a&gt; (I haven't tried these yet). The usual suggestion is to stop using it for a while, but after a month of doing so nothing changed. How do you get the kick back? I'm in the last year of my PhD and I need it...&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Over the years I developed a caffeine addiction that reached fairly severe levels.  For background, the addiction ramped into high gear the summer after my freshman year of college (summer of '99) when I was consuming somewhere between 60 and 100 ounces of coffee per day.  I tried to quit cold-turkey once, and spent two weeks mostly bouncing a rubber ball off the wall of my dorm room before I decided the addiction itself wasn't even that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I needed to do something about it, and I went with the only logical method: I &lt;strong&gt;slowly&lt;/strong&gt; backed down my consumption, from about five to seven cups per day at the time to a hard limit of two.  I also forced myself to stop consuming any coffee after about 11:00am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did all this over a six-week period.  That kept the headaches away, and decreased my dependence on the drug.  However, I had to maintain at that level for several more months -- probably about six or so -- for my sensitivity to caffeine to go back up.  Now, when I drink a cup in the morning, it has the desired effect: it perks me up and prepares me for my day.  It's no longer a crutch, it's simply a pick-me-up I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary: back down your caffeine intake, whatever the delivery method you prefer, by 10 to 20 percent each week until you reach a more manageable level, then hold at that level for several months.  That will increase your sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Blade grinders: any advantage over burr grinders besides cost?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There are many blade grinders in the market, and they are usually cheaper than burr grinders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've almost always heard and read that burr grinders are the best choice for most of coffee preparations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is there any advantage —besides cost— for blade grinders compared to burr grinders?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You can use a blade grinder for nuts and spices as well, provided that the 'chamber' and blades are 100% stainless steel. It's pretty easy to clean the oils that would otherwise affect your next batch of beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not the case with a burr grinder, especially the ceramic variety - a hand-full of hazelnuts in one of those will mean &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; coming out of it picking up that taste for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use my blade grinder mostly for that these days, since I own several burr grinders. Great at grinding up peanuts, dry corn kernels, dry spices and that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clean it, I wash it with a moist cloth as usual and then use a moistened antiseptic towelette (like they use to wipe your skin with prior to giving you an injection) - there's no trace of what I just ground in it once I'm done.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How long will cold brew keep?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;After making a big batch of cold brew, I'd like to be able to keep it around for an extended period of time-- one month, let's say. Assuming I keep it in an airtight container in the refrigerator, how long will my batch of cold brew remain fresh, flavorful and bacteria-free?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From anecdotal experience freshness and flavor begins to fade within ~7 days with regular storage methods&lt;/strong&gt;. Many people brewing cold brew online state between 5 days and 2 weeks is okay to keep cold brew for. In my opinion you will have coffee that you won't want to drink long before you run into harmful bacteria &lt;em&gt;as long as you are keeping things sanitary&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How you store the coffee will determine how long it keeps&lt;/strong&gt;.
To improve storage look into bottling it in individual bottles with little headspace, or even kegging the coffee. Exposing coffee to oxygen will negatively impact flavor and expose coffee to more bacteria. Creating a concentrate of the coffee may help to prevent bacteria from forming. Splitting batches up into multiple sterile containers and keeping them sealed may also help it to last longer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting your coffee to last you a full month is almost definitely going to be much more of a hassle than brewing coffee more frequently.&lt;/strong&gt; The taste will always be better from fresher coffee and cold brewing coffee is one of the simplest methods. Unless you absolutely can't make coffee more frequently I would recommend making smaller batches you can consume quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Hario V60 Plastic Dripper vs Ceramic Dripper: Is there any difference in brew quality?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am planning on purchasing a V60 and was wondering if there was any difference between the brew produced by the plastic and the ceramic Hario V60? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The main difference between the ceramic and plastic V60 is heat retention. The ceramic will retain heat and can be pre-warmed, creating a stable temperature. Depending on who you are this may not make a huge difference but I prefer the ceramic as I feel the plastic sucks some heat out of the water/coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other reason I prefer ceramic is for cleaning purposes. The ceramic is nonporous and I've used mine for 6 months with no residue or stains whatsoever. The plastic can form build ups from minerals in water or coffee and start to appear visually unappealing (not sure if it will affect flavor of coffee)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plastic V60 is obviously more durable and resistant to bumps and minor drops, so it can be a portable solution for coffee. However the ceramic V60 is the most visually appealing of the V60's (in my opinion) and it stays at my home on the counter so I prefer it. I believe the grooves inside the brewer and the size of everything is identical, so you can't go wrong with any of them. &lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have been drinking Bulletproof coffee since 2012 now, so made a few of them.

My wife and I use one called Magimix and it revolutionised how the coffee looks and tastes. So speed is the key. I haven't found a difference by adding the butter or oil in a certain order or way into the blender.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What quantity of ground coffee should I use for an automatic drip machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;It seems like a fairly basic question, but there's probably some more science to this. &lt;strong&gt;For an automatic-drip coffee machine, how much ground coffee should be used per unit water?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various sources say that the "industry standard" is 7g (~1 rounded Tbsp) per "cup" (150-175mL, or 5-6 fl.oz.). Is this uniform for any (reasonable) amount of coffee (say, 200mL-4L / 1 cup to 16 cups)? Or would I want, say, a higher ratio of grounds-to-coffee for making 2 cups, than for making 12 cups? I feel like I, personally, tend to use &lt;em&gt;more coffee&lt;/em&gt; (per unit water) when making &lt;em&gt;fewer cups&lt;/em&gt; (I'm not sure why; shorter extraction time? Matters of water retention? Mere personal preference?). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely this also depends on total extraction time and grind level, but perhaps that is a separate question. With due credit, this question was partly spurred from &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1894/optimizing-the-office-pot"&gt;this recent question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think you have already listed the "industry standard" that is the answer to your question.  It is a good starting point for anyone and the amount can be adjusted by taste afterwards (more grounds for stronger coffee, less for weaker).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount may vary with brewing method of course, since depending on the method, brew components (grounds, filter, other components) may retain various levels of water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one add on I will stipulate is that it is always better (for groups) to brew coffee that is too strong.  It is very easy to add some hot water to a cup and weaken a cup of coffee,  however, if you like strong coffee and it's been brewed weak, you are just out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why must the milk be frothed?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Nearly every coffee machine has the milk go through this device which not only heats it up but causes it to froth up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this important for a coffee? What's wrong with just heated milk?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's not that &lt;em&gt;just heated&lt;/em&gt; milk is wrong or tastes bad.
It's only that there are some (popular) coffee drinks that uses &lt;strong&gt;steamed&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;frothed&lt;/strong&gt; milk (are not the same, read &lt;a href="http://www.gaggia-usa.com/skills/steaming-vs-frothing/nav/60" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) by traditional way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On those popular drinks you can find the cappuccino, latte, etc... (as you can see on this &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PaN3b.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;infographic&lt;/a&gt;), but at home you always can add regular hot milk to your coffee (but we all agree that it isn't feel and taste like the regular way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, why are those techniques important for a coffee? I think that gives a different flavour and tasting to the drink, due to its consistency (and of course, that let you to do some pretty nice latte art)&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Does anyone have experience with this brewing method?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The question here is about the following primitive method for making coffee. Having used this method for many years now I think it gives consistently good coffee, comparable to that from a good espresso machine but without the need for machinery or paper filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recipe:&lt;/strong&gt; Bring one cup's worth of water to a boil in a small pot. Add about a scoop and a half of ground decent-quality beans to the pot. Swirl gently until chalky bubbles appear. Filter through a tea strainer into a cup. Let stand briefly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No need to grind the beans to a powder. The tea-strainer gets most of the grounds and the amount of sediment in the cup is about the same as in cafe espresso. The only electric component is a coffee grinder. Using pre-ground beans requires more coffee per cup, as some flavor will be missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general this method produces coffee that is slightly weaker than espresso. While I might add a bit of sugar to espresso to counter bitterness if the beans are old or mediocre, the strainer method above gives coffee that is very drinkable without sugar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sometimes surprises me that this simple method isn't more widely used. &lt;strong&gt;Has anyone else tried it?&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any drawbacks to this method? It isn't worth much commercially because it only makes decent coffee one cup at a time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method is adapted from one I saw used by fisherman in Brazil, except he used a sock instead of a tea strainer. Comments welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The biggest drawback is that you might add the grounds to too hot water. Especially avoid adding the coffee to water that is still boiling. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_preparation#Boiling" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has some references about the temperature and it states that boiling water will extract bitterness instead of aromatic oils. So just make sure to wait a moment after taking the water off boil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second drawback is that since the grounds remain in the pot in contact with the water, you have to empty the pot entirely once the coffee is "done". Leaving the grounds in contact with the water for longer times will only add betterness to the coffee. Of course this is no problem if you only make one cup, but prepare to have a (pre-heated) container ready if making more cups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to the second drawback is that the extraction will continue in your cup because of the sediment, but in my opinion most people will not even notice it affecting the cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6242467/ns/health-heart_health/t/coffee-cholesterol/#.VbiFUPnsT3w" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Coffee oils make it to the news&lt;/a&gt; from time to time. Since this coffee is not paper filtered it contains more oils. Some like the taste, some do not. Some link coffee oils to cholesterol levels (I do not..), which might be a personal drawback to some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offtopic: the method you describe is actually how my granny makes coffee, with a little twist (that I dislike). After adding the grounds, she heats the water to boil &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; and quickly removes it from the stove after first signs of boiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Just wanted to mention that none of the drawbacks I listed is unique to this method.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is wrong if my espresso pours out slowly but the first drops shoot out?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've recently bought my first espresso machine (a Rancilio Silvia). I'm now trying to dial it in, but don't know how to interpret the result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My shot is not too fast (it does not splash out of the machine). It also takes about 5 seconds until coffee starts pouring out. However, the coffee does not flow as evenly as I was expecting. The first drops really shoot out of the machine and then turn into a quivering stream of coffee. In the end, the cup is not clean at the rim but rather a bit sprinkled with coffee drops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I tamp too hard or why does this happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GyzB8.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GyzB8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Looks like you've got &lt;em&gt;too much ground coffee&lt;/em&gt; in the basket. What's the weight that you're using? It looks like the recommended dose for the stock basket is 14g, which is a bit lower than the "standard" of 19g or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have an indentation (ring) around the outside of the grounds -- an indentation from the group/dispersion screen (in addition to the notorious protruding center screw on this model). If you're already tamping thoroughly, this could mean you've got too much coffee in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a thread &lt;a href="http://www.home-barista.com/tips/puck-indentation-with-stock-rancilio-silvia-portafilter-basket-t16349.html"&gt;from Home-Barista on the Silvia&lt;/a&gt; around a similar topic. It discusses another way of diagnosing the dose -- inserting the PF with tamped grounds, then removing while still dry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That article also talks about aiming for a dose+tamp to leave a bit of space between the tamped grounds and the screen: approximately the thickness of a 5-cent piece of space (1-2mm), which is a general recommendation (not just for this machine), though there is certainly disagreement on this. Another article from &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/07/coffee-tools-the-espresso-tamper-how-to-tamp-correctly-barista-tips.html"&gt;Serious Eats discusses this topic&lt;/a&gt; and notes that a "sludgy mess" can result, because the grounds will expand a bit when they absorb water. Your picture also looks a little "wet"; it could just be the picture, or perhaps a similar symptom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try a lower dose (14g) and do the dry-removal test, aiming for a bit of space between the top of the tamped grounds and the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Should I grind my coffee beans at home, or en masse in the coffee shop?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I bought a pack of New Orleans' PJ's whole bean coffee. It is a bit old, about a year. I am flexible type though, I'll drink it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is my indecision about whether to grind it piecemeal or just all at once. I have a cuisinart machine that works quite well. But it's for a small amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious as to the best way to ensure somewhat fresh cups. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;That's pretty straightforward: if you're not too lazy and have the equipment at hand, always grind only the amound needed just before brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/166/277"&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt; for impressive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if your beans are year old already, this might not make a huge difference --- but there's no way that grinding it all at once could help you have ``somewhat fresh cups''.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>How should I order an espresso to get a less sour shot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I often find that standard espresso shots at many high-end coffeeshops to be more sour than I prefer. I tend to order straight espresso, or Americanos with only a little water, or maybe a macchiatto, so there's not much fat to cut the tartness. What should I say to get a less acidic shot?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Here's a few thoughts based on what causes sourness/acidity in coffee and ways to temper it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Order an &lt;em&gt;espresso lungo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Sourness (acidity) is characteristic of the "stuff" that is extracted relatively early in the brewing process. In other brewing methods that take longer to perform (e.g., coffee press, drip, or pour-over) this can be balanced by the more bitter notes that take somewhat longer to fully extract. For this reason, you might get a result that is more appealing to you by ordering an espresso that takes longer to pull, i.e., espresso &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo"&gt;lungo&lt;/a&gt;. Not everyone behind every coffee counter will be immediately familiar with this, but at good cafes with good machines an espresso lungo should be no problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try a &lt;em&gt;darker roast&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Darker roast coffees tend to be less acidic than lighter roasts, at the expense of losing more of the varietal/regional notes. Many cafes have really only one bean/roast that they use for every espresso (often because of the practical considerations of having several grinder hoppers full of beans), but if you have an option, try a darker-roasted bean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try beans from a &lt;em&gt;different region&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; To my taste, Indonesian coffees tend to have less pronounced acidic notes than African or American coffees. Again, if multiple coffees are available for espresso, pick a coffee that you like (or find less sour) for any other preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick beans further off of the roast.&lt;/strong&gt; This is really only for completeness, but beans that were &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; freshly/recently roasted (i.e., less than a few days) can have accentuated acidity because some undesirable volatiles haven't yet had a chance to leach out. This is more toward what @daniel noted; this is the kind of thing &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; shouldn't need to be concerned about at a cafe -- &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; should!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cafe affiliated with a local roaster (or any specialty cafe) should be able to tell you lots of things about the coffee when asked, such as region, varietal, roast level, and roast date. Here's a &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/07/home-coffee-brewing-troubleshooting-grind-size-brew-time.html"&gt;Serious Eats article about "problems"&lt;/a&gt; and related solutions that touch on some of the things I talked about above. Here's another link from &lt;a href="http://www.coffeecuppers.com/CoffeeTastingGlossary.htm"&gt;Coffee Cuppers about regional and roast considerations&lt;/a&gt; in general.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why is a cup of coffee not 6 oz.?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;According to Google, a cup is 8 oz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_%28unit%29#Metric_cup" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;According to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, a cup of coffee as measured on the coffee maker is only 5.07 oz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every brand of coffee I buy shows directions for 1 tbsp. per 6 oz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why is a cup of coffee only 5.07 oz when nobody (that I know of) uses a cup that small? In fact and in most establishments, you can't even buy a &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; cup of coffee that is less than 8 oz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this just a conspiracy so that the coffee maker companies can exaggerate their capacity while the coffee companies dupe people into using too much coffee per cup, or is there another reason?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not just make it 6 oz?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Do not blame the coffee makers for what has always been an ambiguous measure - or rather, not a unit for measuring at all. Only in some areas of the world a &amp;quot;cup&amp;quot; has evolved into a fixed unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, a cup is a drinking vessel for usually hot beverages and usually with a handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How big&lt;/em&gt; a cup is, is primarily a cultural thing. To showcase two extremes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An espresso cup (&lt;a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;source: Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yL69b.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yL69bm.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vs. a jumbo coffee mug (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.in/Francois-Mimi-14-Ounce-Colored-Ceramic/dp/B0090UTJNK" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;source: Amazon&lt;/a&gt;) :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NsbNK.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NsbNKm.png" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am from Germany. We typically use [ml] for volumetric measurements. Whenever I come across a recipe quoting &amp;quot;cups&amp;quot; I start my research: Where did it originate? Is it from the US? I use 245 ml. From current Germany? Probably 200 ml. From my Granny's time? 150 to 180 ml probably fits the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar rues apply for coffee, from a small espresso or mokka cup in southern Europe or the Arab world to a mug of filtered coffee in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be one correlation though - the &amp;quot;stronger&amp;quot; (=more concentrated) a coffee is customarily prepared, the smaller the cup. The amount of ground coffee per &amp;quot;serving unit&amp;quot; seems surprisingly constant for the various preparation styles - about a heaping teaspoon per &amp;quot;cup&amp;quot;. The rest is a matter of taste.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Well if you put it into a fridge, all you are doing is slowing down the process. Cold brew is one of the hardest things to mess up if you ask me, so I would just brew it room temperature. If you extend a brew process in time - than you generally have a larger interval of time where the coffee will still taste great, but since it's already hours long I really wouldn't worry about it. All the shops i've ever worked at brew room temperature. Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it good to have the "floating oil" on the surface of some coffee drinks?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Coffees prepared with some standard home machines (e.g., non-paper-filtered methods like moka, Turkish, or even some espresso machines) have something on the surface. It looks like oil from the beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filter-based brewing techniques like drip or Aeropress do not result in this oil film on the surface, in my observation. The filter is probably the reason, as it can block the oil and just let water get through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This oil, if confirmed, is what contains most flavour compounds, so I guess we want to keep it. On the other hand, it is aesthetically nicer to have a clean surface for the coffee drink, which means to act such that this oil is excluded at brewing time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure there is a tradeoff here, as "clean" surface coffees are very good (if prepared well), which means the flavour compounds did get down to the drink. So perhaps the surface oil is just that does not participate to the flavour. Any information on this topic?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The amount of oil in your coffee correlates to what is called the "body"? This is the "fullness" that you feel of the coffee in your mouth. Like the difference between a light cake and fudgey brownie. More oil means more body. You get more body from brewing methods which, like you said, do not use a filter. This includes things like french press. The amount of oil/body is also influenced by the beans you use, with darker roasted coffees generally having more oil/body. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people probably wouldn't say a cup of coffee without oil looks any nicer than one with, because there's nothing wrong with it, just a different variety. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Warm Brew Coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I usually hot brew coffee as it's the most convenient method. I occasionally cold brew coffee for a less bitter coffee, which I prefer, but is a bit of a pain in the a***.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming the bitterness is caused by the breakdown of a protein in the coffee bean at higher temperatures. Are there any coffee experts or chemists out there that know what's going on here? I'm wondering if I can use a thermal circulator and water bath to minimise brewing time and bitterness while maximising flavour and caffeine extraction from the beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone tried this or does anyone know the science and theory behind it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Well I'm a chemist, but I can't say I'm an expert at scientific coffee extraction; take what I've got to say with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you are extracting something into water, the temperature plays a couple different roles. First, higher temperatures generally increase the solubility of &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; compounds. Higher temperature water generally means more of everything gets dissolved, good and bad.Using cold water doesn't entirely solve the problem, since the lower solubility can leave a lot of great flavors behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher temperature can cause the breakdown of proteins, but I would doubt this is a significant source.After all, the beans were already roasted at high temperature before you ever got to the brewing part and the majority of the breakdown probably happened there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you've got the right idea with circulating water at some intermediate temperature; you'd probably get the best of both cold and hot brew after you play with the temperatures a bit to find the best one for your tastes. The lower the temperature, the more flavors left behind and the longer you may have to brew to get to an adequate strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do decide to try it, let us know how it works!&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Because the taste and aroma are horrible. I've been places (for instance Shanghai and Beijing) where it's hard to get a cup of coffee outside of business areas catering to foreigners. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to order Caffe Macchiato and be sure you get one?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I think this question pertains mostly to the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I travel often and like to stop at local coffee shops. My beverage of choice is a Caffe Macchiato. In the US, there seems to be the issue that a "Macchiato" at Starbucks is something different from an actual Macchiato. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia, this is what I consider a Macchiato:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Caffè macchiato, sometimes called espresso macchiato, is an espresso coffee drink with a small amount of milk, usually foamed.
  [...] The caffè macchiato has the highest ratio of espresso to milk of any drink made with those ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have run into this a few times, even at coffee shops that seem to make a big deal about their coffee knowledge etc. I order a Macchiato, and receive a huge cup with mostly milk and some espresso. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to be clear as to what I want when I order, but I also want to avoid sounding like a jerk if I specify exactly what I want, or sounding dumb if I describe the drink rather than ordering by its name. What is a good way of achieving this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The problem with ordering a "Macchiato" is that it's only &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; of the name of a traditional coffee drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Macchiato" means "stained" or "flecked" and not more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Italy, you have either &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latte macchiato:&lt;/strong&gt; *Milk "stained" with coffee (more precisely caffè or espresso) or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Espresso macchiato:&lt;/strong&gt; Espresso (or caffè) "stained" with a spoonful of milk foam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you order a "Macciato" without qualifier, you will either get what the chain defines as such (for Starbucks, a lot of milk and foam with one or multiple shots of espresso) or what your barista thinks of first - and that would often be a (&lt;em&gt;latte&lt;/em&gt;) macchiato, i.e. a glass of milk and foam with an espresso layer inbetween. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my recommendation is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a serving of espresso with a bit of milk, order an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;espresso&lt;/strong&gt; macchiato&lt;/em&gt;. I just double-checked with the Starbucks US website and yes, they do have espresso macchiato on the menu. Any decent barista from the (self proclaimed) high-end places you mention should be familiar with these terms anyway. The fine difference between "coffee" and "caffè" (see below) might be "lost in translation" and they will be using an espresso machine in 99% of all cases anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comment re. your Wikipedia link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note the spelling: &lt;em&gt;caffè&lt;/em&gt; is not the same as American &lt;em&gt;coffee&lt;/em&gt;! The former is what you get when you use a stovetop &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot" rel="noreferrer"&gt;moka pot&lt;/a&gt;, which creates a brew similar (but not identical) to espresso. Both are served in rather small serving units and for coffee drinks used somewhat interchangeably. Espresso shots in a bar or coffee shop, caffè often in a domestic setting (no need for fancy machinery).&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I own a drip coffee pot:
&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H0sqP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and one of the other things you can buy is a &lt;a href="http://www.hario.jp/product/list.php?middelclass=3" rel="noreferrer"&gt;thin spouted kettle&lt;/a&gt; which is used for pouring water one to the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the theory behind this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the rate of water delivery/flow just agitate the suspension of coffee/water in a way that is better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also see such items being used in coffee shops too so would really like an expert's summation on this.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;By having a thin spout, you can more finely control the flow rate and where the water lands.    When making pour-over coffee, you want to control the water level in the cone to control the brew time and evenly extract coffee.  Also, water needs to be poured carefully onto the middle of the cone so that the water doesn't run down the side of the cone without touching the coffee grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why do barista's keep activating the doser whilst grinding coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I notice that some barista's keep whacking the doser on the coffee grinder when they fill the espresso holder. What's the theory behind this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would've thought that the fact that the coffee is being ground and falling into the holder that it is being aerated enough already so why do this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be something to do with specific grinder models, it may be just the lever to release coffee, I don't know but would like to hear from someone who knows better than me.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short reason:&lt;/strong&gt; Tradition conflicting with modern brewing practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long reason:&lt;/strong&gt; This is more a result of an industry-wide legacy when purchasing equipment, where coffee shop owners will pick up mechanically dosed grinders instead of doserless, or electrically metered models because "that's how it's been done," or because the technology simply wasn't  affordable until simple microcontrollers became cheap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Traditionally,&lt;/em&gt; you would grind enough coffee to fill the doser, dispensing grounds for brewing as needed and refilling the doser when the level dropped too low.  Dosers exist to allow for predictably size quantities of grounds to be dispensed into the portafilter, and that's basically it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, however, conflicts with the "Third Wave" coffee culture, where flavor and texture are paramount.  In this new culture, coffee beans are ground for immediate use, rather than drawing from a bin.  The moment beans are ground, the gasses contained within (gasses that are the reason Crema exist) are allowed every opportunity to escape.  The longer they sit, the less gasses will be left behind by the time they're used to brew.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when a Third Wave coffee shop grinds using a doser, the Barista rapid-fires the dosing lever, essentially moving the coffee straight into the portafilter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better plan is just to use a direct-dosing grinder where the grounds are metered by time or weight straight into the filter.  Advances in the packaging options for load cell sensors and simple controllers have made this somewhat common in both consumer and commercial equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How long can I store ground coffee in the fridge?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I ground some coffee beans this morning, but I'm not a major coffee drinker, how fast can I expect its flavour to degrade, and at what point would it become completely undrinkable?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee should never be stored in the fridge!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate#Applications"&gt;baking soda&lt;/a&gt; absorbs smells, coffee will absorb smells and flavors in your refrigerator. These compounds can be extracted when you brew your coffee and will contribute to undesired flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proper storage of coffee is to put your beans into an airtight container, and store around 25C out of sunlight (EX: your cabinet). &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I backflush my espresso machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just recently purchased an &lt;a href="http://www.wholelattelove.com/products/ecm-technika-iv-espresso-machine"&gt;ECM Technika&lt;/a&gt; and have noticed recently that my shots have been fairly inconsistent. A friend suggested that I backflush the machine, but didn't have a chance to explain to me exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do that. Can anyone tell me how to backflush my machine? How often should I do this? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Backflushing is a fairly straightforward procedure. You only need &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE1NFgxNjAw/z/fZIAAOxy6MBSSlAz/%2524T2eC16F,!zkFJCOFBk,kBSSl!ys6z!~~60_35.JPG&amp;amp;imgrefurl=http://www.ebay.com/itm/STAINLESS-STEEL-BLIND-FILTER-BACKFLUSH-DISK-/271641948190&amp;amp;h=216&amp;amp;w=300&amp;amp;tbnid=ynq9S5wUZeePwM:&amp;amp;zoom=1&amp;amp;docid=e99XOeBEvG5xzM&amp;amp;itg=1&amp;amp;ei=KhHIVISeIJTnaoXWgfgH&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;ved=0CCwQMygLMAs"&gt;backflushing disc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coffee machine &lt;a href="http://www.greenbeanery.ca/bean/catalog/images/Cafiza_20oz.jpg"&gt;detergent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procedure needs repeating a few times (3-4):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the disc in the portafilter &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add in a bit of cleaning detergent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on the coffee machine until you hear the pump start to labour, once this happens turn the pump off, and the hot water with detergent will spray out of your 3-way valve. This is quite likely to cause &lt;strong&gt;spraying&lt;/strong&gt; so try to be careful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you've done this, repeat the procedure without detergent to flush the soap suds from the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally you would do this &lt;strong&gt;about once a month&lt;/strong&gt;. This is highly dependant on how you feel the machine is doing, but it's definitely recommended that you do this if you use the machine a lot (Some people recommend doing it around every 30th espresso).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this it is a good idea to run one espresso shot through the machine to clear everything out and not leave any residue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How hot should be the water to brew with this method? Should it be boiling, or a lower temperature?&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Your method most closely resembles &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_coffee"&gt;Turkish Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, which is suggested to be served at hot, &lt;strong&gt;but not boiling&lt;/strong&gt; temperatures. Since the exposure to the grounds is so direct, it's easy to burn the coffee at boiling temperatures. You want a full body, but not a burnt taste (yuck!) &lt;a href="http://www.turkishcoffeeworld.com/How-to-make-Turkish-Coffee-s/54.htm"&gt;Turkish Coffee World&lt;/a&gt; recommends about 158 degrees Fahrenheit or 70 degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to prevent calcium loss when drinking a lot of coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm recently drinking a lot of coffee at work. I'm worried about the health issues - lost of calcium from the bones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I prevent calcium loss? Drinking coffee with milk is out of option for me - I'm lactose intolerant.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Apparently, drinking caffeinated beverages shouldn't affect you calcium level if you get your recommended daily intake of calcium. According to &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12204390" rel="nofollow"&gt;this review&lt;/a&gt; of the literature on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no evidence that caffeine has any harmful effect on bone
  status or on the calcium economy in individuals who ingest the
  currently recommended daily allowances of calcium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there does seem to be a connection between high caffeiene intake and low calcium intake, meaning that there is significant overlap between individuals who drink caffeinated beverages and don't get enough calcium from their diets, but implying a causal relationship is dubious. Luckily,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;...the negative effect of caffeine on calcium absorption is small enough
  to be fully offset by as little as 1-2 tablespoons of milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most milk alternatives (like soy or almond milks) are fortified with calcium and other nutrients and drinking them in place of milk should do the trick, just be mindful of the high sugar content of many of the milk alternatives available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I wouldn't worry about your daily coffee dose, 1.4 billion cups of coffee [&lt;a href="http://www.streetdirectory.com/food_editorials/beverages/coffee/coffee_consumption_around_the_world.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;] are poured every day and if there were serious health risks associated with daily caffeine ingestion, we'd know about them!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Generating Crema with a manual machine</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a La Pavoni Pro, and noticed that I am a bit inconsistent with the crema. I have read &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/9/what-factors-affect-espresso-crema"&gt;this other post on crema&lt;/a&gt; and understand the freshness of the beans are the most important part, but I have noticed even with the same beans my crema is not the same. There are a lot of variables with the La Pavoni, tamp, grind, pull, temperature of the machine etc. What variables should I should focus on after considering the freshness of the beans?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You should make sure that the coffee runs through with at least 6 bar pressure. If your pressure is below that value, you won't get a crema. The recommended pressure for Espresso is 9 bar ± 1, according to the &lt;a href="http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Italian National Espresso Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it necessary to allow a shot of espresso to rest before adding it to a drink?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;After making a shot (or multiple shots) of espresso, there appears to be a lot of activity going on. The best I can compare it to, visually, is a pint of Guinness settling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it best to allow the shot to complete this 'settling,' or is this unnecessary as nothing really happens in this ~30 seconds after pulling?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Not necessary in my opinion.  In fact, i prefer to add it as soon as possible.  The activity you describe is the crema dissipating.  I prefer a lot of crema...  if you wait 30 seconds, there should still be decent crema integrity.  By the way, Starbucks trains their baristas to add the shot within 10 seconds of brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these various methods, &lt;strong&gt;are any of them (potentially) harmful to humans?&lt;/strong&gt; Be it short-term or long-term? Which is the safest?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Swiss Water process is the best because it's the most natural and has the best percentage of decaffeination. However, none of the processes are dangerous, I repeat, none. Unless you consume the decaffeinating solvents somehow, that's a different case. -.-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sourced from my previous answer at &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/120/how-is-decaffeinated-coffee-made?lq=1"&gt;How is decaffeinated coffee made?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;This question is in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many cups of coffee can one safely consume each day before first experiencing side-effects?&lt;/strong&gt; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many cups can one consume before it's considered harmful to one's health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is assuming a generally healthy human being of average weight and average height who is not taking any medication.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I would recommend scanning the &lt;a href="http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Substance%20Use%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th edition) on caffeine and coffee addiction&lt;/a&gt;, as well as looking at independent studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance there have been many studies done on the benefits and side affects, both of which can be highly dependent on what type of person you are specifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, caffeine is considered safe for healthy adults, and you should guage your consumption based on what you think fits your lifestyle&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Nespresso Virtuoline long pull vs short pull</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;While using a Nespresso Virtuoline, the machine seems to read a barcode on the capsules which tells it how much water to use.  The high intensity espressos seem to give you a very small quantity (about .3 oz with maybe .2 oz crema).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if its possible to make a long pull with the virtuoline?  Or do the capsules simply not contain enough coffee so it becomes watered down? &lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I've made a little bit research on the &lt;a href="https://www.nespresso.com/us/en/service-faq" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nespresso FAQ&lt;/a&gt; and found the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific extraction parameters are set for each blend and each coffee
is developed from the interplay between the extraction parameters and
the coffee blends to guarantee the best result in-cup. However, the

  <title>What changes need to be made to espresso machine so it can function properly in space?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently read &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2847836/Female-Italian-astronaut-revealed-taken-specially-adapted-espresso-machine-International-Space-Station.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about an Astronatur taking a "specially adapted espresso machine" with her to the space station and using it there to drink coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this makes me wonder, what changes were made to the coffee machine so that it produced excellent coffee even in zero gravity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the article says is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cristoforetti will be able to get her morning caffeine fix after celebrated Italian coffee makers Lavazza teamed up with space food specialist engineering firm Argotec to create a special and lightweight machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which doesn't really give much technical information about the change itself.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I was able to dig up this press release:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.lavazza.com/en/.content/document/pdf/PR_Italian-espresso-in-orbit.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://www.lavazza.com/en/.content/document/pdf/PR_Italian-espresso-in-orbit.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first capsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme
conditions of space is here. It is called ISSpresso and is the
brainchild of two Italian companies — Argotec and Lavazza — in
collaboration with the Italian Space Agency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turin, 13 June 2014 – “An espresso coffee is what I miss most aboard
the International Space Station.” We have repeatedly heard this
comment from the Italian astronauts who for 13 years have been at
times working in the International Space Station, and today their
espresso wish is about to become reality. In fact, Argotec and Lavazza
are working together with the Italian Space Agency (ISA) to actually
bring the authentic Italian espresso onto the International Space
Station. So in the Futura Mission — the second long-term mission of
the Italian Space Agency aboard the Space Station — another Italian
astronaut of the European Space Agency, Air Force Captain Samantha
Cristoforetti, could not only be the first Italian woman to go into
space, but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic
Italian espresso in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Its name is ISSpresso.&lt;/strong&gt; It takes its name from the International Space
Station (ISS), where it is to be installed. It is the first
capsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme conditions
of space, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of
liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth.
ISSpresso is the product of a project run by Argotec, the Italian
engineering company specialised in the design of aerospace systems and
European leader in the preparation of healthy and nutritious foods for
in-space consumption, and Lavazza, the historic Italian coffee brand.
ISSpresso is a veritable technological and engineering jewel, able to
deliver a perfect espresso in weightless environment. This is why it
was selected by the Italian Space Agency to be used aboard the ISS, in
the framework of the Request for Expression of Interest that the
Agency keeps constantly open to public-private partnership projects
and activities to be carried out in the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Italian coffee is a beverage without borders — comments &lt;strong&gt;Giuseppe Lavazza, Vice President
of Lavazza&lt;/strong&gt; — and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into
space for some time. Indeed, as far back as ten years ago we launched
the espresso into orbit artistically with the photographs taken by
Thierry Le Gouès and our Mission to Espresso calendar, which at the
time may have looked like a work of science fiction but was actually
just a vision of the future. In fact, today we are in a position to
overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso — the
indisputable symbol of made in Italy products — on board the
International Space Station. We are proud to have worked on this major
project with Argotec, through the Lavazza Innovation Center, our
division dedicated to research and product innovation: a scientific
and engineering challenge which we hope will improve the living and
nutrition quality of astronauts engaged on long missions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our aerospace engineers — stated &lt;strong&gt;David Avino, Managing Director of Argotec&lt;/strong&gt;
— have designed a new-concept coffeemaker, which is safe for the
astronauts and able to function in microgravity conditions, also
thanks to Lavazza’s experience as a leader in capsule extraction 2
systems. The functional project was already completed in June 2013:
Argotec had been working on it for about one year. This is an ultra
high-tech project which has led to innovative solutions, applicable
with immediate returns on Earth as well. ISSpresso is a technological
challenge that meets very stringent requirements, imposed by the
Italian Space Agency, in terms of technical functionality and safety.
In addition to the engineering aspect, Argotec is also taking care of
the European astronauts’ training and nutrition. Food provides an
important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good Italian
espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed
especially for each astronaut, helping him or her to feel closer to
home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roberto Battiston, President of the Italian Space Agency added:&lt;/strong&gt;
“ISSpresso is a perfect example of the way ISA's decision to make ISS
national usage rights available to public-private partnership
initiatives can result in a valorisation of public resources for
technological, economic, and social objectives. The ISA will bring
ISSpresso aboard the ISS, thanks to bilateral cooperation agreements
with the NASA, as it shares with the project partners the objective of
improving the quality of life of ISS astronauts, as well as the
astronauts who will take part in future long interplanetary
exploration missions. At the same time, we are also proud to
contribute to the promotion of the image and spreading of the
Made-in-Italy brand at international or better “space”, level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A coffee break in space.&lt;/strong&gt; A prototype of the space coffee machine is
currently being tested at Argotec’s laboratories and all the necessary
functional and safety checks. In a subsequent phase, Finmeccanica –
Selex ES will participate in the assessment activities aimed at
launching ISSpresso into orbit with the Futura Mission crew, one of
whom is the Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. The ‘corner
café’ on the ISS will be the hub for socialising on board the Station,
a sort of social network in space, a venue for getting together,
chatting and relaxing: an aspect that should not be ignored in
missions that keep the astronauts away from home for many months in a
very challenging environment. The innovative capsule system will also
be able to prepare not only a regular espresso, but also a caffè lungo
or hot beverages, such as tea, infusions and broth, so that food can
also be rehydrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra-terrestrial technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Every tiniest detail
of ISSpresso is designed to respond to a scientific and engineering
challenge: in fact, the machine studies have enabled principles of
physics and fluid dynamics to be tackled, such as the difficulty of
handling liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space
environment. Just think that the plastic tube carrying the water
inside a normal espresso machine has been replaced with a special
steel tube &lt;strong&gt;designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar.&lt;/strong&gt; The
machine is so complex that it weighs &lt;strong&gt;about 20 kilograms since there
are back-ups of all the critical components for safety reasons in
accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the Italian Space
Agency.&lt;/strong&gt; ISSpresso represents a technologically high-value project
which, besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts’
menu, will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid
dynamics and conditions in microgravity. Some of the solutions adopted
have led to international patents, which will be useful both for
future space missions and immediate terrestrial use...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like its a heavy duty capsule system designed to withstand high pressure that not only makes coffee, but makes tea, broth, infusions and re-hydrates food.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.espressoitaliano.org/en/"&gt;Italian National Espresso Institute&lt;/a&gt; requires the following properties for a &lt;a href="http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;certified&lt;/em&gt; Espresso&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water pressure: 9 bar ± 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percolation time: 25 seconds ± 5 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using a Quickmill Pegaso 3035, and for some coffees I do have a much higher pressure (around 12-16 bar). However, the percolation time is around 25 seconds, the coffee has a good crema and tastes fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any downsides because of the high pressure? Does it alter the taste? Would I get more crema if I reduced the pressure?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A higher pressure is fine, as long as it is a controlled variable. You may have to tamp harder or start with a finer grind in order to accommodate the higher pressure. The increase in pressure otherwise would cause a faster brewing time and ergo underextraction of the coffee puck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's important is that you keep your pressure consistent. An &lt;em&gt;occasional&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;erratic&lt;/em&gt; bout of high pressure makes your yield unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What qualities do I need from an espresso machine or steam wand in order to produce good latte art?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm learning to brew coffee, and one of my aspirations is to be able to brew a good, solid cup of latte, with the milk foamed just right all the way through. I'm getting there, but beyond that point, I want to be able to create &lt;em&gt;latte art.&lt;/em&gt; In a few months, I'll have to buy my own machine to practice on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current machine (a small household unit with a copper boiler) has good pressure for foaming milk, but apparently that pressure isn't sufficient for being able to produce microfoam, which I understand is necessary for good latte art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I shop for a new machine, what qualities do I need from it to be able to properly produce latte art? I'm aware I need an angled wand, but I've heard conflicting reports on the amount of pressure involved and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In my experience, it is difficult to achieve perfect microfoam with a home brewing espresso machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially what you need is a &lt;strong&gt;15 bar pump&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;boiler chamber big enough&lt;/strong&gt; to hold enough steam to have higher pressure and volumes of steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this usually means you need to buy a bigger espresso machine which means it is going to be a bit more pricey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since manufacturers don't always give technical specifications on what size boilers they use, you may have to rely on customer reviews for this aspect. They should always give the strength of the pump though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my own personal experience, the smallest espresso machine with which I have been able to achieve perfect microfoam &lt;a href="http://www.idrinkcoffee.com/Breville_Professional_800_Collection_BES800ES_Espr_p/sa-bre-800es-b5.htm?gclid=CLj7q7qS1sMCFYNAaQodm4MACw"&gt;is this&lt;/a&gt;. However, I was professionally trained in a coffee shop for two years using an industrial machine.  For you, I might recommend that you go up a size or two. Breville is an excellent brand and has good machines that make good foam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, you do want a 360 degree rotational steam wand so you can control your milk. Also, you want your steam wand to just be plain and simple and not have one of those 'frothing helpers' for beginners. Most come with it but are removable. You will need to learn how to control air injection on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Could preparation method make coffee more acidic?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;This is more of a vague feeling than something I'm sure of, but from the many cups I've drunk, I have a feeling that &lt;strong&gt;when prepared in a french press, my coffee tastes a little more sour/acidic, compared to a turkish brew. Is this a documented phenomenon&lt;/strong&gt;, or is it just me? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, assume the same coffee is used both times, which by the way is some home-ground (blade grinder) arabica.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is a perfect follow up to the "&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/66/what-coffees-are-the-least-acidic/181#181"&gt;What coffees are the least acidic?&lt;/a&gt;" question! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, &lt;strong&gt;Lets answer it with some data!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://Gastrograph.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;My company&lt;/a&gt; uses machine learning, data science, and sensory science to build flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Preparation has a significant affect on the flavor profile of coffee - including the level of acidity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Distribution of Acidity by Brewing Method&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bvYFi.png" alt="Boxplot of Sour &amp;amp; Acidity by brewing method"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I may present to you... the distribution of acidity in coffee by brewing method! 
Clearly and without surprise, Espresso (coffee extracted under pressure) is the most acidic preparation method, on average. French Press (full immersion brewing) is the least acidic, and V60 (a type of pour-over) has the widest range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But is there something else going on here?&lt;/strong&gt; 
What if there exists a conflating factor such as green processing, roast level, or growing environment? Some of these questions we're already answered in the link above, so lets focused on the remaining question - how does the origin of the coffee effect the perceived acidity of the coffee by brewing method? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Acidity by Brewing Method Controlling for Continent of Origin&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mie4a.png" alt="Acidity by brewing method controlling for continent"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is the effect of brewing method consistent? No. 
What we're seeing here is that each continent tends towards a different green processing technique, and thus a different optimal level of roast - all of which exert as much influence over the resulting level of acidity in the flavor profile of the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Please just save me from exogenous variables&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh... you should have just said so.... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kmild.png" alt="Inference Tree of Acidity in Coffee"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a conditional inference tree mapping the distribution of acidity scores to a series of categorical variables. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Where:
C is Country 
P is Preparation 
G is Green Processing
and the bar plot shows the distribution of acidity
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Country is clearly the most used variable in creating this tree, and interestingly, Green Processing is only used as a splitting rule when a country has a variety of green processing methods in common use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please leave a comment if you'd like me to add a variable or further analysis to this answer! &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Yemenite tea-like coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was in Yemen a few years ago, and when ordering "Yemenite Coffee" there, one would get a cup with a liquid which tasted like coffee, but from the intensity, color and strength was more like tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was told the coffee was made from the peelings of the coffee beans (because all the beans are determined for export).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it true that they brew their coffee with the peelings of roasted coffee beans? How exactly is this kind of coffee made? Does it have a special name? Are there similar kinds of drinks?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you had &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_cherry_tea"&gt;coffee cherry tea&lt;/a&gt;, also called &lt;em&gt;cascara&lt;/em&gt;, and regionally other names; in Yemen it seems to be called &lt;em&gt;qishr&lt;/em&gt; according to Wikipedia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's (to me) delicious, but rather different than roasted, brewed coffee beans. It has a lovely red hue, similar to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooibos"&gt;rooibos&lt;/a&gt; but lighter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's made by infusing the dried coffee cherries or just the husks (as you described in the question). It is steeped like an herbal tea, in hot water just off the boil. &lt;a href="http://www.benttreecoffee.com/allcoffees/cascara-coffee-cherry-tea"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; says that it can be brewed using cold-brew techniques also. I've only had it cold/iced or lukewarm, but it is probably lovely hot also. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is coffee a pro-oxidant or an antioxidant?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've heard that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; acts as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-oxidant"&gt;pro-oxidant&lt;/a&gt; which damages cells and tissues causing the long-term effect of shorting life expectancy (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-radical_theory_of_aging"&gt;Free-radical theory of aging&lt;/a&gt;), the opposite of how &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; are thought to work (e.g. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea"&gt;Green tea&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I can't find this information on Wikipedia (e.g. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore is coffee a pro-oxidant or an antioxidant?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In Spain one &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023643804000933" rel="nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica" rel="nofollow"&gt;Brazilian Arabica&lt;/a&gt; 100% (A100) roasted samples &lt;strong&gt;presented lower antioxidant capacity&lt;/strong&gt; (less efficient antioxidants) than &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee" rel="nofollow"&gt;Robusta coffee&lt;/a&gt; varieties (could be due to the higher percentage of chlorogenic acids in Robusta ground coffee than in Arabica) therefore &lt;strong&gt;Brazilian Arabica 100% (A100) presented the highest value of pro-oxidant activity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However &lt;strong&gt;higher antioxidant activity was observed in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production_in_Colombia" rel="nofollow"&gt;Colombian coffees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; than in conventional roasted coffee blends. On the other hand, when the percentage of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrefacto" rel="nofollow"&gt;torrefacto coffee&lt;/a&gt; was increased, an increase of the antioxidant activity and a slight tendency to decrease the pro-oxidant activity were observed. Therefore &lt;strong&gt;addition of sugar&lt;/strong&gt; at the end of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrefacto" rel="nofollow"&gt;the torrefacto&lt;/a&gt; roasting process &lt;strong&gt;may influence the antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties&lt;/strong&gt; of coffee because sugar is one of the main precursors the Maillard reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, we can say that antioxidant and pro-oxidant capacity of ground coffee can be affected by several factors such as coffee variety, roasting process (e.g. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrefacto" rel="nofollow"&gt;torrefacto&lt;/a&gt;), growing climate, storage, etc. The details of the studies for further reading can be found below.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Are there any disadvantages to shade grown coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shade-grown_coffee"&gt;Shade grown coffee&lt;/a&gt; seems like a great way to support sustainable agriculture in forest areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the few examples I have seen these beans seem more expensive than the cheapest brands of bean but it is by no means the most expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what are the disadvantages of shade growing coffee? Does it generally affect flavour in a noticeable way?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I suppose flavor won't be changed. Most coffee beans are grown &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;just like that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. They require shade or they will die of too much sunlight. Having too much water will sometimes drown the plant to death. Here is a &lt;a href="http://www.coffeehunter.com/articles/shade_grown_coffee_agronomist%E2%80%99s_perspective" rel="nofollow"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that lists three main disadvantages and some advantages to shade grown coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too much shade will cause fungal infections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the plant is under too much shade, fungi-related infections will attack and feed on the plant. This will ruin your plant and destroy it. Yet having too much sunlight will burn the plant instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The real definition of shade-grown is not really rock-solid. Many places will have varying amounts of shade due to their altitudes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't say that this type of shade gown plant is used in every country of different altitudes.. Some places require more shade (those with a high altitude) and others less shade (those with a low altitude). It depends on where you will plant your coffee plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The further south (or, north) a farm is located from the Equator, the less need there is for shade cover to protect coffee plants from the rays of the sun: the strength of the sun's rays in, for example, Brazil (where the sun is at an angle) is far less than the direct overhead rays from Central America. Thus, while shade cover may prove advantageous in Central America it might actually lead to a fall in yield of crops in Brazil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This directly copied from the website, word for word. The amount of shade needed will also depends on the sunlight's strength. Nearer the equator, it is stronger so more shade is required. Farther from the equator, it is weaker so less shade is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are maybe more, but these are some basic and critical disadvantages to shad grown planting. I hope this helps you!  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What do the terms extraction and strength mean?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;A number of questions use the terms &lt;em&gt;extraction&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;strength&lt;/em&gt; in a broad sense like "how much stuff comes out of the coffee beans."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But "technically" speaking: &lt;strong&gt;What do the terms &lt;em&gt;extraction&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;strength&lt;/em&gt; really mean for coffee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some selected questions that discuss (but don't define as such) strength and extraction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/44/what-does-the-strength-mean-in-numbers"&gt;Coffee package strength markings&lt;/a&gt; are often just relative to others within a brand;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Though I don't generally like to cite Wikipedia as my primary reference, it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; in this case have a pretty good overview of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_extraction" rel="noreferrer"&gt;terms related to coffee extraction&lt;/a&gt;, re-summarized here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Extraction:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;em&gt;amount of the original mass&lt;/em&gt; of the grounds that ends up in the brewed coffee&lt;/strong&gt;. Though it certainly depends on the preparation method ("method of extraction", e.g., drip, moka, espresso, cold-brew, ...), the recommended extraction amount is &lt;strong&gt;about 20%&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., about 20% of the mass of the beans/grounds ends up in the brewed coffee). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less than ~15%-18% extraction is considered "under-extracted" and can be sour.&lt;/strong&gt; That is, under-extraction is not just a matter of inefficiency: the result can be sour and unbalanced due to the fact that acids are extracted quickly. On the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;more than ~22%-25% extraction is considered "over-extracted" and can be bitter&lt;/strong&gt;, because the bitter compounds are extracted later in the brewing process.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These figures were generated by groups with lofty-sounding names like the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_Coffee_Association_of_America" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Specialty Coffee Association of America&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.scaa.org/chronicle/2013/10/04/the-coffee-brewing-institute/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Coffee Brewing Institute&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.espressoitaliano.org" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Italian Espresso National Institute&lt;/a&gt;. Also known as "solubles yield." See also &lt;a href="http://www.coffeecuppers.com/Espresso.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; on espresso extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strength:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;em&gt;concentration&lt;/em&gt; of the extracted compounds in the water.&lt;/strong&gt; Basically, how much coffee is in the water per unit (volume or mass).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in the question, there are also colloquial or vernacular uses of these terms (e.g., "strength" as relative flavour profile; "extraction" as the process of brewing, etc.) but the above seem to be the accepted tangible definitions of the terms.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The one-way valve, to squeeze or not to squeeze?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I buy 2-3 bags of fresh roasted beans and after a few days the bags balloon out. Should I squeeze the gases out or let the gases seep out naturally? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It doesn't actually matter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The valve on the bag is there to let gas out without letting gas in. The reason for this is that freshly roasted beans will continue to give off a bit of CO2 for a little while. Coffee that's packaged immediately after roasting will give off a bit in the bag, hence the need for a valve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oxygen causes coffee to go off, which is why we keep our coffee in airtight containers to preserve it as long as possible. It's why the valve on the bag is designed to prevent air from the outside getting in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CO2 that's accumulating in the bags is essentially inert, and won't cause the coffee beans to go off. It makes no difference whether you squeeze it out or not!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does coffee heal headaches in some people but causes it in others?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I know that it could be related to the effects of caffeine with blood pressure, but I don't know if there are any other side effects of caffeine itself or from the other chemical components inside a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Different people react to chemicals and stimulants in slightly different manners.  It's entirely possible that the raise in blood pressure caused by caffeine may be exaggerated in some individuals (especially those who are caffeine naive) and cause headaches.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, caffeine may reduce or prevent headaches in other individuals through several &lt;a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijvm/2010/834060/"&gt;mechanisms&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Caffeine is also a common ingredient in many medications used for
  treating migraines, due to the fact that it makes analgesics work more
  efficiently, causes a faster absorption, and allows for a reduced
  dosage which decreases possible side effects of certain analgesics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also possible for people who are caffeine addicted (daily coffee drinkers) to begin withdrawal symptoms if they don't get caffeine/coffee.  One of these symptoms may be headache.  Consuming caffeine again can alleviate these withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to prepare good coffee during an outdoor trip?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am planning some hiking/climbing trips this year so I started looking into portable espresso machines. I found these &lt;a href="http://www.handpresso.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;products&lt;/a&gt; and also this &lt;a href="http://www.wacaco.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;ESPRESSO ON THE GO&lt;/a&gt; (this one actually got me super excited and I'm definitely getting one). No idea what the exact differences are apart from the price - The first one is much more expensive. I was wondering whether there are any old school tricks to prepare good coffee on an outdoor trip that don't require you taking too much equipment with you - I would prefer espresso but I realize that this is probably unrealistic. Also, what type of beans would you take on such a trip and how would you store them?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm going to focus on the "old-school" aspect of your question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my perspective/experience, the classic way of producing "camp coffee" is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_percolator" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;percolator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. To use this device, you put grounds in a basket on the top, water in the bottom, assemble the apparatus, and put it over a heat source (e.g., camp fire, stove, etc.). If you want a stronger brew (as it sounds like you do), you can also use a moka pot (some call this a "stovetop espresso maker", though I don't care for that term) -- there are some &lt;a href="http://www.mec.ca/product/5006-001/gsi-stainless-steel-espresso-maker/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;very &lt;strong&gt;compact moka pots&lt;/strong&gt; like this one&lt;/a&gt; that are targeted for backpacking/camping. This will give you very good moka-pot-strong espresso-like coffee, but you won't mistake it for espresso out of a professional espresso machine. You get the full experience of brewing a pot of coffee in the wilderness, which I enjoy. See also my related q/a on &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/418/whats-the-difference-between-a-percolator-and-a-moka-pot"&gt;the difference between a percolator and a moka pot&lt;/a&gt;. Those are my preferences for camp coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a little more technology, you can use &lt;strong&gt;integrated heater/container systems&lt;/strong&gt; like the &lt;a href="http://www.jetboil.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;JetBoil&lt;/a&gt;; they also have small accessories like this &lt;a href="http://www.jetboil.com/Products/Coffee-Press/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;French press insert&lt;/a&gt; so you can minimize the extra gear (e.g., you can use the setup for heating water for other cooking, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; (separately) use it to make coffee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the extreme end of low-weight and low-technology spectrum, you could use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;instant coffee&lt;/a&gt; or try &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001M05070" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;coffee bags such as these&lt;/a&gt;, which are like tea bags, except that they are filled with coffee. You could even make your own coffee-bags (see &lt;a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Customize-your-own-portable-coffee-bags/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;instructables&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://makethebestofeverything.com/2013/07/diy-coffee-brewing-bags.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;MtBoE&lt;/a&gt;). Though there are tradeoffs and &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/19369/why-dont-we-make-coffee-in-the-same-way-we-make-tea"&gt;reasons you might not want to do this, from Seasoned Advice&lt;/a&gt;. These single-serve coffee bags have the advantage of minimal clean-up, and the whole package may be compostable. Also you don't have to worry about hot gear if you're packing up to get on the trail quickly (e.g., backpacking). Bags and instant are passable, ultra-light substitutes for actual coffee that get the job done but are less enjoyable to drink (for me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storage of beans and/or grounds is tricky -- &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off"&gt;especially already-ground coffee goes stale very quickly&lt;/a&gt;. You can minimize the damage by keeping everything sealed and dry. See also questions about &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1/how-should-i-store-whole-bean-coffee"&gt;storage in general&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1566/how-much-does-keeping-beans-vacuum-sealed-matter"&gt;vacuum-sealing&lt;/a&gt;. You could always use &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1540/why-would-anyone-want-to-hand-grind-their-coffee"&gt;a hand grinder&lt;/a&gt;, but that's more gear and more weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum: &lt;strong&gt;I go "fast and light" for coffee on the trail: gear that's reasonably light, that I can use quickly&lt;/strong&gt; (for me, this is moka pot) so I can get the caffeine-dose done and get back on the trail. Pre-grind the coffee into a zip-top bag and evacuate as much air as possible. Deal with the slightly-stale taste and focus on being outdoors!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What causes the crema in my latte to appear so charred?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My latest attempt at creating latte art (admittedly theres still room for improvement).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, what is causing the crema around the milk to have such a charred look to it?  It isn't immediately noticeable after adding the milk but within a minute after it starts developing that charred appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kcmqQ.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kcmqQm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Hard to diagnose just on the back of a photo, but if I had to guess, I'd say the milk is not "sunk" properly (i.e. the consistency of your espresso is different to that of the milk). This would also explain why the base of the rosetta is a bit "murky". That took me a while to figure out, but I had the same issue (check &lt;a href="https://instagram.com/p/i3JPUrlnjm/?taken-by=stanimiroff"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; out, then compare to &lt;a href="https://instagram.com/p/0SNJKLFnuR/?taken-by=stanimiroff"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;). So in practical terms, avoid wiggling the pitcher before a white "dot" appears on the surface. Only once the white dot appears on the surface and the stream of milk coming from the pitcher has pushed it further into the cup, should you start rocking the pitcher left to right (good example&lt;a href="https://instagram.com/p/0Ar4bWgYos/?taken-by=_chris_mg"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; albeit a different pattern). Hope this helps! &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How long should I steep an AeroPress (inverted)?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been going back and forth between a French Press and an AeroPress for a few weeks now and I can't achieve a great flavor with it yet. I'm pretty sure that I just need to spend more time experimenting so I'd like to ask the community for some advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the optimal timing for an inverted AeroPress with fine ground coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I typically aim to finish plunging at 2:30, using a fine grind and 200F water. But I'm always experimenting when it comes to the Aeropress, and would probably have a different answer in a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it helpful when I first started with the Aeropress to try out some of the recipes from the &lt;a href="http://worldaeropresschampionship.com/recipes/"&gt;World Aeropress Championships&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why are commercial coffee machines significantly more expensive than consumer machines?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to understand what causes a commercial coffee machine to be more expensive than a consumer system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, a coffee machine consists of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boiler, for the hot water (around 65 °C).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temperature sensor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pump/motor to get the pressure (around 10 bar). (cost: \$390-\$520 USD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valves and pipes (to the boiler, from boiler to extraction point).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pressure gauge, for the coffee extraction . &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relay, measuring the extraction length (around 25 sec).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Precise Temperature, Pressure and Extraction-Time control, via some kind of embedded system, say micro controller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chassis, to hold all the parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee Taste(Temperature, Pressure, Extration-Time, Coffee Beam Crop) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it about the components or implementation that make commercial systems more expensive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there something different about the manufacturing process (and therefore price) of each of the separate components?  Or are there additional electrical components contributing to a higher component price? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/em&gt; I have no coffee maker designing or manufacturing experience.  This answer is based on internet research and professional experience.  This answer addresses some of the product design challenges and less of the real engineering challenges, but a lead into the engineering challenges. Based on the question and comment I believe OP is interested in designing a coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a business standpoint most organizations strive to service segments of the market that organizations believe they have a competitive advantage. These organizations also try to offer products to meet opening (OPP), mid (MPP) and High (HPP) price points. Also branding place a significant part in product pricing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assumption: US dollar = Euro (Approximately, 1 Euro = 1.09 US$) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee Maker Product Landscape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Based on the above I did some research on &lt;a href="http://www.foodservicewarehouse.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;food services warehouse&lt;/a&gt; and selected Grindmaster for this analysis. Base on list price following are the price point classification (Dollars $)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OPP: 1000 - 2600&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MPP: 3500 - 4700&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HPP: 6000 - 10,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a table for OPP, MPP, and HPP price segmentation (April 6th, 2015)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zRxCv.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zRxCvm.jpg" alt="Price segmentation"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets assume the following as customer segments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OPP: Small office break room coffee machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MPP: Large office cafeteria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HPP: High traffic coffee shop, Panera, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Flow rate was chosen to keep the analysis simple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OPP:  4 - 15 gl/hr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MPP: 15 - 32 gl/hr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HPP:  32 - 50 gl/hr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engineering Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Consider the Motor (Rotor, Stator, Casting) or the heating element from the BOM. Each of the price points (PP) most like need a different type of component. The component price to meet the above flow rate specification can be significantly different. Also the product volume is each PP is different thus for HPP or even MPP product it is highly unlikely to obtain volume base pricing that OPP might enjoy. Thus explains the cost of components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImt.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImtm.jpg" alt="Example BOM for  coffee Maker"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Testing, Validation and Manufacturing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The cost of testing, validation and manufacturing will be much higher for MPP and HPP product because the consumer demands for higher quality product compared to OPP products.  Thus the non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost per machine will much higher for MPP and HPP product than the OPP products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Serviceability and Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An OPP price point product needs very little from a serviceability and after sale support compared to MPP or HPP product. An OPP customer is most likely replace a defective coffee maker with a new coffee make where is MPP or HPP customer will consider maintenance. Also consider a customer like Starbuck or Panera, they demand for high quality, and zero downtime. Therefore the components used in MPP or HPP coffee makers of significantly higher quality than the OPP coffee makers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product Pricing VS BOM price -&gt; General rule of thumb is BOM cost is 1/5 the Product Price. I believe this is a good starting point to figure what take to compete in the intended the coffee maker market. It appears that the coffee maker market is a red ocean. Therefore it important identify the point of differentiation. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>When accounting for bloom, why is the common instruction to stir with very little water?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There is already a question on &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/337/what-is-coffee-bloom"&gt;What is coffee bloom&lt;/a&gt; here, and one about &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/21482/when-making-french-press-coffee-what-is-the-purpose-of-blooming-the-grounds"&gt;why "blooming" the grounds is necessary&lt;/a&gt; over on seasoned advice. A currently unanswered question here is &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1683/does-the-bloom-matter-in-french-press"&gt;is blooming actually necessary in French Press&lt;/a&gt;, which an answer to that may help answer this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fair amount of instructions I've seen that refer to this step instruct you to stir after adding just enough water to get all the grounds wet. However, there are accounts of people getting the same effect just stirring after all the water is added (in non-drip styles of coffee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a significant difference between blooming with some water and blooming with all? I like being able to rinse off the stirrer with the rest of the water, but I'm curious nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Blooming is the outgassing of CO2 (carbon dioxide) from the ground coffee in response to hot water being added.  The more recently the coffee has been roasted, the more bloom you can expect.  It doesn't make a huge difference ultimately if this is done quickly or slowly when you brew your coffee.  What I have noticed myself is that it's sometimes diffcult to predict how much foam is going to be produced when the water is poured over the grounds.  More than once I have misjudged the amount of bloom and made a foamy brown mess on my countertop.  If you just add enough water to wet the grounds first, you accomplish two things.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, all the coffee is wetted at nearly the same time which better controls how the flavors are extracted, since different flavor profiles extract at different rates.  Sometimes adding all the water at once creates lumps of dry coffee mixed in with the bloom and wetted coffee and it takes a bit of stirring to get all that wetted.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, adding a small amount of water controls how quickly the bloom will occur. You'll get most of the bloom done well within the pot and you'll avoid the huge foam ball at the top of your brew that might overflow the pot (or AeroPress in my case), but really this is more of a technique thing than a chemistry thing.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it possible to regrind beans?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to regrind beans?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have about half a bag of very nice coffee in a semi-coarse grind, and I want to use a brew method (Melitta cone) that's more appropriate for a medium-coarse grind.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty good way to ruin a burr grinder. Worst case scenario, your burrs jam up so much that they can't spin and burn out your motor. A blade could help, but I'd argue that the inconsistent grind you'd get wouldn't be much of an improvement in cup quality anyway. Realistically you'd end up with some of your grinds unchanged, some at the size you want and some ground to dust. The different sized particles would extract unevenly and the dust is likely to clog the filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, you're not going to break a blade grinder by regrinding, so give it a shot and see how you like the results. At most you're out 20-50g of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Adding creamer after boiling water vs before</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Hello all I started making instant coffee for the last few months. Due to a combination of laziness and lack of a proper coffee maker. I find that I actually enjoy instant a lot. Normally the process is 2 teaspoons of coffee, add boiling water and then creamer. My question is does the taste amplify if I add creamer before adding the boiling water thus transforming the coffee molecules in a different order? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't say it would amplify it, and you may very well not be able to tell much of a difference. Unless the milk or cream is hot, your coffee won't brew very well (or at least not as fast) on just the milk alone. So by the time you add your hot water, it still shouldn't have dissolved the instant coffee enough to make much of a difference.
If you wanted to experiment, I would try adding some hot cream or milk to the instant coffee first and stirring it up a bit. Still probably wouldn't make much of a difference other than it tasting more like a latte. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there a "caffeine metabolism curve", understood by general public?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've long been interested in how long caffeine stays in my body and what are the effects at different concentrations and times. For example, a popular site &lt;a href="https://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_effects.shtml" rel="noreferrer"&gt;erowid has metabolism curves for most illegal drugs&lt;/a&gt;, along with side effects. However, it's caffeine entry is mostly anecdotal experiences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of what cannabis metabolic curve looks like: &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MluJ6.gif" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a similar metabolic curve with onset, total duration, peak, plateau for caffeine?&lt;/strong&gt; Does the kind of coffee consumed affect the curve?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Most medications approved by the FDA and used in a medical setting have such statistics.  Caffeine is no exception.  Most drug databases have listed pharmacokinetics for caffeine.  Onset is listed as 15 to 45 minutes with peak concentrations as 30 minutes in adults.  Half life for caffeine varies based on a number of factors.  For adults it is listed as 4 to 5 hours, however, studies suggest it is generally less for smokers.  It is much much longer for infants (52 to 96 hours) but generally by nine months of age, those numbers have dropped to similar levels seen in adults.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Methods to get a better taste out of iced coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been experimenting with iced coffee lately as summer has started and I haven't really had any good results. The coffee always tastes...different then what I believe it should taste like. What factors could attribute to having good iced coffee? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brew it by using a standard coffee brewer (drip, i believe?) and then well, I ice it. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Iced coffee, specifically drip brewed coffee poured over ice has a few things to consider with respect to taste. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has the acidity of regular coffee, often making it harsh(er) to drink, cold brewing can reduce this acidity by 70% but also potentially leave some of the flavor a behind in the coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will be diluted since the ice will melt leaving you with a weaker tasting drink. Often this is compensated for by doubling the strength of the hot brew and letting the ice dilute to normal strength&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supposedly (although I've never tried it), the Japanese iced coffee method is a middle ground between iced and cold brewed coffees. In this method, hot coffee is brewed directly over ice instantly cooling it locking in the full flavor of hot coffee, but oxidizing much less. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often it comes down to taste what in particular might work to make your iced coffee better. A different bean type or roast level, maybe on that is slightly less acidic or more bold may give you the flavor you are looking for. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Optimizing the office pot</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I usually get to work about an hour before most of the other people in the office do and I've got the 2-3 carafe's all to myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're brewing a 1.9 liter pot each time, so I'm not sure how much coffee that is. It's about 8 cups, so about 8-10 TBSP's is right on the money? Still it should cover the bottom of the coffee filter a ways up right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've got a bunn &lt;a href="http://www.cw-usa.com/equipment-commercial-airpotsystems-bunn-brewers-cwtf15aps.html"&gt;CWTF15-APS&lt;/a&gt; coffee maker with an automatic hookup to some not terrible tasting water.  Are there any subtle ways I can alter the situation to make a truly tasty pot of coffee out of pre-packaged ground coffee without spending any money?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Three quick and easy hacks you can do without throwing capitol at the issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shoot a dud pot first thing in the morning.  By brewing a coffeeless pot and throwing away the water, you will empty the the Bunn's hot bladder.  Think of it as a morning tinkle for the CWTF15-APS to git rid of the rank overnight water fouling your morning joe. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an extra filter. Substandard inputs are signiflatulanceficantly improved by an additional filter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrape the the cheeto and donut leavin's off of the lip of your coffee cup once in a while.  The "seasoned" coffee cup is a myth as proven in a blind taste test where we forced coworkers to drink coffee from a randomly selected sampling of well seasoned and clean coffee mugs.  There was a little bit of a flatulence effect with seasoned mugs in that a subset of coworkers "liked their own brand" in testing, but the overwhelming data suggest that dirty mugs are just gross. &lt;/li&gt;

  <title>How long can I keep my carafe on the warmer?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've heard that the heater plate of my coffee maker will give my coffee a "burnt" aftertaste. But about how long do I have after brewing? Is the effect more or less immediate, or will the effect not be noticeable for a few hours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using a &lt;a href="https://www.cuisinart.com/products/coffee_makers/dcc-2650.html"&gt;Cuisinart DCC-2650&lt;/a&gt; with an adjustable warmer.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It would depend on a number or factors including temperature of the warmer and humidity in the room.  However, personally, I can begin to taste a difference after as little as 45 minutes on the warmer.  I tend to drink two cups of coffee pretty quickly to avoid this.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee is a product always best fresh, but how long before your palate can detect that it isn't fresh any longer is a matter that varies by individual.  My wife will drink coffee from a pot that has been sitting for four hours plus; after about an hour and a half I'll throw the pot away and make another.  Your own mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The iced method isn’t complicated. Basically, you prepare brewed coffee as you normally would, only you use half hot water, half ice you put in the bottom of the vessel. The hot, fresh coffee drips directly onto ice so that it’s cool and ready to drink right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've now tried it a few times using my small chemex and a ratio of 2:1 (water to ice) rather than 50:50. I'm trying the pour over much more slowly than I normally would to maximise the extraction while using less water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't really fault the taste, the flavour is still great, the finish is less acidic but obviously more watery. So while this method is indeed quick and uncomplicated I'm curious about 2 things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What else can I do to compensate for the extraction difference? I would really prefer it to be less watery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Am I potentially going to crack the pot with the combination of hot and cold? I can't find any info on temperature variances on the Chemex site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited to add information...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a hot-brew I normally use  using 300ml hot water for 21g of grind. Here I'm using 200ml hot water in the pour over, to compensate for the 100g of ice that melts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm taking 6-7 minutes with the pour. Normally I would take 3 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm making my grind slightly finer in order to extend time it takes the water to drip through. I would consider it to be medium-fine. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;What you're talking about is the "Japanese iced coffee" method, which is hot-water brew directly over ice. In contrast, cold-brew is using cold water in contact with the grounds. See techniques at other questions tagged as &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/cold-brew" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;cold-brew&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;cold-brew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://counterculturecoffee.com/learn/iced-coffee" rel="nofollow"&gt;This article from Counter Culture&lt;/a&gt;, also referenced in the article you linked, suggest Japanese iced as an &lt;em&gt;alternative&lt;/em&gt; to cold brew. The articles suggest that directly brewing hot coffee over ice retains more of the volatile flavour compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have had true cold-brew before, most methods use &lt;em&gt;several times&lt;/em&gt; as much coffee grounds to brew as with other methods (some then dilute this with, e.g., water or milk). For example, normalized to a 200mL "cup" (~6.5 fl.oz.) of brewed coffee: Blue Bottle suggests about 3x more coffee for &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/cold-brew" rel="nofollow"&gt;cold brew&lt;/a&gt; (45g per 200mL) than for &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip" rel="nofollow"&gt;drip&lt;/a&gt; (14g per 200mL). If you're coming from that strength, it's no wonder you're finding it watery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To your first question: If you want a stronger brew, why not &lt;strong&gt;simply use more coffee grounds&lt;/strong&gt;? Your amount (21g grounds to 300g water+ice is about 14g/200mL cup) is already at the higher end of the spectrum for drip coffee; the industry standard is closer to 7g per cup/dose. But if you want it stronger, use more beans!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your other question: &lt;strong&gt;this temperature change shouldn't be an issue.&lt;/strong&gt; You said you're using a Chemex (e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/three-cup-classic-series-coffeemaker.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;classic 3-cup&lt;/a&gt;) -- it is made from Pyrex brand &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borosilicate_glass" rel="nofollow"&gt;borosilicate glass&lt;/a&gt;, which has very good thermal shock properties. Even a lesser glass (e.g., non-tempered &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda-lime_glass" rel="nofollow"&gt;soda-lime glass&lt;/a&gt;) shouldn't be a problem at these temperatures (slowly dripping boiling water onto ice). (However, for example, ice into glass at oven temperatures could &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; be a problem).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How does freezing affect vacuum packed coffee beans?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently vacuum packed 1 kg of coffee beans that were about to expire into 100 g portions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to know how they will be affected by the freezing and how long they will last in the freezer.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Freezing will not affect the coffee beans chemically. Thawing may affect them though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you thaw the beans, small amounts of water (that were frozen as small amounts of air humidity) will melt and it may collect together and cause some very small extractions in the bean. This is probably quite minimal due to the fact that you have vacuum packed the beans though. This is generally undesirable but it is up to you whether or not you want to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do indeed freeze them, make sure that you let them thaw completely before opening the package. Do not open the package until they are back to room temperature. This is so that the humidity can stabilize inside. If you open the package earlier, moisture from the air may condense onto the beans, causing a small amount of extraction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of how long they will last in the freezer? I am unsure of this as I have never frozen my beans as it is not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Espresso - Dose affecting extraction time disproportionately</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Pasquini Livia 90 and a Baratza Vario Ceramic grinder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm finding that the only way to tame my extraction speed is by over dosing the basket. Specifically, by loading the basket so heavily that it pushes up against the shower screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I use a double shot basket, I have to load 21+ grams to get the extraction down to a brew ratio of 2:3. Basically, I have to get it to the point where I'm struggling to insert the portafilter, otherwise the extraction speed is just incredibly fast. At the recommended starting point for the Vario grinder for espresso, (2Q), it takes about 7 seconds for an extraction using 16 grams of coffee in a double basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I stick to the recommended doses, and give the coffee some headroom from the shower screen, I end up having to use the finest possible setting (1A - 1E) on my grinder to 'slow the flow'. This results in extremely overextracted tasting coffee, which makes sense because the grind is like powdered sugar at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I missing here?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I would not exceed 20 grams on a twenty gram basket. Weird things start to happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would make your grind finer - and simply stop your shot quicker. If it tastes overextracted, then stop your shot even quicker the next time. Adjust accordingly until you get the sweetest shot you possibly can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your general espresso recipe for a well roasted coffee should be somewhere around:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20 grams of coffee in
extracted for 26 seconds
A yield of around 30 grams of espresso&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps and good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there any way to overcome cycling with a moka on an induction stove?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In my eternal quest to make a decent cup of coffee at my parents' house, with an induction stove and moka, I recently discovered an interesting problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having found a good heat setting for the hob (that doesn't superheat the water instantly and boil it dry in ~20 seconds), I found that the hob attempts to maintain thermostatis by cycling the power on and off. This may work fine for a large pot of boiling water, but for the moka pot this means I get a few seconds of extraction, followed by a few seconds of water &lt;em&gt;being sucked back down the wrong way&lt;/em&gt; as the pressure decreases, then forwards, then back, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any way of overcoming this? Is it even likely to cause a problem with the extraction?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As far as my experience with Moka pots, I don't have them on the stove for long. Something that I got in that habit of doing when using moka pots is to boil the water before I put it in the Moka pot, then introducing it to heat, then removing shortly after it starts to percolate. Stumptown illustrates a similar method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the induction stove cycling to maintain a steady temp, if you set the temperature over boiling(212F, but may differ by altitude) it likely won't cycle. This is because water will not exceed boiling point, under most circumstances, in a liquid state. For instance water is often used to prevent things from burning, because it keeps the temperature below the boiling temperature until all the water is evaporated. So if you set the induction stove to above the water's boiling point it will likely not exceed that temperature. It might take a bit to find a sweet spot. Though I'm not sure, I have never used an induction stove with a moka pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I had not considered is the boiling point increases with pressure. So it might be worth turning the heat up quite a bit beyond 212F/100C. Its pretty difficult to burn water. Then again if you're using an induction stove to avoid heat pollution on the moka pot, then you can just use a traditional stove with the method I described and avoid the need to use an induction stove.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to (re-)calibrate an espresso machine and grinder setup?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When you're starting your shift at your coffee shop and take over the bar from another barista, the machine and grinder can be in varying states of cleanliness and calibration. How do you quickly and correctly get back to pulling good shots from clean equipment?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This answer addresses a &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; semi-automatic espresso machine with a separate grinder. Specifically the LaMarzocco and Astoria grinder, but the ideas should generalize to other machines of the same class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cleaning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, wipe down everything and get all pitchers and spoons clean. Blast out all the milk and &amp;quot;wetness&amp;quot; from the steam wands. Inspect and clean all portafilters* (get one clean, and then use it while you clean the others), and if necessary backflush the groups with water (with &amp;quot;bumping&amp;quot; so you blast water around the seals to get any buildup there clean).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*especially &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt; the basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Calibrating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract procedure here is described using the Hackers' terms &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frob" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Frob, Twiddle, and Tweak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6v8sh.png" alt="frob quote from Hackers' Dictionary" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/F/frob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/F/frob.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fully calibrate the setup, we'll need to make three passes over all the controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frob. In the &lt;em&gt;frob&lt;/em&gt; pass, we make just &amp;quot;coarse&amp;quot; adjustments to get everything roughly correct. (reinterpreting the hacker usage. This isn't &lt;em&gt;aimless&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twiddle. In the &lt;em&gt;twiddle&lt;/em&gt; pass, we adjust each parameter up and down a little, in a more &amp;quot;scientific&amp;quot; manner: while adjusting any one parameter, the rest are left alone so they behave as &amp;quot;controls&amp;quot; for the quick little &amp;quot;experiments&amp;quot; to check each change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweak. In the &lt;em&gt;tweak&lt;/em&gt; pass, everything should be mostly correct by now. Just apply any finishing touches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controls we have available are the &lt;strong&gt;grind&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;dose&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;water quantity&lt;/strong&gt;. Following the David Schomer method, I strongly advise that the tamping pressure should be &lt;em&gt;constant&lt;/em&gt;. Always tamp the same way: from the elbow, so you don't stress your wrists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the David Schomer method, the dose is controlled by counting &amp;quot;clicks&amp;quot; of the doser. You keep the doser compartment as empty as possible, grinding only what you need so everything stays fresh, locked in the bean). Count how many clicks gets you to &amp;quot;full&amp;quot;, maybe a little heaping. This number is your &lt;em&gt;base&lt;/em&gt; dose. Keep it constant for now. And this constitutes the &amp;quot;frob&amp;quot; of the dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the group in programming mode and Pull a shot, setting the water level to yield 2 oz. This is the &amp;quot;frob&amp;quot; of the water quantity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the extraction time was off, adjust the grind. This the &amp;quot;frob&amp;quot; of the grind, so you can make bigger movements if you need to (exercise your judgement), but remember only adjust finer while grinding, so you don't lock the burrs on a tough bean. Pull a few shots until the time is (roughly) correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we've done our &amp;quot;frob&amp;quot; pass. Now &amp;quot;twiddle.&amp;quot; Adjusting the grind to control the extraction time probably threw off the water quantity a little bit. So do a &amp;quot;twiddle&amp;quot; of the water quantity by entering programming mode and pulling a shot. Actually, you shouldn't need to &amp;quot;twiddle&amp;quot; per se: there's no *up and down&amp;quot; here, but I think the terms still represent a useful mnemonic for the general procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then do a &amp;quot;twiddle&amp;quot; of the grind. You want the grind to be as coarse as possible within its &amp;quot;range&amp;quot;, if you know what I mean. All the grounds in the doser are quickly going stale. A coarser grind yields little pieces of coffee bean that are slightly larger, with a lower surface/volume ratio. Lower surface area means less interaction with the air, and the grounds resist going stale a little better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should be no need to &amp;quot;twiddle&amp;quot; the dose at this point. We're adjusting the other controls so the dose remains at comfortable spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, one final pass to &amp;quot;tweak&amp;quot;. Pull a shot, and examine its quality. Particularly look for the tell-tale white &amp;quot;overextraction stain&amp;quot; where the last drips struck the crema. You want to tweak the water quantity to stop &lt;em&gt;just before&lt;/em&gt; the color changes. This tweak gives you &amp;quot;ristretto-quality&amp;quot; shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adjusting on-the-fly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that we did not mess with the dose much in the above steps. But the other parameters were setup so the dose is &amp;quot;comfortable&amp;quot;. This lets us make small adjustments to the dose in order to &amp;quot;ride the wave&amp;quot; of the machine and keep all the shots in the time range. Remember not to brew shots while the boiler is cycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same three adjustments, &lt;strong&gt;frob&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt;, apply also to dynamic adjustments. &lt;strong&gt;Frob&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;coarsest&lt;/em&gt; control is the water quantity, which should no longer need adjusting at this point. &lt;strong&gt;Twiddle&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;medium-grain&lt;/em&gt; control is the grind setting. Unless a freak thundershower rolls-in and totally changes the pressure and humidity of the atmosphere, you should only need to make small adjustments and only to recalibrate the dose to a comfortable level. &lt;strong&gt;Tweak&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;finest&lt;/em&gt; control is the dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a shot pulls 1-second too long, &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt; your dose ever-so-slightly shorter. Either count 1-fewer click, or count your clicks just a hair faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a shot pulls 1-second too short, &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt; your dose ever-so-slightly longer. Either count 1 more click, or count your clicks just a hair slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the dose gets too low (by visual inspection: exercise your judgement), &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt; the grind a little coarser so you can achieve the same &lt;em&gt;density&lt;/em&gt; with more &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the dose gets too high (exercise judgement), &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt; the grind a little finer so you can achieve the &lt;em&gt;density&lt;/em&gt; with less &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;. (Volume is constant.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I actually haven't worked on this machine in almost 10 years. So this is all based on my memory of that one amazing day when I pulled 20sec (+/-1) shots for eight solid hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a different day, I recalibrated after a thunderstorm started by pulling the grinder 8 clicks (!) coarser. And got it back to 20sec after 2 or 3 pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's how I know. But I learned this all from David Schomer's book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appendix: The &amp;quot;David Schomer&amp;quot; method or &amp;quot;ritual&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I remember from the amazing book, &lt;em&gt;Espresso Coffee: Professional techniques&lt;/em&gt; by David Schomer. And hey Matt, I want my copy back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A. &lt;strong&gt;Preheat and Clean.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pull an ounce or so of water &lt;em&gt;through the old spent puck&lt;/em&gt; to heat the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yank the portafilter and knock the old puck into the compost bin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wipe the basket and run a splash of water through the group without the portafilter to rinse the upper screen. &lt;em&gt;(You can catch this water with the portafilter before wiping to rinse more of the grounds so your clean towel stays clean longer.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;B. &lt;strong&gt;Grind and Dose.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn on grinder to start to fill the doser (which should be as empty as practical).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately start pulling clicks of the doser until the basket is full, or &lt;em&gt;a little&lt;/em&gt; heaping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn off grinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;C. &lt;strong&gt;Distribute and Tamp.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With clean hands, distribute the grounds evenly with a finger (I use my ring finger, but whatever works).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tamp lightly to shape the puck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tap the edge with the handle end of your nice aluminum tamper that you bought yourself and brought to work to help. This gets the little bit of coffee around the edge that the tamper missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tamp firmly, from the elbow. About 30 pounds of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinsert the portafiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;D. &lt;strong&gt;Brew.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the button to start brewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately discard the hot water from the shot glasses which is still there from step A.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the pour and stop it early if you need to, to catch the &lt;em&gt;sweet spot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, I apologize for my excessive use of emphatic &amp;quot;quotation marks&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is white coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;white coffee&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does "white coffee" refer to the roast level of the beans, or additives to the beverage, or is it some other type of coffee bean, or a different beverage completely?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As suggested by several previous comments, there's several things that could be called "white coffee." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_coffee" rel="noreferrer"&gt;white coffee&lt;/a&gt; article on Wikipedia, and other sources (e.g., &lt;a href="http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/53" rel="noreferrer"&gt;coffeefaq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nescafe.com/white_coffee_en_com.axcms" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Nescafé&lt;/a&gt;); others listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simply referring to coffee with whitener (e.g., milk, creamer, etc.);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Lebanese drink &lt;em&gt;ahweh bayda&lt;/em&gt;, made from water, orange blossom water, and (perhaps) sugar (more &lt;a href="http://www.tasteofbeirut.com/white-coffee-ahweh-bayda/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipoh_white_coffee" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Ipoh white coffee&lt;/a&gt;; of Malaysian origin, this refers to beans that are lightly roasted with margarine (and perhaps sugar and wheat), brewed and served with sweetened condensed milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee beans that are roasted to the "yellow" roast level, then ground and prepared as espresso; the result is a pale yellow brew with a nutty flavour and assertive acidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A beverage originating in Yemen, probably from the literal translation &lt;em&gt;qahwa bayda&lt;/em&gt;. I've never had this, and can't find consistent information on it, but things that I have seen suggest that it's any number of different preparations, including the following: coffee made from lightly roasted beans plus spices; or a spiced coffee cherry tea (e.g., &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qishr" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;qishr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;); or even something non-coffee similar to the Lebanese variety above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A longer shot (so to speak...) is that it could indicate a &lt;a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/trends/article/flat-white-coffee" rel="noreferrer"&gt;flat white&lt;/a&gt;, which is a coffee drink similar to a cappuccino or latte but with higher proportion of milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is also a company called &lt;a href="http://www.whitecoffee.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;White Coffee Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, but perhpas not what you're looking for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this is a reasonable (albeit, perhaps not acutely helpful) summary.&lt;/p&gt;

They are likely available in your local grocer, you just need to check the label and make sure refrigeration isn't required.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are paranoid about potential bacterial growth or contamination (like me) you may check into bulk buying the single serving creamers that they use at restaurants.  They require no refrigeration either and are sealed until use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to keep "real cream" cold for 8 to 10 hours, you may want to look into some sort of freezable lunch bag or small ice chest that will stay cold and takes up less space than a mini-fridge.  This would require substantially more effort, but may be worth it if you are particular about your cream.  Also from the comments below, you may look into a double wall vacuum thermos.  They are increasingly popular and come in a wide variety of qualities and prices, so do your research before buying.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>In home roasting, does the time spent roasting matter, or only the final temperature?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Fresh Roast SR500 home roaster and have had some success roasting mostly drinkable coffee.  My first attempts, following the instructions enclosed with the roaster turned out horribly, tasting both charred and grassy at the same time.  Yeechh.  After doing some online reading, I've greatly lengthened the roasting process with mostly good results.  I'm currently roasting batches of 90g of raw beans for between 12-17 minutes.  My thinking is that this is giving the beans time for the proper reactions to take place inside the beans without charring the outside.  But I've read that some commercial roasters might take 20 minutes or more to roast a batch.  Of course they are roasting much larger quantities than I am but it occurred to me that perhaps this longer roasting time is intentional and has some beneficial effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm mostly aiming for a City or City+ roast level and want to know if lengthening the roast time beyond what I'm currently doing is a good idea?  I would still stop the roast soon after First Crack, but I suppose I could stretch out the time to get there if that might produce a better product.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It does matter for a couple of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing out the roast generally produces more even results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slower roasts mean that you have a better chance of stopping the roast at the target level and not over or under roasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can search the online forums for some of the home roasting sites, but many people run their roasters at a higher setting, then turn down the heat once the roasting process is rolling.  Some of the more expensive machines even have "roast profiles" preprogrammed to modulate the temperature up and down for desired results.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I think there is a point of diminishing returns between the time dinkering with the roaster and the difference in the taste.  Most of my roasting lands in the 15 to 16 minute range and comes out even enough that I feel good about it.  I recommend drawing the time out just enough that the results are even enough for you and you are comfortably hitting your target roast level the vast majority of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Whats special about the Hario V60 filterpapers?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm using the Hario V60 for quite some time and I always used the V60 filterpapers which are stated to be the best for my ceramic dripper. I never thought about it, until a friend of mine ask me whats special about them and why I don't use normal papers which will quite fit into them too and are much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I couldn't answer it for sure. I just thought about it, that I read something about a different paper structure but as I said. I'm not sure with this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any real difference between the V60 paper and normal filters or is it just the fact that they will fit better into my ceramic dripper?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short version:&lt;/strong&gt; The Hario brand filters are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;thinner than other paper filters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and seem to have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;more texture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; than other types of filters. I assume this has some, but perhaps slight, impact on the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;rate at which water passes through the filter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;what "stuff" passes through the filter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which impacts the resulting brew and its taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longer version:&lt;/strong&gt; The rest of this response is basically a comparison of the Hario filters to other types of filters. This isn't particularly authoritative nor scientific. I don't immediately find any good online resources on this; one video that I don't care to link or watch, and another article from &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/11/best-ceramic-coffee-dripper-pourover-hario-bonmac-bee-house-kalita-reviews.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Serious Eats on dripper styles&lt;/a&gt; but it doesn't compare the filters themselves as such. So, I'm going rogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The different cone (and filter) manufacturers each have their own shape, presumably to ensure product lock-in for consumables (in this case, primarily filters). Here are the three primary ones that I'm aware of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NqO7d.jpg" alt="brown paper filters"&gt;
Clockwise from upper left: off-brand Melitta-style #2, Hario brand V60 02, Chemex brand pre-folded bonded. All are "natural" brown (unbleached, etc.) varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My basic summary, having looked at these three examples from my own stockpile (certainly, this is a small sample) in order from thickest to thinnest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Chemex filter is very thick; almost more like like a thin pressed cotton cloth or fabric. Almost completely opaque. &lt;a href="http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/filters.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Chemex filter page&lt;/a&gt; states that they are "20-30% heavier" than other filters and removes finer sediment and "undesirable oils and fats".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Melitta-style is in the middle, and is similar in nature to most other Melitta-style and basket-style filter paper. Thick enough to be mostly opaque, but noticeably thinner than Chemex. The &lt;a href="http://www.melitta.com/en/2-Cone-Filter-Paper-Natural-Brown-40-Count-1428,64752.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Melitta brand filters&lt;/a&gt; have claimed "flavor enhancing perforations."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hario brand is the thinnest by a fair margin. It's almost translucent through most of the filter, with a somewhat leaf-vein-like pattern to it, presumably from paper fibre and production method. This brown ("natural") style seems to be called "Misarashi" for reasons I don't understand. There's little information on the Hario (&lt;a href="http://www.hario.co.uk/coffee/v60-filter-papers.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="http://www.hario.jp/product/list.php?middelclass=2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;.jp&lt;/a&gt;) pages about the nature of the filters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I don't notice a significant difference in coffee draining rate (throughput), but I suspect there is. I (personally) think there's a slight difference in taste and output of the brew, but perhaps I'm fooling myself into legitimizing more coffee gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1969/262"&gt;this other question about Hario V60 filters&lt;/a&gt; off-brand filters do not seem common (in our regions).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What molds grow in brewed coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;This question is not about molds that affect coffee plants. I am asking about molds that grow in coffee that has been sitting for a few days or more. I did not find any scientific articles on point so I have begun to try to answer the question by observing; but I may have missed an article and someone else may know the answer already. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roasting probably kills any mold in coffee beans and if molds grow in a cup of brewed coffee they come from the surrounding air. After leaving many partially-filled cups in various spaces and looking at molds that grew in them, &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Penicillium&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Aureobasidium&lt;/em&gt; are the only molds I have seen under the microscope so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone has seen an authoritative article about this it would interest me. Thanks. (This is not a health issue, IMO. I'm just curious.)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Though I don't have any articles on the matter, I can certainly say I've found cups of coffee that I had forgotten that are only maybe a week old with mold growing in them. I'd assume it gets contaminated so quickly, because of its sugar content. It might just be a coincidence, but it seems to happen more readily with coffee that I brew over ice. I press my areopress directly over ice, I've heard this reduces the acidity. Which would make sense, as acidity usually wards off mold. I leave all of my coffee black and unsweetened, so it is not dairy or added sugars that are causing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps try variating your brewing process. I'd be especially keen on the pH. Maybe there are some spores which will not grow in environments below a certain pH.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Using an areo press with Maxwell house?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I use an AeroPress to brew Maxwell House?&lt;/strong&gt; It seems like most people around here drink fancy coffee but they don't sell it where I'm from. I asked the lady at the grocery store if she had Sumatran beans and she gave me a funny look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I searched, but I don't see anyone who has tried it. Think it will work?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, of course!&lt;/strong&gt; As "fancy" coffee company &lt;a href="https://counterculturecoffee.com/learn/any-coffee-any-brew" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Counter Culture says: &lt;em&gt;Any Coffee, Any Brew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, even things that &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; actually coffee (barley, tea, herbs, etc.) could be brewed like coffee in an AeroPress or other coffee-brewing equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if fancy coffee is not your preference (or not practical, or not available, or whatever), try something different. And why not a cultural staple like Maxwell House (or Folgers or Nescafé or Eight O'Clock or Café du Monde or ...)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, a &lt;strong&gt;mass-market coffee like this might &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; from AeroPress treatment.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, some of these blends include a significant portion of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robusta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; beans, which is a traditional component of many blends (including some Italian espresso blends). Robusta might have some advantages in an AeroPress. &lt;a href="http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/barista/10-14-2006" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Robusta produces &lt;strong&gt;more crema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in espresso, and might be a way to get &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress"&gt;more crema from AeroPress&lt;/a&gt;. Robusta also has slightly &lt;strong&gt;more caffeine&lt;/strong&gt; than &lt;em&gt;Arabica&lt;/em&gt;, so that's something else you might be looking for. Since AeroPress (generally) infuses for less time than drip, &lt;strong&gt;you might reduce a bit of the bitterness&lt;/strong&gt; sometimes present in mass-market coffees (regardless of bean makeup).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There might be a few problems, though.&lt;/strong&gt; First, the default grind of pre-ground coffee like &lt;strong&gt;Maxwell House is rather course&lt;/strong&gt; for an AeroPress. You could try to re-grind the coffee to be a bit finer, but it's generally not recommended because it can clog grinders (see more on this from &lt;a href="http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/can-ground-coffee-be-re-ground-t29153.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Home-Barista&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.bunn.com/dr-brew-blog/re-grinding-coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Bunn&lt;/a&gt;). Second, if there are other "stuff" in the coffee (e.g., "Folgers Crystals" or other additives) this might not behave the same way in the AeroPress as it might for drip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But give it a try! In the best case, you can enjoy a mass-market coffee even more than you'd expect. In the worst case, you're out a few quid, but you have a fun story and a hefty caffeine buzz.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>To what extent have C. arabica beans been replaced by rust-resistant cultivars?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There have been articles in the news about coffee rust affecting coffee crops in many places. After reading this &lt;a href="http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/fungi/Basidiomycetes/Pages/CoffeeRust.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; it dawned on me that not only is &lt;em&gt;C.liberica&lt;/em&gt; (resistant to rust) being exported in large quantities from some places (Phillipines, for example), Colombian researchers have developed resistant hybrids that may well be replacing &lt;em&gt;C. arabica&lt;/em&gt;--to some extent-- in South America as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I go to my local coffee place and get a (relatively) expensive espresso my assumption is that the beans are &lt;em&gt;arabica&lt;/em&gt; unless otherwise indicated. If you look at a futures contract for coffee, there is a big premium for coffee from certain countries, in part because it is assumed to be &lt;em&gt;arabica.&lt;/em&gt; Is this still true and, if not, what percentage of coffee labeled &lt;em&gt;arabica&lt;/em&gt; is actually &lt;em&gt;arabica&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My link is now broken and in response to the comments I am going to add links on efforts to (partly) replace Arabica with resistant species or hybrids. Here is one: &lt;a href="http://baristamagazine.com/blog/coffee-leaf-rust-problems-with-rust-resistant-varieties/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Barista Magazine, resistant hybrids of Arabia-Robusta.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Even with the impact of below average crop yields from Coffee Rust, Arabica beans still make up at least 75% of the world's coffee crop. Although they are affected by the rust, Arabica plantations will tend to recover within a few years and go back to business as usual. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLR resistant varieties aren't &lt;a href="http://baristamagazine.com/blog/coffee-leaf-rust-problems-with-rust-resistant-varieties/" rel="nofollow"&gt;without problems.&lt;/a&gt; They are still vulnerable to other desease that can have an impact on crops. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't believe there to be such a limit in Europe though, so you should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It costs ¥ 3,369 which comes down to roughly $27. And no account is required to order. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can I get rid of this wood fiber taste?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The first thing I taste when I make coffee is a wood fiber taste. By the second sip, its gone and the coffee tastes tolerable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I buy a Costa Rican Arabica roast from BJ's. I buy several pounds and stick it in the freezer. I grind before brewing. Have just bought a Breville Smart Grinder Pro and a Behmor Brazen Plus drip coffee maker (gold tone paperless filter). My grind size on the Breville is 48, the high end of medium according to their guide. However, I might be inclined to call it fine as pictures I've seen on the web lead me to this conclusion. Also, grinds tend to float in the air as I grind. As to the Brazen, I brew at 204 degrees with a 1.5 minute soak cycle. I use eight cups (setting) of grinds to make six cups of coffee. I intend to experiment but I'd like to hear some expert advice also. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the question is, can I avoid that wood fiber flavor or am I stuck with it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I would suggest buying any other kind of non-flavored coffee (or borrowing some) and using your same parameters to make a pot.  That should determine whether your machine/process is imparting that taste to the beans or if it's just the coffee itself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lightly roasted coffee often has tastes described as woody, grassy, or sometimes tea like.  This can vary from &lt;em&gt;very noticeable&lt;/em&gt; at light roast levels to &lt;em&gt;not at all noticeable&lt;/em&gt; at moderate levels.  Even if you have purchased those same beans before and were not expecting the taste, it's possible you purchased a bag less roasted than previous bags you have bought. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What factors determine coffee bean size?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I bought a bag of Guatemala/Colombia/Ethiopia blend after having single origin Peru beans (all Arabica), and was struck by the difference in bean size: Peruvian beans were almost twice larger than the beans in the blend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I'm wondering whether the difference is conditioned by some environmental factors, or regional differences of the coffee plant, or the timing of harvesting. Of course, it can also be that any coffee plant anywhere produces beans of (significantly) different size, and then they are sorted into size-consistent batches (as per &lt;a href="http://www.thecoffeeguide.org/coffee-guide/coffee-quality/bean-size/"&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt;, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The single biggest factor in the size of a coffee bean is the botanical variety of the plant. There is no amount of nutrition or growing conditions that can overcome the effect of genetics.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this picture from our garden at Coffea Diversa you can see two examples at the extreme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one hand you have mokka, this variety has the smallest bean of all
coffee varieties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand you have Maragogype, this variety has the largest
bean of all coffee varieties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no amount of fertilizer that you can give to a mokka grain to make it even come close to the size of a ripe Maragogype bean (and viceversa). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference in sizes between your blend and peruvian coffees are probably due to the botanical varieties of the beans. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Steam-Powered Espresso Machine: Crema?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Hi there fellow coffee lovers! So, I recently decided to purchase my first ever espresso machine (well, kind of)! Its a steam espresso machine made my Mr. Coffee®. I know its a beginner machine, so I plan on upgrading to a pump machine in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it surprisingly makes pretty good espresso! It takes really pleasant, but its missing on major element of a good espresso shot: the crema!! I simply fill the portafilter with espresso ground coffee up to the appropriate level. It seems like I grind about 2 and a half tablespoons for two ounces of water. I then "tamp" the coffee down with a flat spoon. I put it into my machine, turn it on, and wait like a minute for the hot espresso to come out. It sort of gives something similar to crema, but it seems for just like foam, and it doesn't last very long either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to generate crema using a steam espresso machine, or is it really not possible? Am I doing something wrong? Any feedback is appreciated! Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons why you might not get a good crema:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stale coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee not ground fine enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pressure too low&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a steam-powered espresso machine (especially if it's an entry level machine), you will typically not reach high enough pressure to get a proper crema. The crema is formed by oils extracted from the ground coffee, which needs high pressure (something like 9 bars). Your steam-powered machine will probably not produce more than ~3 bars of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tamping with a spoon also seems not ideal, because it will be very difficult to achieve an even tamp. I cannot comment on how important that is for this particular machine, but with higher end pump machines it might lead to channeling and uneven extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much caffeine is lost after 24 hours?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Suppose I brew a 16 oz cup of coffee, take just one generous sip (one ounce), and then put the rest in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just how "stale" is my coffee, when I revisit it 24 hours later?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Caffeine does not break down (at any appreciable rate) when left alone in a drink. It requires the enzymes in your body to break it down, so when you take the drink out of the fridge, it'll be just as caffeinated as when you put it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, your drink will still be stale, because there are plenty of other organic compounds in the coffee that will break down over that time, affecting the taste. Also, assuming you reheat the coffee, the reheating will have further effects, making it taste very bitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either make yourself a smaller coffee (16oz is a lot!) or drink it all when it's fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A 2008 U. Colorado (Boulder) study*, suggests that merely holding warm drinks (vs. cold) can positively influence perception of people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is apparently some connection between the physical act of holding a warm drink and one's perception of the outside world. The association of warm beverages and positive feelings may underlie the sensation of relaxation as well, although I didn't find a study on precisely on point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the effect is physiological or psychological the authors weren't sure.     &lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently switched from a Bialetti Moka Express 3-cup stovetop espresso maker to a &lt;a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=de&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloer.de%2Fdruckversion.php%3Fuid%3D0%26id%3D19833"&gt;Cloer 5928&lt;/a&gt; espresso maker. It has an integrated heating unit, just like an electric kettle, so making a coffee is now much more energy-efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffee from the Bialetti was flawless (using a medium-fine grind of Starbucks espresso roast beans). Now I have a difficult time producing coffee that is not both overly thin (underextracted) and has an odd taste that I can't even describe (perhaps from overheating the ground coffee?). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new espresso maker takes some time to heat up (365 Watts of electric power), and then the coffee is pressed through relatively quickly in short bursts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a look at the funnel, it has a hole, unlike the funnel of the Bialetti. My questions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can the hole in the funnel have anything to do with the underextracted coffee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What could be the purpose of the hole anyway?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2wqIz.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2wqIz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Just guessing here, but the hole could keep the water from going up until it reaches a certain temperature. The amount of pressure from the steam varies on the temperature of the water, and if there weren't enough pressure, the water would recycle. However, if the pressure were greater, the velocity of the water would prevent it from dripping out of the hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could explain the bursts, since the pressure would rise and fall depending on the amount of water it pushed out. The more water that escapes, the more room there is left behind for pressure to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you mentioned a weird taste. Could it be metallic? If so, you could try letting the base sit in a strong coffee/water mixture for a couple days. The moka pot needs to be seasoned to prevent this taste, so I would recommend not washing it with soap - just rinse. My grandmother has never washed hers.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I maximize the time the "high" lasts?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I know it's individual, but in general (or at least, in average):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the main factors in how long does a coffee's "high" last? Can I deliberately make it last more than an hour? More than 3?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would prefer to actually drink as less as possible, so please consider that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If it makes it easier to answer: I'm 24, male, and my coffee intake is about one dose of espresso every other day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Without considering the amount or potency of the coffee as well as setting personal metabolism aside, you could adjust your coffee schedule according to your natural circadian rhythm, a methodology neuroscientist Steve Miller refers to as &lt;a href="http://neurosciencedc.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/the-best-time-for-your-coffee.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;chronopharmacology&lt;/a&gt;.  Essentially, you use the caffeine as a propellant to your natural &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; rhythm. &lt;a href="http://food-hacks.wonderhowto.com/how-to/youre-drinking-coffee-wrong-heres-really-maximize-your-daily-caffeine-boosts-0150662/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Gabrielle Taylor's article&lt;/a&gt; does a fine job of explaining this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you drink coffee during the time when your body is already releasing cortisol, it won't have as strong an effect. Ideally, you want to get your caffeine during the lulls between cortisol spikes—otherwise, you start to develop a tolerance and have to drink more to get the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you're on a regular sleep schedule, your cortisol levels naturally spike about an hour after you wake up. If you get up at 7 am, your body is naturally most awake between 8 and 9 in the morning, noon to 1 pm, and again around 5:30-6:30 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, based on a wake time of 7 am, the best times to drink your caffeine vehicle of choice are 9:30-11:30 am and 1:30-5:00 pm. Obviously you can adjust the schedule according to your own wake time if it's earlier or later.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What coffee and roast are best for tiramisu?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Tiramisu is a famous Italian desert made of, among others, mascarpone and coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an Italian desert, I believe that an Italian roast of some blend is best to match the rich mascarpone and alcohol tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a "standard" roast or blend combination?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;From a cooks perspective, I think it should be "espresso", or "caffè" not "coffee" in any good tiramisu recipe, which in turn would already suggest a type of beans and roast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the Italian term caffè denotes the strong black liquid you get from an esspesso machine or a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot"&gt;moka&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffee in a tiramisu has to be concentrated to supply enough flavour without soaking the ladyfingers or other bisquits used. (The same principle applies when you use a liquor.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When choosing the beans /the roast, the same rule as for wine applies: Use what you drink. And seriously, unless you are making an insane amount of tiramisu, you will be using only very little of one pack of coffee.&lt;br&gt;
I use whatever I choose for my Espresso (if I feel rich, I'll splurge on something from my local roaster, in a pinch the usual suspects like Illy or Lavazza, sometimes even a Starbucks Espresso roast &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;) and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in sort, get a classic Italian espresso roast, prepare it authentically and you should be fine. In a pinch, use another coffee, but make sure it is very strong. You'll need a few tablespoons tops for a standard tiramisu recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is stale coffee less healthy for you than fresh coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently read an article on &lt;a href="http://www.handground.com/grind/the-chemistry-of-grinding-coffee-beans"&gt;chemistry of grinding coffee beans&lt;/a&gt; and it suggests stale coffee might be less healthy than freshly-roasted coffee, in terms of micronutrient and antioxidant loss over time after roasting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument makes sense but I don't think there's been research specifically on the loss of antioxidants as coffee goes bad. I'm curious what you think... maybe we can use the "Wisdom of Crowds" to find the right answer. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: Lately, I was checking some unanswered questions. This one stands for a while. So, I decided to use the advantages of sitting in an academic office and sought the academic databases I can think of. Some of them are only accessible by abstract. However, I will try to copy the essence of them here without disturbing copyright rules of the publishers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first, I tried to understand the effect of going stale to the amount of antioxidants in coffee. It seems not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first reference is &lt;em&gt;"Antioxidant capacity, phenolic acids and caffeine contents of some commercial coffees available on the Romanian market."&lt;/em&gt; by Trandafir I., Nour V, and Ionica M.E. which you can read its abstract &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24167962" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. According to this article, total amount of antioxidants &lt;strong&gt;in a regular coffee sold in the market&lt;/strong&gt; is changing in between &lt;strong&gt;19.8 to 41.9 mg per gram&lt;/strong&gt; coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second reference is &lt;em&gt;"Recovery of Natural Antioxidants from Spent Coffee Grounds"&lt;/em&gt; by Alessia Panusa, Antonio Zuorro, Roberto Lavecchia, Giancarlo Marrosu, and Rita Petrucci which you can read its abstract &lt;a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf4005719" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. According to this article, total amount of antioxidants &lt;strong&gt;in the remains of the spent espresso waste&lt;/strong&gt; is changing in between &lt;strong&gt;17.07 to 35.52 mg per gram&lt;/strong&gt; coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I conclude that, even after brewing (chemically speaking; extraction or leaching) the antioxidant amount is not changing &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I tried to understand what changes the antioxidant level in coffee, if there exist something. Yes, there is one; here comes the third reference by Ayelign and Sabally, &lt;em&gt;"Determination of Chlorogenic Acids (CGA) in Coffee Beans using HPLC"&lt;/em&gt; which you can download a copy of it from &lt;a href="http://www.usa-journals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Ayelign_Vol12.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In this study, it is shown that the level of CGAs (an antioxidant) is &lt;strong&gt;dropped from 46.144 mg to 0.981 mg per gram coffee, more the coffee is roasted&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Triple heating of the Turkish coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;As a follow up on &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/2379/277"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; discussion of Turkish preparation, I'm wondering how to do the triple heating. This refers to the repeating sequence of heating the coffee in a cezve, and then letting it cool down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is about both stages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do I know when it's heated enough to take it off the fire, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how much should it be cooled down?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guides to brewing Turkish usually discuss that at the abstract level: heat + remove three times. I've been trying to do that, but my actions didn't seem to make sense. So right now I'm brewing it just once -- till the foam starts to rise, and enjoy it. But maybe I still can improve it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This will be a long answer. I expect that it wont be as good as I want at first. I may make corrections/additions afterwards. I am a native Turkish, drinking kgs of coffee each week and from a coffee addicted family for generations. Therefore, I count myself as a Turkish-coffee hobbyist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe to understand the two or three times boiling mystery of Turkish coffee, you must understand the whole Turkish-style extraction process. I tell you the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chemistry is simple: we are extracting some oils from the beans. Two known ways out there, pressure or heat. Turkish extraction is the traditional, genuine, historical heating way. Actually, it is probably the first and easiest way manhood used in history to prepare coffee (I believe both in Africa and then in Ottoman Empire).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you heat the beans to extract, you need lots of surface to extract efficiently. That's why you grind the beans as fine as possible. The electrical grinders are not always perfect. You may want to use a mortar after the grinding process to be sure if you don't have a Turkish grinder. (This is another topic, I think.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the aromatic oils you are trying to extract are not of one kind. There are several kinds. The drink you consume under the name of coffee is delicious if it includes many of them. So, you are trying to jail all of them into the water during the brewing process. But, wait... Some of them start to be released from the bean at 75 degrees Celsius, but some others have been already vaporized at 70 degrees Celsius! There must be a way of collecting all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bingo! You are right. It is the double (triple, quadruple, ...) heating process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should heat the water up to some point, extract a subset of the oils, separate them to your fincan (cup). Then repeat the process at a higher degree. Three times is the best practice among Turks. You may define your own temperature slots and repetition count but I think the algorithm is clear now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talking about best practice, let me show you a best practice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get you cezve (pot). Mine is stainless steel and thick. Your coffee should not boil on the edges first, it must start to boil from the center. (If this is not the case, either your cezve or your fire is problematic.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cr9ZC.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cr9ZC.jpg" alt="cezve"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a hand grinder, set it to the finest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xbZo.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xbZo.jpg" alt="hand grinder"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LPGhB.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LPGhB.jpg" alt="hand grinder setting"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measure the water with fincan (cup) (I prefer soft spring water) and fill your cezve. Traditional fincans are quite thin (in contrast to espresso cups) and porcelain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nlZBI.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nlZBI.jpg" alt="fincan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you fill in your cezve with water, add coffee on top. About one teaspoon per fincan is quite OK. (You may change). I don't recommend sugar for any kind of coffee, but it is your taste. If you want to add sugar, it is now or never.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fo8C2.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fo8C2.jpg" alt="Floating Turkish coffee"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see that fine grounded coffee will float and sink in time. Fire up and let the coffee sink by itself. Do not touch or stir. The amount of fire has little or no affect to the taste of Turkish coffee to my experience. There is an urban legend that states that Turkish coffee is best made in wood fire or very slowly in low temperatures, etc. It's nonsense. Then, every aromatic oil will evaporate eventually. You should be quick. These are just romantic/melancholic scenes for old days heard from grandfathers. This was my setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/njG5o.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/njG5o.jpg" alt="Fire setting for Turkish coffee"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, all coffee will eventually sink. This is an indicator. Your coffee is somewhat homogeneously distributed in water. Also you have a nice grease remains already on top of water. However, they cannot form a foam yet. Cause, we didn't stir it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qMNTQ.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qMNTQ.jpg" alt="Greasy sunk Turkish coffee"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start stirring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cDABM.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cDABM.jpg" alt="Stir the Turkish coffee"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, stop. Please check the foam. You have a quite nice foam already. Very very light color. No bubbles at all. It is not mature yet. If you want to be experienced in Turkish-style coffee brewing, look at that foam a lot. Follow its color and forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qXRWh.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qXRWh.jpg" alt="Foam of Turkish coffee"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stir again. For about a minute. Stirring keeps the foam intact. You may stop from time to time to check the color and then continue. It gets mature when you first see the red/fire color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the second image. Could you see the firefox there? Could you? Ok, now it is time for the first shot. Actually, I would like you to compare the second foam image with the one above. Try to figure out the differences. We started with light color, it turned out to red/fire color. We started with no bubbles, it has bubbles now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll pour some of the coffee to our fincans. I pour the foamy part and fill about 2/5 of my fincans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m9dF5.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m9dF5.jpg" alt="Stir the Turkish coffee for first heating"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I have enough foam and lots of oils to extract in my ground beans. I continue to heat and stir. Don't forget to stir and keep foam intact. This time the foam turns from red/fire to brown/coffee-bean-color. Still, I'm very far from boiling. Fill another 2/5 of your fincans. The fincans are nearly full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wpxrv.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wpxrv.jpg" alt="Heating and stirring Turkish coffee for the second time"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bKdNO.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bKdNO.jpg" alt="Turkish coffee in fincans after second heating is done"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to keep your attention to one point. At this point, you see the famous marbled foam of Turkish coffee for the first time. The reason is, you've mixed two different subsets of oils for the first time. Our final destination is to produce a coffee foam marbled with three colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rzz6J.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rzz6J.jpg" alt="Marbled foam of Turkish coffee"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we hardly have any foam left in our cezve. We are heating the coffee for the last shot. This will be very close to the boiling point. You can hardly see any foam now, but mostly bubbles. At one point, the boiling starts in the middle. Take the cezve out of the fire very quickly to prevent burning the coffee and pour the rest of the coffee to the fincans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(You really need to be quick, so I couldn't find time to focus and burnt the coffee a bit. Still, you can sense the boiling center. Sorry, for this picture and also I cannot provide a triple marbled foam for now as it burnt.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s5x26.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s5x26.jpg" alt="Nearly boiling Turkish coffee in cezve"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ShfJM.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ShfJM.jpg" alt="Turkish coffee in fincan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, there shouldn't be any grounds remain in cezve. Everything must be dissolved homogeneously in water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/atPpC.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/atPpC.jpg" alt="There shouldn&amp;#39;t be remains in the cezve"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, we prefer to serve Turkish coffee with half a sip of liquor of sharp tastes. Like mint, quince, sour cherry or bitter almond. This time, it was hazelnut liquor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MNzBS.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MNzBS.jpg" alt="Turkish coffee serving"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A correctly prepared Turkish coffee is not a suspension of coffee grounds in water. Coffee grounds lay at the bottom and never fill in your mouth. The drinkable part stays on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vQ91V.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vQ91V.jpg" alt="Turkish coffee layers"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final words:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This is it. I hope both theoretic and practical part helps people. Please leave comments so I can further advance this answer in time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I stop my Hario Skerton from squeaking when I grind beans?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My Hario Skerton is very new,  and has recently developed a squeak (like scratching a black board,  but less soul piercing)  that is only present when I grind beans. It's irritating,  but also mildly concerning.  Should it be squeaky? And how do I stop it? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It depends on "where" the squeaking is coming from. Two contact points that might squeak are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the burrs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; themselves and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the top part of the crank rod&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The good news is that the whole thing dis-/re-assembles rather easily, and in fact this is pretty much necessary for changing the coarseness setting. I'd suggest two possibilities based on my own Hario manual grinder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the ceramic burrs are squeaking, &lt;strong&gt;try grinding some very dark-roast beans&lt;/strong&gt; (E.g., French roast), which will have more oils on the surface than lighter-roast beans. Use a setting about as coarse as for drip coffee. This will naturally lubricate the bits that are rubbing together, and should reduce or eliminate the squeaking. I wouldn't recommend putting any (other) oil on the burr mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the crank is squeaking, take the top part of the crank apart as you would to change the coarseness setting. Remove the coarseness adjustment nut (looks like a toothed gear) completely. &lt;strong&gt;Oil the shaft and the top of the post through which the rod passes&lt;/strong&gt;, and make sure the oil is well distributed through the parts where the rod contacts. For the oil, I recommend using a food-grade mineral oil that you are comfortable with. Use a very small amount of oil (like a pinhead size drop in total). I wouldn't use a vegetable oil because it could become "gummy" or go rancid, and I wouldn't use anything non food-safe (e.g., not machine oil, not WD-40).&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>How to order cappuccino without whipped cream in France?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;On my travel in paris, I ordered a cappuccino at a local cafe. What I got, was a large cup of coffee with a tennis-ball-sized whipped cream on top, decorated with chocolate syrup. Being like most Finnish, I did drink the cup without complaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I feel I got served a cheap substitute for a cappuccino, I am not even sure if it was espresso but rather just filtered coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it because we were tourists, or the place being cheap, or was it just their local variation of cappuccino? I've always thought that cappuccino is supposed to have steamed milk foam on top, not cream from a can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How should I order my next cappuccino without insulting the waiter AND without whipped cream?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You probably just hit upon a place that simply didn't know what a cappuccino was, or lacked the facilities to prepare one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French coffee culture is a little different from Italian, but usually a cappuccino is much like what you'd expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://behind-the-french-menu.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/how-to-ordering-coffee-in-france-f.html"&gt;this exhaustive guide to French coffee culture&lt;/a&gt;, and it notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capuccino&lt;/em&gt; – A French cappuccino is thirty per cent espresso coffee, fifty per cent milk, twenty per cent froth and no whipped cream. If the cafe you are in adds whipped cream then you must be in a cafe catering to tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it sounds like you just had bad luck!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>My moka pot brew exploded. What did I do wrong?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Well the moka pot itself didn't explode, rather the coffee bursted out from the funnel of the collecting chamber and through the middle of the moka pot, splashing all my clothes and half of my kitchen with coffee stains (nobody got hurt). Before the explosion, the coffee was sipping through as usually very slowly and there was no sign at all of any pressure building up or that any explosion was about to happen.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this brew I had used a very fine fresh grind and almost boiling water. I had also cleaned the whole moka pot beforehand, as a I do every time.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could have caused this and what can I do to prevent such an accident from happening in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;While the grind could have been too fine, I suspect what happened is you overfilled the bottom chamber, and the water level was covering the safety valve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You really don't want the water level to go higher than the red line in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are the 4M's of espresso?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;"4M" is something that I have been heard of as a requirement set for tasty espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are these four important quality factors that affect the flavor of final espresso cup?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4M&lt;/strong&gt; is a term mainly used among Italians for espresso. It is a placeholder for four words that start with "M" in Italian that affects espresso preparation. &lt;a href="http://www.brewed-coffee.com/coffee/the-4ms-of-espresso/"&gt;Some information can be found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These M's are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miscela&lt;/strong&gt;: The coffee-blend; it covers the selection and blending of the beans as well as proper roasting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macinazione&lt;/strong&gt;: The grinder; proper grinding of the given blend and its usage when its still fresh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macchina&lt;/strong&gt;: The espresso-machine; usage of the given grounds with a proper espresso-machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mano&lt;/strong&gt;: Skill of the barista; usage of all above with skill.&lt;/li&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>What is a café allongé, and how is it pronounced?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My question is actually in reference to a JavaScript book by Reg Braithwaite titled "JavaScript Allongé". Obviously JavaScript has almost nothing to do with coffee, but the author maintained a coffee barista metaphor throughout the book and stated that allongé is some coffee variant. So for the uninitiated coffee drinkers out there among his readers, can you explain what an allongé is, what makes it unique, and how to actually pronounce it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author does offer a brief description quoted from &lt;em&gt;Caffe Molinari&lt;/em&gt; linked &lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read#leanpub-auto-a-pull-of-the-lever-prefaces" rel="noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but as a coffee newbie much of what is being described escapes me. Here is the quoted text from Braithwaite's preface:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Café Allongé, also called Espresso Lungo, is a drink midway between
  an Espresso and Americano in strength. There are two different ways to
  make it. The first, and the one I prefer, is to add a small amount of
  hot water to a double or quadruple Espresso Ristretto. Like adding a
  splash of water to whiskey, the small dilution releases more of the
  complex flavours in the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“The second way is to pull an extra long double shot of Espresso. This
  achieves approximately the same ratio of oils to water as the dilution
  method, but also releases a different mix of flavours due to the
  longer extraction. Some complain that the long pull is more bitter and
  detracts from the best character of the coffee, others feel it
  releases even more complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“The important thing is that neither method of preparation should use
  so much water as to result in a sickly, pale ghost of Espresso.
  Moderation in all things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Café allongé&lt;/strong&gt; is the French for Italian &lt;strong&gt;cafe lungo&lt;/strong&gt;, or in English, &lt;strong&gt;long espresso&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be previous related answers on this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2562/i-run-my-espresso-machine-until-my-whole-cup-is-full-whats-my-coffee-called"&gt;I run my espresso machine until my whole cup is full. What&amp;#39;s my coffee called?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2959/what-are-the-standard-espresso-parameters-dose-mass-volume-time-etc"&gt;What are the standard espresso parameters (dose, mass/volume, time, etc.)?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, of course a &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how to write in the pronounciation alphabet, but it is pronounced something similar to "a-lawn-jee".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, it is prepared in a bit longer time than normal espresso. So, the second explanation given in the book is the standard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is more &lt;em&gt;sophisticated&lt;/em&gt; and uncommon with many side flavors in it. People who are into coffee mostly prefer pure coffee. However, as the author likes it that way, probably he uses such a metaphor in his book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(As computer scientists know, JavaScript is &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/125367/dynamic-type-languages-versus-static-type-languages"&gt;dynamically typed&lt;/a&gt; which may cause many undesirable &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; according to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;type theory&lt;/a&gt;. I assume, the second recipe is more suitable to be used as a metaphor for a programming language that has &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;type system&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/getting-started-with-haskell"&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt; maybe?)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee and the singing voice</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Can anyone tell me what the reputation of coffee is for serious, professional singers? Does it, as it has been suggested to be, dry out the human vocal chords?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Caffein, which is the main active ingredient in coffee is known to be dehydrating. However there is no conclusive scientific evidence that caffein intake in normal dosages has detrimental effects on the quality of your voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One study by Akthar et al. (1999) showed that the ingestion of 250mg of caffein, which corresponds to 2 to 3 cups of coffee, produced alteration in the voice of 8 individuals. I would take this result with a grain of salt though, since a study performed with only 8 subjects, without control group or anything, can hardly be called representative or conclusive in any way. Also they say that the effect produced varied substantially between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another study by Franca et al. (2013) is showing that the ingestion of 100mg of caffein shortly before using your voice does not have any negative effect on the quality of your voice. I think this is a more plausible study design, 100mg corresponds to a cup of coffee and the experiment is controlled with one group taking placebos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally a recent review (Alves et al. 2017) of the literature on dehydration and vocal quality found that dehydration is, surprise, bad for your voice. They also found however that "systematic hydration is the easiest [...] solution to improve voice quality".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus I would conclude, that as long as you take care to stay hydrated, meaning drinking water with your coffee (which everyone should do in any case) moderate amounts of coffee consumption will likely not have any detrimental effect on your voice quality. The evidence for that seems to be mainly anecdotal and not scientific. If you struggle with some vocal chord disease for example or you are in recovery of one, maybe coffee could be ill-advised. Akthar et al. (1999) hint to something like that. There's no proof that it's damaging in those cases either, but just for the sake of being overly careful rather than ending up doing damage (anyways it would likely be only temporary) to your voice, if you are professionally dependent on it, maybe restrain from coffee consumption in cases of diseases etc.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I brew french roast coffee, so that it doesn't taste like ash</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been given (as a gift) a large (40 oz ~ 1.13kg) bag of Starbucks French Roast coffee.&lt;br /&gt;
To me it looks, smells and tastes like a burnt coffee.&lt;br /&gt;
I usually brew coffee in a moka-pot, french press or paper filter.&lt;br /&gt;
I do enjoy darker roasted, Italian espresso, but this French Roast is just too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I brew it, to get rid of these unpleasant flavors and aromas, so I can enjoy it and not throw away 1kg of coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/giwUe.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/giwUe.png" alt="Starbucks French Roast" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Starbucks' dark roasts are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; dark. It tastes like ash because it contains ash. There's no way around that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, you can minimize the ashy notes in your brew by using the below suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower the brew temperature--cold brew in particular works well for this purpose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a coarser grind setting when grinding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If using a hot brew method, reduce the time you let the coffee brew&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use just the first or some combination of all three. It'll take experimentation to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Are there any ways that coffee consumers can measure the caffeine content of what they are drinking by themselves?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;As a consumer of coffee from several different sources (made at home, from a coffee shop, out of a fancy designer can at a convenience store), I have often wondered about their relative caffeine content; &amp;quot;Does three of these equal two of those?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end I'd like to ask if there are any ways that coffee consumers can &lt;em&gt;measure&lt;/em&gt; caffeine content of what they are drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not asking if there are tables out there or ways to look some of them up or estimate the caffeine content of these coffees, I'd like to know if there's any way that a particularly nerdy consumer can measure it themselves, even if it requires a bit of an investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked this in Chemistry SE many years ago to no avail:&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It really depends on your budget. You say you are fine with a bit of an investment - how does 2500$ sound?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that price you can get a &lt;a href="https://new.sca.coffee/entries/lighttells-ca-700-caffeine-cga-analyzer" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Lighttells CA-700&lt;/a&gt; which lets you analyze the caffeine content in your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may sound expensive but compared to the other caffeine testing equipment out there it's relatively cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on how far down the coffee rabbit hole you are, you may have heard of James Hoffmann - he recently &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etnMr8oUSDo" rel="noreferrer"&gt;made a video&lt;/a&gt; about exactly what you are trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid this is currently the cheapest method to get reliable, repeatable and somewhat precise results in measuring caffeine content.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Are reused glass jars ever fit for storing ground coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for some small container to store small amounts of ground coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of jars after some other things, like olives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can they ever be fit for storing ground coffee? Is it possible to remove all side odours from them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If so, how should I clean them before using them for coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original package is not very tight after opening, so the jar would better prevent the contact with the air... &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The Short answer  to this is no. You should not use a glass jar for storing coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt; The base of the answer can be found here: &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off/166#166"&gt;When Does Coffee Go Off?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee goes stale relatively quickly, and the transfer to a glass jar will: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase the coffee's interaction and exposure to oxygen &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase the coffee's exposure to light, which will cause rancidification of the oils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, you should only be purchasing and storing whole bean coffee - as pre-ground coffee is already stale. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Coffee is a pure and natural product, consisting only of water and
  roasted coffee bean extract. Unsweetened black coffee is naturally low
  in calories ( &amp;lt;1 kcal). No additives are present in our capsules.
  Adding milk to the coffee can bring additional nutritional benefits to
  the coffee. Milk is a good source of various essential nutrients.
  Nevertheless, milk, cream and sugar provide calories which might
  become significant if regularly consumed.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it safe to brew old coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I found a 10 year old package of coffee. Is it safe to brew it? Or should I get a new one?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If it's refrigerated, it'll last for at least a week, as long as you didn't pre-dairy it.
  Unrefrigerated, I wouldn't trust it for more than a day. Coffee is a crappy growth medium        and it should start out the next best thing to sterile, but, even covered, its going to start to get moldy.
  Obviously if you add dairy, then you're dealing with that dairy shelf-life, and that isn't very long at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, is your idea of going bad that it has a funny taste and is not as fresh as it once was, or is it that it actually tastes as though it is spoiled? Yes, coffee can go stale when it comes to taste, but it won’t actually be spoiled or dangerous to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your coffee is opened and introduced to oxygen, the shelf life timer begins to tick. Storing coffee in hot, humid, or sunlight areas will only make matters worse. The best way to keep your coffee fresh is to store it in a container that is air tight and will remain cool – but not in the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you typically buy your coffee ground for you? With a far greater surface area of coffee coming in contact with the oxygen, those grounds are going to stale much quicker than whole beans will. I highly recommend investing in a hand or electric grinder to experience the fresh taste and aroma of beans you’ve ground yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When coffee goes bad, it can become bitter and even rancid. Every bean will react differently to oxidation. If you start to notice your expertly roasted beans losing quality and general yumminess, it may be time to buy some fresh beans. Don’t know how to find amazing, fresh coffee? I wrote a guide on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what you do, you will not be able to get that fresh flavor back once it has left the bean. The most important thing to do is keep it locked up tight. However, if you are a true coffee lover, it may not sit around long enough to even think about going bad. Just remember this rule of thumb: about two weeks after roast the coffee will start decaying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would close this question as "Too broad" but then.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to weaken effects of caffeine after consumption</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yesterday I had a way too big, way too strong cup of 100% Robusta.&lt;/strong&gt; I had never tried pure Robusta before, so I had no idea what I was getting into. I experienced strong caffeine effects 6+ hours after consumption, and had mildly shaking hands + felt a little ill for six more hours (and then I went to bed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm fine now, but &lt;strong&gt;what could I have done (or eaten, drunk) to weaken the effects of said cup?&lt;/strong&gt; There are "home remedies" for hangovers, and if one has eaten too spicy food, bread is usually good. What works on caffeine?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;What you experienced was a &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002579.htm"&gt;caffeine overdose&lt;/a&gt;, however mild, and that's something that you shouldn't really try home remedies to correct. Had you gone to the emergency room, you probably could have expected to been given a laxative, activated charcoal, and possibly I.V. fluids. I doubt that they would have pumped your stomach over a single cup, but they might have if your heart was beating irregularly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absorption of most things you swallow generally depends on how much you've had to eat - so yes, eating something filling (e.g. bread soaked in water) would &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; have alleviated some of the discomfort, especially if you had the coffee on an empty stomach. Staying hydrated (but not over-hydrated) would also have been important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't advise self-medicating in circumstances like this, all you can do is be very mindful of symptoms getting &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; (particularly any sign of irregular heart activity) while you wait it out and (eventually) crash into bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, bread / crackers / water - not going to hurt, and &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; make you feel a little better, or better sooner. While symptomatic, I wouldn't take anything over the counter or prescription unless you checked with a doctor (because of possible heart implications)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And really, if you feel at all beyond 'blaugh' - you should see a doctor quickly. People die from too much caffeine, and it's not pretty, so be careful.&lt;/p&gt;

Whole bags within arms' reach will vanish. Am I ingesting a dangerous amount of caffeine? How much caffeine is there in a (~150g) bag of chocolate coffee beans compared to a pull of espresso?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g4pTd.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/coffee-beans"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; seems to suggest that there is approximately 7mg of caffeine per coated bean.  I've no idea how much those weight per piece, or how many are in a bag, but the math should be fairly easy if you have access to such things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found another manufacturer of a similar product which claims 40g for 28 pieces. Extrapolating that for your 150g bags gives roughly 700mg of caffeine, which sounds like way too much.  This could very greatly of course between manufacturers depending on chocolate thickness/weight.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As an avid composter I can say that I have always used lots of coffee grounds and my compost has always done well with it. There are a few reasons why it is beneficial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;used grounds are fairly pH neutral. If your compost is too acidic they even help a little by absorbing extra acid. Unused grounds however would add to acidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coffee grounds are considered "green material" in compost lingo which is usually what compost piles need more of, as opposed to brown material that is fairly abundant in average land plots (maybe not for apartment composters).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coffee grounds attract worms, so even if some bacteria are harmed the worms are compost rock-stars and they make up for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb with composting is everything in moderation, so there is such thing as too much used coffee in the pile. When I empty my indoor compost bin into the outside bin coffee is generally 10-25% of that green material. If it is more than 50% you probably need to reduce the amount to compost or find more green material sources.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is "cold brew" an oxymoron?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Dictionaries seem to agree that brewing requires &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt; water. I have checked definitions in the &lt;em&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary&lt;/em&gt;, the (British) &lt;em&gt;Oxford Dictionary of English&lt;/em&gt;, and a thesaurus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how about the expression we most use for getting a coffee drink out of cold water: "cold brew" ?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes, the term is an oxymoron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/brew"&gt;Miriam Webster&lt;/a&gt; agrees with your definition of brewing involving hot water:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;to prepare (as tea) by infusion in hot water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why the word &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; is used as a qualifier to show that it is done with cold water rather than hot water.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Other uses for espresso machines?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I own a espresso machine and was wondering if there are any other beverages besides coffee which could be produced using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, using the hot water tap to get hot water for tea is quite obvious. But what other things could be produced, especially using the sieve and the high pressure the machine offers?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It may completely be abuse of the machine, but I saw someone clean stainless steel jewelry once in an ECM machine. They put the jewelry in a sealed portafilter basket and backflushed the machine with cleaning detergent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed to clean the jewelry pretty well, but I can't say if it would be very different from putting it in the dishwasher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, it seems to be a way to kill two birds with one stone when backflushing your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are the side effects of drinking too much coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Are there any side effects when you drink too much strong coffee? Is it dangerous?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In example, if I drink &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2641608/Is-worlds-expensive-Starbucks-coffee-Sexagintuple-Vanilla-Bean-Mocha-Frappuccino-set-55.html"&gt;the world's most expensive Starbucks coffee (costing $55/£33) featuring 60 espresso shots&lt;/a&gt; at one go, would I have any side effects (which kind)? Would I risk my life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew told the Consumerist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;'I gotta say, it was delicious.'
  However, he did concede he was unable to drink it all in one go.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Caffeinated beverages like coffee and soft drinks give short bursts of energy, but can actually cause fluid loss. Caffeine has been shown to temporarily raise blood pressure, and reduces blood flow to inactive limbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many drugs, caffeine is &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/05/us/yes-people-are-right-caffeine-is-addictive.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;chemically addictive&lt;/a&gt; and recent publication of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), caffeine withdrawal was finally included as a mental disorder for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after you drink coffee (containing caffeine), it’s absorbed through the small intestine and dissolved into the bloodstream and it’s able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular ingestion of the drug (i.e. coffee/tea, soda or energy drinks) alters your brain’s chemistry and physical characteristics actually change over time, leading to fatigue, headaches and nausea if you try to quit. However, compared to many drug addictions, the effects are relatively short-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few quotes from &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2792690/sales-sugar-caffeine-laden-energy-drinks-restricted.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large amounts of &lt;strong&gt;caffeine can cause heart palpitations, fits and even death&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as raising the risk of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy consumption has also been linked to &lt;strong&gt;a greater risk of depression, addiction and alcohol dependency&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy drinks could be more likely to cause a caffeine overdose because they can be drunk quickly, unlike hot drinks like tea or coffee, the Energy Drink Consumption in Europe study said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several deaths worldwide have been linked to excessive consumption of energy drinks, although scientists say more research is needed to prove a link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended maximum caffeine intake is about 400mg per day – equivalent to around five cups of filter coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Reproductive-aged women (? 300 mg caffeine per day) and children are ‘at risk’ subgroups who may require specific advice on moderating their caffeine intake', &lt;a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content%7Edb=all%7Econtent=a713811152?waited=0" rel="noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/34765-coffee-drinking-is-mental-disorder-dsm.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Live Science&lt;/a&gt; we can read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee drinking could lead to a mental disorder. If you experience
five or more symptoms, such as red face, nervousness and restlessness,
during or right after your cup of Joe, you may be diagnosed with
coffee intoxication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a new edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), excessive caffeine intake can lead to a condition known as “caffeine intoxication,”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;strong&gt;caffeine withdrawal is now a recognized disorder, and is listed in the &lt;a href="http://www.dsm5.org/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;DSM-5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine is a drug, a mild stimulant&lt;/strong&gt;, which is used by almost
everybody on a daily basis,” said Dr. Charles O’Brien, who chairs the
Substance-Related Disorder Work Group for DSM-5 (via New York Post).
“But it does have a letdown afterwards. If you drink a lot of coffee,
at least two or three [236 ml] cups at a time, there will be a rebound
or withdrawal effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are &lt;a href="http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-withdrawal-symptoms-top-ten" rel="noreferrer"&gt;top 10 caffeine withdrawal symptoms&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Home roaster cleaning and/or seasoning</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Gene Cafe that I have been using at home for some time.  On inital reading of the directions, it recommends washing the roasting chamber:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oils and residual debris remaining from the roasting process will
  build up and adversely affect the taste of future batches. Clean the
  chamber using a dish washing brush, sponge and dish washing liquid.
  Dry the chamber completely before storing it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I know that there is a lot of juju surrounding the seasoning of commercial roasters.  I've wiped the inside out on a couple of occasions with a cloth when I've accidently over roasted and ended up with  a lot of oil in there.  If I leave a lot of oil in the chamber, it seems to shorten the end roast times of future batches (they move through the later stages of roasting too quickly to be well controlled).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically, to clean, or not to clean?  &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The roasting chamber of your Gene Cafe is &lt;strong&gt;made of Pyrex&lt;/strong&gt; (heat-resistant tempered glass), and leaving the old oils to accumulate and burn will cause the the inside of the drum to turn black. The darker material will likely change your roasting time, and the fouled glass will not allow you to monitor your roasts. &lt;strong&gt;Glass does not need "seasoning"&lt;/strong&gt;, so it should be cleaned regularly per the manufacturer's recommendations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seasoning&lt;/em&gt; is typically a way to create a stick-resistant coating on a &lt;em&gt;porous&lt;/em&gt; metal surface (like cast iron or carbon steel). When a thin layer of fat or oil is heated on these surfaces, it forms a polymer which provides rust protection and creates a non-stick surface that will keep whatever you are cooking/roasting from reacting with the cooking surface (the &lt;em&gt;juju&lt;/em&gt; you mentioned above). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the roasting chamber were made of cast iron or carbon steel, seasoning would be recommended. But neither glass nor stainless steel need seasoning, and you're just changing the built-in characteristics of your roaster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep your roaster in optimal roasting condition, keep your glass roasting chamber clean.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What influence do the dry residuals of previous coffee in the cup have on the drinking experience?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;At work I usually drink coffee (multiple times daily) from a metallic cup which I actually never ever wash on the inside. This leads to the building of interesting dust-like coffee residuals. While this started out of mere laziness, I meanwhile deliberately refrain from washing it as the result is visually quite appealing and an interesting long-term endeavour to see how that coffee cup evolves over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am however wondering &lt;strong&gt;if those residuals actually have any kind of influence on the fresh coffee drank from this cup&lt;/strong&gt;. Now of course there isn't anything moulding, it's an entirely dry thin dust layer, and I don't really make out any taste difference to a clean cup (as the coffee isn't too much of a high quality product in the first place and I'm not a big tasting expert either). So this might be a stupid question. But for example I heard somewhere (though, that's entirely anecdotal hearsay, too) that you shouldn't wash a tea can with dishwasher but only with water because of some flavoury reasons. So maybe there is actual proper or even scientifically grounded reasoning that the &lt;strong&gt;dry residuals of previous coffee in the cup have any kind of influence on the coffee drinking experience, however small and imperceptible, be that flavour-wise or regarding other effects, advantageous or defective&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You're actually asking two different questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minute amount of coffee left to evaporate in the bottom of a cup will have completely oxidized and lost virtually all of its volatile compounds (i.e. It probably wouldn't taste very good if you reconstituted it on its own). So when you add more &lt;em&gt;fresh&lt;/em&gt; coffee to that cup, yes, you are essentially adding a minute amount of an external (and somewhat &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;) flavor component to your brew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now whether that flavor component contributes to any any &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;perceptible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; change in flavor is highly debatable. Line up 100 coffee drinkers in a blind tasting, and I suspect there would be no statistically significant detection between &lt;em&gt;"100% fresh"&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;"Christian's 0.083% dust-like coffee residuals."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your analogy to washing tea cans in a dishwasher is a bit off. Washing containers in a dishwasher is generally known to leave a perceptible taste of &lt;em&gt;soap&lt;/em&gt; on the container. Soap is completely foreign to the coffee-tasking experience so it is easily &lt;em&gt;tasted&lt;/em&gt; if it is present. But the residuals you are leaving behind in your unwashed-coffee-cup study are still &lt;em&gt;essentially&lt;/em&gt; coffee (somewhat &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; coffee, but coffee nonetheless). So mixing the equivalent of "a few drops" of &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; coffee in a hot cup of fresh I suspect will have no &lt;em&gt;perceptible&lt;/em&gt; effect on taste. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also suspect that your coffee cup experiment is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; evolving over the years. The metallic cup is likely stainless steel or perhaps aluminum (and most coffee cups are made of ceramic). In either case, the cup is largely &lt;em&gt;stainless&lt;/em&gt;, so you are not likely building up any patina&amp;hellip; so you are essentially "washing away" the previous day's experiment each time you add a fresh cup of hot coffee. There should be no substantial, cumulative effect.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How does sugar influence the taste?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been told that sugar adds a &lt;em&gt;sour&lt;/em&gt; taste to the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I do not put sugar at all in my coffee but I was wondering for the sake of curiosity... Also I always preach to people that do put sugar in about how it ruins their coffee, due to the sour after-taste the sugar is adding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any chemical reaction here between the sugar and the coffee? Is it a result of a mixture between bitter and sweet that creates the sour taste?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I tried having coffee without sugar I did feel like there is this sour feeling to it, but I also sometimes taste it with espresso made from some blends.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugar adds a sweet taste to coffee,&lt;/strong&gt; not a sour taste.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste#Sourness" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sourness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetness" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;sweetness&lt;/a&gt; are rather separate &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;tastes&lt;/a&gt;! Different flavours will to some extent interact with each other, and individual preference and taste have something to do with this, but there are particular causes of certain flavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sourness&lt;/em&gt; is a perception of &lt;em&gt;acidity&lt;/em&gt;. In high enough quantities, sugar can overwhelm the perception of acidity (e.g., &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cola" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;cola&lt;/a&gt; has a pH ~2.5, but doesn't taste sour because the perception is overwhelmed by sugar/sweetness; see also &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/17395/why-does-adding-sugar-to-sour-things-cause-them-not-to-be-sour"&gt;this Seasoned Advice question on sugar reducing perception of sourness&lt;/a&gt;). I don't see how sugar could be &lt;em&gt;the cause&lt;/em&gt; of sourness (i.e., sugar is not acidic). &lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; That said, it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be the case that this is a temporal situation. Sugar &lt;em&gt;reduces&lt;/em&gt; the perception of sourness, but it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be the case this change is temporary: For example, if the sweetness (sugar) &lt;em&gt;dissipates more quickly&lt;/em&gt; than the sourness (acids), you might be left with "more sourness than sweetness" in the &lt;em&gt;aftertaste&lt;/em&gt; after some time. That is, you're left with "un-maksked" residual sourness which, though present all along, is more &lt;em&gt;perceptible&lt;/em&gt; after the sugar has dissipated. However, all of this is entirely speculation; I have no justification for this, and haven't found any supporting information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweetness&lt;/em&gt; is perceived by the presence of &lt;em&gt;sugar&lt;/em&gt; (and/or other chemicals that happen to interact in similar ways with sweetness &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoreceptor" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;perception&lt;/a&gt;). Sugar will also impact mouthfeel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste#Bitterness" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Bitterness&lt;/a&gt; is separate also; see &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/495/does-adding-salt-to-coffee-reduce-bitterness"&gt;this question on salt and bitterness in coffee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think there are any chemical changes to the sugar happening in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can you practice latte art with UHT milk?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I want to practise my latte art skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, using fresh milk is quite expensive so my solution was to use long-life (UHT) milk, which is quite a bit cheaper than using fresh milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will using UHT milk somehow affect this negatively?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know of any other cost-effective ways of practising latte art?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Back then when i got my first espresso machine i was recommended a method using a pinch of dishwashing soap in a pitcher with water. This way i was able to practice and enhance my frothing skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to find the correct dose of soap and be aware that soap residue can stick to the steamwand, so remember to clean it by purging the same way as you would froth milk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this method much more suitable than wasting a lot milk if you intend to do it a couple of times a day for practicing.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does the filtrate sometimes well up in the upper cone when using the Chemex coffeemaker</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When using the glass-handled 6-cup &lt;em&gt;Chemex&lt;/em&gt; like this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Il8CQ.jpg" alt="Chemex 6-cup, glass-handle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the appropriate &lt;em&gt;Chemex&lt;/em&gt; conical paper filter, the filtrate (liquid that has passed through the coffee and the filter) sometimes wells up between the filter and the upper glass cone of the carafe. This slows down the flow of liquid dripping into the bottom of the carafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually resolve the issue by gently lifting the filter (with coffee and water in it) away from the glass for a second which allows the accumulated filtrate to drop into the bottom of the carafe. So it is not a fatal issue, but I'd still like to know why this tends to happen. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science!&lt;/strong&gt; What follows is my bogus hypothesis, with pictures (annotated in the &lt;a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/19775/262760"&gt;conventional style&lt;/a&gt;) and annotations to bolster my unsubstantiated claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other (non-Chemex) cone-style (and basket-style) filters often have ridges down the inside of the cone. It seems that these ridges serve two purposes: to provide channels down which the coffee can flow, and to help "wick" the coffee away from the filter. This seems to help the coffee drain faster. This is probably due to properties of water like cohesion, adhesion, surface tension, and perhaps capillary action (legitimacy of these claims is left as an exercise to the reader).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrasting the two types of cones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;between a ceramic cone filter (white, left) and the Chemex cone (glass, right). I think the ridges prevent the "wells" from forming.  With a flat surface (like the Chemex), the filter somehow "seals" itself against the side of the cone, restricting the flow of coffee well enough to cause the pooling you describe. I assume this happens because the grounds get packed solidly at the bottom of the cone, and perhaps expand slightly. I don't have a better answer for "why" this seal happens. Lifting the filter (as you describe) breaks the "seal" and permits the coffee to drain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way that I sometimes resolve the issue is to slide a bamboo skewer (or stir-stick, or chop-stick, etc.) between the filter and the Chemex cone (careful not to tear the filter!). This seems to work by providing a similar "ridge" that the other cone filters provide; it prevents the coffee-pockets from forming next to the skewer. I have also tried to fold little "pleats" in the filter, but it's annoying and doesn't work all that well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that this "pooling" happens more often when I use a finer grind. I think a finer grind packs itself down more in the bottom of the cone and clogs up the filter more quickly. Both of these could believably cause the "sealing," but I don't have any other real evidence. It also drains more slowly in other drip brewing methods also. For these reasons I use a coarser grind when using the Chemex than when I'm brewing pour-over with the ridged cone filter. In fact, the &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Blue Bottle Chemex brewing guide&lt;/a&gt; suggests a much coarser grind than regular filter coffee, like that of French press. Maybe that's for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pour-spout on the Chemex helps with this a little by allowing steam/air to escape from the bottom chamber. A pre-wet filter can sometimes slide down into the pour-spout and nearly seal it, which will also make it more difficult for the coffee to drain, but it sounds like that's not what's happening in your particular case.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is a good recipe for high quality coffee beans that are no longer fresh?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a subscription to a roaster who mails me a 250g bag of freshly-roasted, single origin coffee beans every week. To my taste, the beans are best within the first 20 days after roasting after which the aroma declines pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when I travel for instance, I end up with bags that I wasn't able to use by the time a fresher bag arrives. The older beans are not bad by any stretch-- in fact they are still far better than 99% of the beans that are sold in supermarkets which are generally a year old-- but I'd always rather use the fresher beans to make coffee if I have the choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any good recipes or preparations that could put these once-fresh beans to good use?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;One option is a somewhat obscure preparation method, but one that works best with older-ish beans: Nel drip (nel pot) preparation recommends beans that are a few weeks old; here's &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/nel-drip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a Nel preparation guide from Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know why older beans are recommended, except perhaps tradition. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I achieve a very bitter flavor using the French press?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to train my tongue to recognize the 'bitter' taste of coffee, so I can improve my methods.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I achieve a bitter flavor with a French press?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a real question as I am not sure if it is heat, steep time, or the coffee grounds that produce the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Bitterness comes from over-extracting the coffee. The factors affecting extraction are: water temperature, time, size of the grind, and to a lesser extent, agitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using hotter water (above the usual 198F-202F), longer steep time, or a finer grind--or any combination of the three--will result in over-extraction, which will make the coffee more bitter. A darker roast will over-extract more easily as well, since an ideal extraction is typically 30-45 seconds shorter than a light roast.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Kopi Luwak - real or not?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I bought a coffee from a Duty free shop in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100g for ~14 USD&lt;/strong&gt;, available on ebay for 23 USD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mandailing estate coffee
Special Blends

Wild Kopi Luwak
Gibbon ridge estate

Mandailing Sumatra
Product of etc etc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it is? Is it real for this price? Is it blended with kopi non-luwak? Like only 1 or 5 percent of kopi luwak? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it from wild luwaks? Website says yes, how does one know? They also have a video on youtube of a guy picking up excrements with his hand from a grass in a jungle. Why that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also had some little more expensive one in a box (this one is a bag), not sure if it was only a different packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gJTDd.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gJTDdm.jpg" alt="front"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I actually might say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of coffee is rather expensive at &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=kopi%20luwak%20price"&gt;$100 to &lt;strong&gt;$600&lt;/strong&gt; per US pound&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, 100 to 600 USD. This is natural Kopi Luwak coffee at a normal price. The word &lt;em&gt;blend&lt;/em&gt; sounds a little fishy to me, as it usually means that it is not entirely pure Kopi Luwak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, it's really up to you to decide for yourself. If you can trust them, buy it. If you think the product isn't what you want, don't buy it. I will probably say no, but you make the final decision. Go with your gut and say yes or no to buying that product. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

How specifically does it affect the flavor and does the same apply to water filtered by reverse osmosis?&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I've heard that the mineral content in water assists in the distribution of the particulate that's extracted when brewing coffee. While I've not used distilled water, I have used reverse osmosis water (I live in an area with very hard water). I tend to prefer using the reverse osmosis water to the tap water. I don't particularly care for the taste of distilled water on its own, which is why I have avoided using it in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does using two paper filters in a drip machine strengthen flavour?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;From time to time, I find myself somewhere, where I have to make coffee using a drip machine. Often it is one that takes flat-bottom, paper filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I am in this situation, I am usually working with a weak coffee. To strengthen the taste of the coffee, I reason that using two paper filters instead of one will increase the extraction time of the coffee (which I prefer in this setting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will using two paper filters actually have a significant change on coffee extraction time? Or is the difference insignificant? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes, because it allows more time for coffee to be extracted as it stored in a longer time for coffee to drip. However, other parameters also have effect regarding this issue (such as, type of bean, roasting profile, temperature, brewing method)
But using double filter since it also filter the "flavor", making it stale (you may lose the pleasant acidic, fruity flavor, or other unique flavor your bean may offered) and double filter can make your coffee over extracted thus unpleasant bitter flavor. 
If you want your coffee strong you may want other experiment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use fresh coffee bean&lt;/strong&gt;
the older the coffee, they tend to lose their flavor. The fresher, the better. You have to store your bean properly too, keep it in air-tight container, avoid direct sunlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wait  to grind your bean, until the last minute&lt;/strong&gt; coffee lose a bit of its flavor after grinding. Ground coffee is also more sensitive to the moisture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use different kind of bean&lt;/strong&gt; You may use robusta, it naturally has more "caffeine" compared to Arabica, therefore can "hit" you harder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use different kind of roasting profile&lt;/strong&gt; the darker the roast, the bitter it is, but it has less caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when brewing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-warming the equipment or insulating it&lt;/strong&gt; basically the hotter the temperature you get bitter flavor, to avoid the "upleasant bitter" you may adjust the water temperature according to your preferences. Temperature loss often occurs as a result of heat absorption by the equipment itself (and therefore stale flavor), so pre-heat the equipment would prevent it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use finer grind&lt;/strong&gt; Coarser grind can make your coffee under extracted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjust the amount of your coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjust the steeping time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end it comes down to your preference(s). No single technique is right for everyone. Enjoy your coffee immediately after brewing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My explanation might not answer your question directly, double filter affect your coffee, yes it is. But other factors simply can be neglected&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is my new Baratza Virtuoso producing too many fines?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just received a new Baratza Virtuoso - the first automatic coffee grinder I've ever owned. Every single review I've read said it's exceptional grinder, and produces very few fines, which I understand are detrimental to the quality of the coffee brewed. I was thus hoping I'd get a more consistent grind quality than my Hario hand mill. Unfortunately, the grind consistency appears to be slightly worse, and I think I can see lot of fines and variance in grind size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I'm new to this, so it could be that I have unrealistic expectations from a $229 grinder. My question is: is my Baratza Virtuouso defective, or is the grind of the quality normally expected from this grinder?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a photo of some grinds at setting 14 (I intend to use this setting for drip coffee). (The photo is high enough resolution to be zoomed quite a bit.) The photo shows what seems to me to be inconsistent grind sizes, and many fines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QMeeQ.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QMeeQ.jpg" alt="Photo of grinds" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed Baratza's advice and ground 1/4lb of coffee in order the 'break in' the grinder. Here are some grinds after that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pJNrf.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pJNrf.jpg" alt="Grinds after break-in" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my eyes, there still seem to be a lot of fines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot! I hope you can help me decide whether or not to return the grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h2&gt;The Problem with Consumer Burr grinders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burr grinders (that aren't of a very high or industrial quality) generally do not produce even grinds. I usually recommend a spinning blade grinder to the home barista for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Evaluating Your Grinds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You indicated that you will be using a drip machine with a paper filter. In my opinion, based on what I can see in the picture where the machine has been broken in, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; think that these grinds are fine for a paper filter drip machine.&lt;/strong&gt; There are a decent number of fine grinds, but I think it's alright for your purposes. If you plan to use another type of machine though, it may not be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were using an espresso machine or a french press, you would have problems here (which I will not get into here). This might even be true for a permanent filter drip machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My Assessment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know that you are only going to use this for paper filter drip coffee, keep it. It seems to be pretty good for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever want to branch out into espresso or french press coffee, I recommend returning it and getting a better one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Final Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember it all comes down to you and taste. If you are satisfied with the taste of the coffee, then be happy with your grinder. If you aren't, or want to get as close to perfection as possible, then consider something else.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there a way to get Caffe d'orzo in North America?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I know it's not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; coffee, but I fell in love with "Caffe d'orzo" on a trip to Italy.  I seems to be ground, roasted barley run through an espresso machine.  The shots don't taste quite like espresso, but grassier, milder, and less oily than coffee (in a way that I sometimes crave).
Can I make it--or something like it--conveniently without living on the Mediterranean?  I think some expensive "pod" (N)espresso makers sell pods for it in Italy.  If I could figure out the roasting myself, I might even invest in a countertop espresso maker, but I don't want to ruin expensive equipemnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there's a safer way to experiment - ubrik, bialetti, etc?  Anyone experimented with this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You should be able to find the roasted barley itself in an international food store, often sold for steeping like tea (a tisane). It is often called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roasted_barley_tea" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;mugicha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Japanese) or other names. When prepared for tea, it is sometimes sold blended with, e.g., green tea, so be sure to check the label. Alternatively, a home-brewing outlet will probably have roasted, malted barley available. This will be even sweeter and maltier still. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon also sells &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0002BKIRW" rel="nofollow"&gt;roasted barley for tea in bags&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure it would be a bit different when brewed like espresso but maybe similar enough and convenient in tea bags. I like the taste of the tea-like infusion, like toasted malt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think your idea to brew in a moka pot is a good one, but you'll have to find a grind that works well: I suspect a grind just a bit coarser than you would normally use for moka would be a good place to start. I don't think you need to be worried about equipment damage, but I haven't tried this (yet!). Next time I can get my hands on some &lt;em&gt;mugicha&lt;/em&gt; I think I shall!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What purpose have those grooves inside the dripper?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm using the V60 dripper from Hario and was curious about the grooves inside the dripper. I think that they are present to slow down the water running through the filter and let the water pass as much as coffee powder as possible, but I'm not really sure. Is this really the intention of this grooves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pkFso.jpg" alt="Dripper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;These grooves are for improving the flow of coffee through the filter. The grooves create space between the filter and the cone to permit little channels for the coffee to flow into the vessel after passing through the filter paper. I think the ridges also help "wick" the coffee away from the filter paper, helping the filter paper drain better.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the ridges are absent (as in Chemex cones, for example) the brewed coffee sometimes wells up between the filter paper and the cone. See also &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1658/262"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1660/262"&gt;my answer that compares the two styles of cones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the shape and location of the grooves, some are spiral-shaped, others are straight, staggered, etc. I don't notice any advantage of any style as long as they're present, and I suspect the shape and location is purely aesthetic or marketing, not significantly different in any functional way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/11/best-ceramic-coffee-dripper-pourover-hario-bonmac-bee-house-kalita-reviews.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this article from Serious Eats&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the grooves additionally help "keep water distributed evenly among the bed of coffee grounds." Presumably this is related to the drainage I mention above, but was a more-legitimate source than my theories above, so I wanted to include.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is this tamper/filter thing that came with my moka pot for?</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xA9qJ.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a base, funnel, top and a little extra bit that seems to just fit inside the funnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it for?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;OK, I've worked this one out. This little thing is called a &lt;strong&gt;reducer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you can do is put the reducer into the funnel. It should sit on the indentation half way down. You then put coffee on top of it. This allows you to make less coffee with a larger pot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, although I haven't tried it yet, it seems that most people complain that the quality of the coffee reduces (!) significantly. Many complain of a weaker brew. It's probably better to use a smaller pot if you regularly want to make less coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see many people to swear on their manual grinder (me too) but I'm curious if there may be some difference. In many coffee shops there is an automatic grinder which puts a kilogram of coffee through in a few seconds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the temperature in mind. Maybe this change the taste of the coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The most important differences I think, are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;temperature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, in all cases, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;time matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;; so, time might be a crucial factor for someone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the rice would not be burnt&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (because that would taste horrible), but roasted instead. Healthwise it is perfectly safe, like the other options mentioned above. Just note that rice has no caffeine, so you wouldn't get the &amp;quot;kick&amp;quot; you get from real coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I get a more even grind with a rotary grinder?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In general, &lt;strong&gt;I prefer burr grinders&lt;/strong&gt; for grinding coffee beans, but sometimes I have to use a rotary grinder. &lt;strong&gt;I'd like to understand how to best use the rotary grinder for grinding coffee beans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find burr grinders generally produce a superior result in terms of &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/84/how-does-coffee-grind-consistency-affect-coffee-taste"&gt;grind consistency&lt;/a&gt;, less heat generated, and therefore final product is better. Sometimes in a pinch, however, I need to use a rotary grinder (e.g., it's the only grinder around; burr grinder hopper is full of other beans; flavoured beans that I don't want to pollute the burr grinder; testing to see if a newly roasted batch of beans is "ready", etc.) -- and there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1812/blade-grinders-any-advantage-over-burr-grinders-besides-cost"&gt;some advantages of rotary grinders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'd like to use the rotary grinder in such a way as &lt;em&gt;to make the ground coffee particle size as even as possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Is this even possible? I find that, no matter how I use the thing, I end up with some very large chunks (even whole beans) and some extremely fine powder. The result is only usable in filter coffee (drip/pour-over), but it simply doesn't "work" as well as when the ground coffee particle size is more even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have searched for techniques or recommendations, but I find exactly &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; helpful on this, but I believe there must be &lt;em&gt;some way&lt;/em&gt; to optimize the use of a rotary grinder. I have tried things like...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pulsing the machine. Turning on for a second, then letting the blades come to rest, then pulsing some more, until I achieve approximately the grind I'm looking for;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaking the grinder up and down during the grinding;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revolving the grinder around in a circle the opposite way that the blades are spinning;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using more or less beans in a single grinding session ("half full" seems to work best for me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these seem to have minimal / marginal benefit. &lt;strong&gt;Is there any way to improve the coffee bean grind consistency using a rotary grinder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;"Using more or less beans in a single grinding session" will yield the most bang for buck, usually.  However, this is highly dependent on your particular rotary grinder.  Rotary grinders are like miniature blenders.  Just like in a full size blender trying to make a milkshake or something, if you over- or under-fill the blender, then the blade won't be able to mix the ingredients as it cuts through them.  Cheap grinders won't be designed to mix very well as they grind, so with terrible grinders, you probably won't see much benefit to your strides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to experiment with your particular blade-style rotary grinder to see how much you can add without prohibiting movement once the beans are fully chopped up, and without leaving too much movement where they just bounce around inside.  Too much room will create friction from the grinder chamber sides, and will start to warm up the coffee oils.  Too little room will result in the same bean being over-ground (too much friction from the blade), and you'll get coffee paste in the inner center of the grinder chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving consistency and repeatability to the level of a fast-food chain will be impossible, as rotary grinders are way to sensitive to how many beans you put in, as well as size and shape of the bean, how hard the bean is (age of bean), lunar phase, etc.  Maybe this is why all the big coffee chains use more expensive burr grinders in-store (not that the coffee is better, which it arguably is, its just more predictable).  Some fancy rotary grinders have timers and knobs and levers to set so you don't have to count to yourself before you let go of the grind-button.  That helps, but is far from a silver bullet.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Avoid clumps in finely ground coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am currently using a Baratza Encore grinder with my Saeco Aroma espresso machine.  I know that neither of these are very high quality products, but I really don't have the budget to upgrade.  The Encore is able to grind sufficiently fine and I have been quite happy with it, however, I get a lot of clumping when grinding for espresso.  It can be difficult to evenly distribute the coffee when you get these clumps, so it would be nice if there was an easy way to avoid this.  Anyone have any suggestions?  I've heard people say that a doser can solve this problem as the rotating sections will break up the clumps.  This is a nice solution, but I don't believe the encore is capable of being upgraded to have a doser.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's not a very high-quality grinder, it does extremely well for the price. The clumping is an artifact of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humidity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heat from grinding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type and roast of the bean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grinders that produce almost no heat while grinding, to the point that they do it reliably enough for it to be a listed feature cost &lt;em&gt;ten times&lt;/em&gt; the amount that you paid for your grinder. Heat during grind isn't an indication of a low-quality grinder, rather, little to no heat is simply an indicator of a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; high-quality grinder. There isn't much you can do about this other than purchase a manual burr grinder and grind by hand &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; gingerly, which takes lots of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tamping alone should be sufficient to deal with any clumps (at approximately 15kg of force) - if it's not, then you want to take a very close look at the beans you're using, and the level of humidity they're exposed to in storage. Is your grinder normally close to anything that produces steam? Is your kitchen air really humid? Are the beans stored in air-tight containers? If you have clumps that tamping won't take care of, you probably have a moisture problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be the bean, some roasts just &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; do well for espresso, no matter how fine the grind or how dry the storage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href="http://www.lavazza.us/us/products/blends/espresso/qualita-oro/"&gt;Lavazza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://shop.illy.com/online/store/product_coffee-all-us_whole-bean-medium-roast_us"&gt;Illy&lt;/a&gt; produce a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; pleasant medium arabica bean that should work very well in your grinder. They are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; consistent in production, delicious, and should give you a good baseline to select other beans that would work similarly well. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get beans that weren't specifically produced with espresso in mind to work, but it takes a bit of tinkering. I recommend the above beans very often to people just getting started because they're delicious and very easy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, try one of those, see what comes out of the grinder. If you're still getting clumps that don't immediately break down when you tamp (tap the portafilter on the sides a few times before you tamp to help this) you could try cleaning the grinder, changing how you store the beans, or looking at a de-humidifier in the area that you keep them. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is soap/water enough to get safely clean coffee mold from my mug?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Typical lazy guy problem - I didn't clean my ceramic cup after using it and haven't used the cup in about 3 weeks. It's been sitting on a shelf in my office. I noticed today it had some little mold bumps at the bottom (must've just been a thin film of coffee left over).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took it down to our kitchen at work and scrubbed it with soap and water and a sponge. Is it safe to drink out of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read around and many say it's safe, many say unsafe. There were many suggestions to just bleach the cup. That seems like bit much to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is soap and water strong enough? I washed 3 times.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I would feel confident drinking out of a ceramic mug after a good scrubbing with soap and water.  Smooth (glazed) ceramic surfaces are more easily cleaned than rough ones, so perhaps the rough ones deserves extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a concern about sanitizing the mug, putting water in the mug and leaving it in the microwave on high until the water boils should kill any mold.  According to &lt;a href="http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/news/2012/important-temperatures-for-food-safety" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this 2012 Penn State Extension bulletin&lt;/a&gt; on important temperatures for food safety:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Processing foods in a boiling water bath will kill most bacteria, molds and yeasts.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Getting large volume lattes</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So, I'm usually a pourover-coffee drinker, and I know a little bit more about that side of the spectrum … but lately (somewhat to my own shame) I've gotten into Starbucks lattes. Like, ‘more than one a day,’ into. I've got an old Nespresso machine from when I first started drinking coffee and espresso, and didn't know which I'd like more (I took both straight at the time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've started trying to make my own lattes at home with the Nespresso, to save money and time, but I have no idea what I'm doing, and I'm having terrible results. Most importantly, I can't figure out how a Starbucks barista is getting &lt;em&gt;twenty ounces&lt;/em&gt; of final product, from two shots of espresso. When I'm using the Nespresso (pull one ‘latte’, pull a second ‘lungo’ into the latte), I get maybe 9oz of coffee-product; and that's &lt;em&gt;stretching&lt;/em&gt; the phrase, as it's basically slightly-coffee-tainted steamed-milk. (It's barely even brown!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help me get from where I am, to having a drinkable 20+oz beverage, &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; having to pull like 6 shots of espresso (and 450mg of caffeine) into my travel mug? /=&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Assuming you are not planning to buy a lot more machinery, you can simply use the Nespresso to make &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;espresso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - depending on your preferred strength, two to three shots should be what you need for your 20 oz mug. A Starbucks “Venti” is named for the twenty oz volume and contains three shots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that's basically a puddle in your mug:&lt;br&gt;
You need to fill the other 16 oz. and you do that with &lt;strong&gt;steamed (foamy) milk&lt;/strong&gt;. If you wanted to do this "correctly", you would use the steam wand of your espresso machine - which the Nespresso doesn't have, I presume.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have an immersion blender, preferably with a disk, heat (not boil!) your milk and whizz it until you get soft foam.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other options are a stovetop or electric milk frother - the manual pump-action ones are available for the price of four to five Starbucks coffees, the electric ones cost a bit more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not buy one of these teeny-tiny hand-held flimsy wire-whisk stirrers, they are a funny gadget but not sturdy enough for daily use and large volumes of milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The milk-to-foam-to-espresso ratio is up to you, find what you like best. I suggest starting somewhere at about two thirds milk / one third foam plus three shots and tweak your drink until you find your preferred recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Portafilter difficult to turn</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Saeco espresso machine. When I place the portafilter into the machine, it is very difficult to turn and lock. Do you have any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As your question is very open I will try to answer two common roots of your problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Too much coffee. Per cup of espresso it should be 7g of ground beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) No "tamping". You probably did not compress the powder in the porta filter (called tamping). This is what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/3154328/285206732/stock-photo-barista-using-a-tamper-to-press-ground-coffee-into-a-portafilter-285206732.jpg" alt="tamping"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe you compressed it when you tried to place it in the machine. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to create green coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;On the weekend, I've visited the vienna coffee festival. I've tasted "green coffee" there. Its taste and look was similar to green tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it a tea, created from the leaves of the coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to search it on google, but I've found "green coffee capsule" advertisements only.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;What I have seen online suggests that it is what one would think of as severely under roasted (by coffee standards) coffee.  The flavor profile is very different than traditionally roasted coffee and much closer to tea with a lot of bitterness from compounds that are generally roasted off.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How long should I stir French press before "pressing"?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What are the pros/cons and effects of stirring, either "too much" or "too short", in a French press?  My rule of thumb for steeping is to let the coffee cool down to a drinkable temperature, then serve immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going with the thinking that in whatever chemical reaction is occurring during the brew, I would want to accelerate it with maximum stirring.  Particularly when maximizing caffeine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press#Preparation" rel="noreferrer"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press#Preparation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;shows a quick stir only, however.  They mention a range of brewing times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(side question:  the only reason &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to stir with a metal spoon is to prevent breaking the beaker?)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience, I can say that stirring does not affect the brewing process in a French press a lot. The initial stirring is just for homogenously distributing the grounds in the water. Then, the rest of brewing happens itself in the water by chemical extraction itself and the main factors are time and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to your question, I can say that you may be over extracting if you are waiting for the water to cool down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One quick recipe and other related discussion are mentioned &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2717/what-is-the-recommended-coffee-bean-to-water-ratio-for-drip-brewing"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Best option is lactose-free milk. I assume you live in India and it may be hard to find in India as lactose intolerance is not common among Indians.

  <title>What are some strategies for handling the transition between different-aged beans in a coffee shop Espresso grinder?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Suppose my grinder's hopper contains beans roasted 14 days ago, and the hopper is almost empty; suppose further that I have a full bag of 5-day-old beans, ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the new beans are added to the hopper on top of the old beans, then there will be an abrupt change to the coffee's "dial in" once the transition between the old and new beans is reached. This is a drawback in the commercial setting; it would be hard to keep track of where the transition is, so some customers could receive improperly dialed espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dial setting will also be affected if I wait until the hopper is completely empty; the grinder will not grind consistently if the hopper is underfull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final option I can think of is throwing away the old coffee beans to make way for the new ones. This seems to be a waste of money. Any tips?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You will just have to find some form of compromise. I think the best way would be to empty the Hopper and then fill it with the new beans (also sometimes you might want to switch up the espresso?). You should figure out how your grinder behaves once it's getting more empty and with this knowledge you can quite easily adjust the extraction such that the quality will not decrease too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most likely case is that the dose will decrease slightly. You could put a scale next to the hopper and if you feel like your espresso is running faster, check if the dose changed because the hopper is getting empty and adjust your grinder accordingly. I think checking the dose and grind occasionally throughout the day is a good way to up your espresso game in any case. It helps me learn a lot about the coffee and setup. There's tons of variables, like humidity and temperature that will change the behavior of the grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How acidic is Liberica compared to Arabica and Robusta?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Today, during a discussion on acidity I realized that I could compare the acidity of the two main species. It's common knowledge that Robusta beans are generally more acidic than Arabica beans. But, what about Liberica?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe a follow up question: could we have a picture of general characteristics of Liberica?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Today I had a coffee tasting of Liberica on various roast levels.
I can say that Liberica is totally different from Arabica and Robusta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arabica generally is bitter with a lack of after taste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robusta is generally strong with and lack of after taste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liberica is less bitter, but full of aftertaste (bitter, coco, sweet and a bit of berry taste)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say Robusta lover may not prefer Liberica, but if you found Arabica and Robusta is too bitter, you may love Liberica wich is full of aftertaste flavours if roasted right. A mid range Liberica is comparable to a high grade Arabica.&lt;br&gt;
An Arabica or Robusta blend with Liberica would complete a full coffee flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberica is rare because it was almost extinct due to coffee rust disease and it is very expensive due to scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Aluminium moka pot put through dishwasher and then polished - would it alter taste?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Common perceptions on Aluminium moka pots:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They need to be kept dry as to prevent aluminium oxidation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people reckon you should just rinse the pot and not clean it completely, in order to minimize aluminium taste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ran into a situation where the cleaner put a Brikka through a dishwasher and then polished it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would it affect the taste?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would it lessen chances of aluminium oxidation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would it affect the metallic taste?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any other thoughts on this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As you suggest and note in your question, and it deserves repeating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aluminum of any kind is generally &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; recommended for the dishwasher: it is likely to corrode / oxidize like your pot did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping your moka pot clean and dry will also help reduce the formation of pocking and oxidation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, while unsightly, &lt;strong&gt;it should not be harmful to use&lt;/strong&gt; after going through the dishwasher. You should &lt;strong&gt;thoroughly wash by hand&lt;/strong&gt; no matter if you polish or not; you should remove any leftover polish, aluminum oxide, dish detergent, or any other residue (also suggested by Ecnerwal in a comment on the question). Polishing is possible with acids or metal polishes, but will probably not provide more than temporary, cosmetic benefit. That is my experience when trying to "restore" accidentally-dishwashered aluminum: I washed it thoroughly, and I continue to use it in its tarnished state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn't find a really good reference about these recommendations; &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/post/aluminum-dishwasher-rematch-919613" rel="noreferrer"&gt;here's a discussion on Chowhound&lt;/a&gt; with some reasonable information; many more by searching "dishwasher aluminum" or similar. Some suggest strong chemicals and abrasive scouring pads; I personally wouldn't use these for fear of further damaging the pot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal pick is to use a stainless steel moka pot, affording a little more margin for error on cleaning. That said, aluminum models heat quickly and certainly do look classic and classy.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This problem seems quite normal. Over time, the little holes are filled up with small coffee grounds and stuck there by the help of gluing force of grease. This grease is extracted during brewing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Heat (self cleaning oven or BBQ)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acetic acid, thus vinegar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citric acid, thus lemon juice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat is the most effective option as it burns out the organic compounds without leaving any residue. Place the filter in the oven or BBQ while doing a cleaning cycle. You’d be amazed  at the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the comparison: &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RRGxj.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Before cleaning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q0E2K.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;After cleaning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the to other options, These acids are food, so they are safe to use. You may leave the filter in these for a while. Apart from that, you may try alcohol, but check whether it damages the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last option may be bleach. It dissolves any organic compound quite easily as it is corrosive. However, &lt;strong&gt;it is not safe&lt;/strong&gt;. You must rinse it thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's going on inside a Nespresso capsule?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, a standard espresso shot is about 40 mL in volume, and a lungo/allongé is 100 mL or more. They start with the same amount of ground coffee, but the lungo is made by putting more water through the grounds. (This is assuming a standard portafilter machine.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So... if I have two Nespresso capsules in front of me, and one says "espresso" and the other says "lungo," shouldn't they have the same amount of coffee inside? Is there an actual difference between them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Update&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two kinds of capsule weigh the same (6g), so it appears that there is no actual difference between them, unless there's something I'm not thinking of...&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Well, as you have yourself conclude that they have no difference regarding the amount of coffee (6 g). I just gonna put there an important note that some people miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espresso capsules are made to be extracted as espressos and lungos, as lungos. The point of this is that Nespresso's lungo coffees are supposedly designed to have a more balanced flavor over a longer extraction/more diluted in contrast to the espresso which was made and evaluated to be drink in a single, stronger shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for myself, I had both ways already and I do believe that at least for the espresso capsules, stick with espresso size (especially if you are using a 3rd party capsule). Nespresso's lungos are often too watery, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does anyone know the history of the “washed process?”</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Where did the washed process originate and how has it developed and progressed?  And what are the different forms and variations it has taken over the years?  I have a hunch that it began in Ethiopia and am hoping to confirm my suspicions. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The washed process in coffee has a rich history that traces back to regions known for their coffee cultivation, such as Ethiopia and Central America. It emerged as a response to the need for cleaner and more consistent flavors in coffee beans. The process involves removing the pulp and mucilage from the coffee cherry before drying, resulting in a focus on the inherent flavors of the bean itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the washed process has developed and progressed through various stages of refinement. Initially, it was a relatively simple method involving pulping the cherries, fermenting them, and then washing away the residue. This helped reduce the risk of defects and inconsistencies in the beans' flavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the coffee industry evolved, so did the washed process. Coffee producers began experimenting with fermentation times, water quality, and drying methods to fine-tune the flavor outcomes. The goal was to bring out unique taste profiles while maintaining the clarity and brightness associated with the washed process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different regions have also adopted variations of the washed process. For instance, in Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee, the process has deep cultural roots. The Ethiopian &amp;quot;washed&amp;quot; method involves fermenting the beans in water, which gives rise to the renowned fruity and floral flavors characteristic of Ethiopian coffees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Central America, where the washed process gained prominence, variations emerged based on local practices and environmental conditions. Some producers focused on extending the fermentation period to enhance complexity, while others employed controlled fermentation tanks for precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As specialty coffee gained momentum, the washed process took on new dimensions. &amp;quot;Honey-processed&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pulped natural&amp;quot; methods emerged, combining elements of both washed and natural processes. These variations aimed to strike a balance between flavor clarity and the fruit-forward qualities associated with natural processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the washed process has evolved from a rudimentary method to a complex and versatile approach in coffee production. Its development has been influenced by the pursuit of consistent flavors, regional traditions, and the desire to showcase the unique attributes of different coffee varieties. This evolution has led to a diverse range of washed process variations that continue to captivate coffee enthusiasts worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What’s the best all purpose zero retention grinder for single dosing?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What is the best grinder that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;is considered all-purpose (grinds coarse enough for cold brew, French press, through to pour overs &amp;amp; Chemex, and fine and consistent enough for espresso using non-pressurized baskets), and;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;has very low or even zero retention to allow single-dosing (eg. 18g beans go in, 18g grounds come out)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve sort of been in a long search for a grinder that fits that criteria. I recently purchased a Rancilio Rocky, and while it is an excellent grinder that grinds a consistent grind-size, this grinder’s design has a chute that gathers up to 2-3g of coffee when single dosing (18g of beans go in, 16g of grounds come out.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My needs are to have a multipurpose grinder that allows a multitude of slower immersion and faster brew methods (including a fine espresso grind for non-pressurized baskets) &amp;amp; doesn’t retain too much per grind cycle, which easily adds another 5-8 mins in my brewing routine just trying to tap and brush the grounds out of the grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help would be most appreciated  &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;a href="https://baratza.com/grinder/sette-270/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Baratza Sette 270&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href="https://www.baratza.com/shop/sette-bg-coarse-cone-burr-holder" rel="noreferrer"&gt;S2 Cone Burr&lt;/a&gt; which is better suited for courser grinds and have been very happy with the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r2J4V.png" alt="Baratza Sette 270][1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like it for its vertical drop of the beans straight through the blades into the cup, rather than having to be shunted to a chute off the side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I find I still have to use the &lt;a href="https://www.home-barista.com/grinders/ross-droplet-technique-eliminating-grinder-static-t24051.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Ross Droplet Technique&lt;/a&gt; and give a few slaps on the lid during the last couple of seconds while it is grinding, when I do that, weighing the coffee before and after shows little or no difference before and after. (Can't say the same for my previous grinders that I had to thump hard to get all the grinds out.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use it happily for aeropress, moka pot and siphons. The reviews mention there's an upper limit of the coarseness the Sette's can produce, but it has been fine for me so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also the &lt;a href="https://baratza.com/grinder/sette-30/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;30&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://baratza.com/grinder/sette-270wi/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;270Wi&lt;/a&gt; models in the Sette range depending on the features you want and your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I judge the quality of 'green' beans?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'll have a chance to visit some coffee farms in the coming months, at which time I'll be able to purchase small amounts of 'green' Arabica beans. The only experience I have with purchasing these types of beans in the past has been online, and I'm not particularly certain that the beans I received could be considered fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a chance to actually see what I'm getting before I get it, what should I look for in a fresh bean as far as quality? Are there characteristics that I can look for which indicate that (if properly roasted) the bean will produce something good? I can only compare with what I've bought previously, which was of dubious quality, so I'm not entirely sure what to look for.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have been purchasing everything from cheap beans to rather pricey beans and what i discovered while buying the more pricey (and higher quality) beans was that the fragrance of the bean is somewhat stronger and can actually smell of more than just the usual grassy fragrance. Notes from fruits and nuts are not unusual and could be a indicator of somewhat higher quality coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no scientific proof of this, and while even expensive coffee can be bad, it is my empirical approach to determine what could be a step up in coffee quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that i have to admit that its hard to determine the quality of the bean before it has been roasted.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I know how hard to tamp my coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;For someone without an expensive machine that can regulate the pressure when tamping, how can I know how hard to tamp, and if I'm tamping &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; hard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make espresso with a counter-top machine, and I tamp with a hand-held tamper like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pXoSf.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I put my whole weight on it, or just a little? Does twisting while I tamp have an effect?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Each new bean becomes a bit of an experiment with each new machine you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rule of thumb is to grind just enough to fill the portafilter so the beveled edge of the tamper becomes flush with the edge of the portafilter using about 15kg of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crude diagram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    ||||||     &amp;lt; Tamper
| [||||||||] | &amp;lt; Tamper 'head' flush with portafilter edge (note, it's flush)
| .......... | &amp;lt; Tamped coffee
| .......... |
+------------+
    /    \     &amp;lt; Goodness pours out here
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how much coffee that is, and just how much over 15kg you need to apply in order to tamp that much coffee to get the right pressure to pull a great shot is a matter of science that you'll need to do. You might want a finer grind instead of more pressure, you have to experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with your usual espresso grind setting, a dose appropriate for the size of the filter you're using and then work from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get grinders that auto tamp for you based on your settings, so when you hit that 'eureka!' moment, you can reproduce it somewhat reliably &lt;em&gt;using the same equipment&lt;/em&gt;. For home use? Just be ready to experiment with the first few filters full when you get beans you haven't tried before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no real 'rule' here, other than you want as much coffee as you can get in the filter with the tamper sinking flush given about 15kg-ish of pressure. It varies wildly from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Cronat Gold is  (at least in my country) 30%-50% cheaper than  Krönung. The taste is also very similar, the Cronat Gold maybe bit more delicate or having less caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the differences between the two, and why such a gap in the price?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Jacobs Cronat Gold is smoother and more mild than Jacobs Krönung Instant coffee.
Krönung is blended with coffee of various regions across the world, Cronat Gold is not. It's the closest to home-brewed coffee (i.e coffee from the European Highlands). 
No idea about the cost difference though.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does pre-heating a puck on the group head produce more crema?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In my never-ending quest to get just a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; more crema out of every shot, I've been experimenting with some advice I received from a barista - allow the puck to warm a bit in the porta filter on the group head prior to pre-infusing and pulling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried this, and I'm still skeptical - I don't really see a difference in the amount of crema that I get. I've tried a few different beans with this experiment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/en/coffee-at-home/coffee-for-espresso" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Illy&lt;/a&gt; - Arabica, medium roast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lavazza.us/us/products/blends/qualita-oro/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lavazza Qualità Oro&lt;/a&gt; - Also Arabica, medium / blonde roast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I do get a tad more pressure, I'm not getting any more crema than I usually do. His logic was pretty simple, pre-warming at around the 90 degrees Celsius that the head / portafilter tend to be results in more of the oils in the extraction, hence crema. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've let it pre-heat for up to a few minutes with no real change in the pulled shot, with and without pre-infusing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this just a tall tale? Am I not letting it get hot enough or for long enough? Is Arabica just too gentle of a bean for this to work? The reason I'm trying to get more crema is for a few new deserts I'd like to make, the coffee is still delicious, I just hoped that the experiment would yield more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brewing using a Breville Barista Express (manual mode), if it makes any difference.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Well, I've heard a lot of "pro tips" and advice having worked around espresso machines for a few years. And I must say, this one is new. I have never heard of warming the coffee itself. I can't imagine that, at the temperature at which the brew head usually resides, many significant changes are made in just a few moments of warming the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest I've heard to this is that some believe in the opposite. A fellow once told me to leave my spent puck in the portafilter if someone was going to be brewing again shortly. He claimed this helped retain heat in the portafilter. Though the science checks out, the results proved marginal and pretty much just made you the lazy guy using the espresso machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in closing, I'd say that the effects of warming your coffee are probably negligible, and that you can get more crema more easily through other means (buying better quality coffee, adjusting your brewing variables, etc)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How should I vary my steaming technique to create the correct ratios of steamed to foamed milk for the drink I wish to create?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When steaming (semi-skimmed) milk with the steam wand on my Espresso Machine I tend to end up with quite an even texture throughout. I always steam the milk until it reaches the 'steam zone' on my thermometer which is between 65 and 70 degrees Celsius. My technique for steaming the milk is to 'skim' the steam nozzle on the top of the milk so as not to create huge bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I only have this one technique for steaming milk, therefore I can't distinguish between say a cappuccino, flat white, or latte - which each require varying amounts of steamed and foamed milk.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You're on the right track for good foam by keeping the tip of the wand close to the surface. To end up with less foam, submerge the tip as the temperature rises and the hiss drops to a whisper; I usually dip down after the first 15 or 20 seconds or so for a latte, longer for a cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you hear milk "screaming" in coffee places, that's the sound of a submerged wand in cold milk. The result is milk that tastes flat and has little or no foam. As long as you keep the wand near the surface until the milk warms up and quiets, you can experiment with time and depth until you're getting the results you want.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there a method to make flavored coffee without syrups?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;As far as I've seen, flavored coffee is created by putting the beans in a tumbler with the desired syrup flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a method to create flavored coffee without using syrups or other sweeteners?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I believe there are several ways to make flavoured coffees without syrup or sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I make vanilla coffee by mixing fresh vanilla seeds with finely ground medium-roast coffee, and seal the mixture for some time (duration depends on the weather). The result is quite nice, with a slight touch of vanilla. This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a product---just for personal use and still exploring. The difference with syrup or essence or flavouring is that the touch feels lighter and more natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic mechanism here is to mix ground coffee with some spice, and let the mixture sleep for flavour to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mechanism is to put some spice directly in a container with roasted beans. This seems more appropriate for spices like cinnamon (no need to extract seeds like for vanilla).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not tried to mix spices with &lt;em&gt;green&lt;/em&gt; beans, as the roasting stage changes a lot of things, but that should be an interesting path.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;More of the oils in the coffee remain as opposed to being filtered out. The coffee sits in the water, nothing is filtered out.

  <body>&lt;p&gt;The peaberry coffee from Tanzania is &lt;a href="http://www.coffeereview.com/the-tanzanian-peaberry-mystery/"&gt;well-known in the US&lt;/a&gt;, though perhaps partly due to marketing forces here, the corresponding flattened beans are not easy to come by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there other varieties/regional coffees that feature a peaberry collection?  I'd be interested in trying some of these, esp. if one can compare the peaberry taste to that of the normal "twin" beans.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;My findings are that it's actually exactly the same.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaberry"&gt;Peaberry beans&lt;/a&gt; occur in almost all coffee in some percentage.  They aren't grown separate, they are the exact same coffee that's been sorted out of the processed beans so that the lot looks more homogeneous and sells better.  I've actually been lucky enough to at one time have peaberry, oversized and "regular" beans all from the same lot.  The coffees all tasted exactly the same to me.  I have a friend that claimed he tasted some difference in in the larger beans, owing perhaps to not having been roasted as thoroughly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beans I had were Sumatran Toba Batak, sold in sorted lots of 17+, peaberry and regular.  I am sure that almost any processing station you went to in the world could do such processing if they chose, although it's probably labor intensive and would add some cost to the beans.  If Tanzania is doing it regularly, they have probably found it's financially worth it.  On occasion when I look closely at the beans I am roasting, I'll usually find a few peaberries in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How many plants are needed to brew a cup of coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am curious. How many coffee plants do I need to harvest for beans in order to brew myself one cup of coffee (7g of ground, processed beans).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is less than one, then how many cups of coffee can I theoretically brew from one plant?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It all boils down to three questions:
1) Yield = How much did you get from the grounds?
2) Strength = How much ended up in the cup?
3) Ratio = What did you get there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yield: Yield pertains to how much soluble you took from the coffee grounds. Ground coffee has something between 27-30% of its mass being soluble, that is, stuff you can dissolve in water. If you kept boiling and boiling coffee grounds in water, eventually you’d get everything that the grounds have to give. Above 22-24%, however, and you’ve essentially reached too far or squeezed too hard, because unpleasant flavors will emerge. Below 18%, and you’re not getting enough out of the coffee, at worst, leaving the coffee with underdeveloped flavors or simply wasting coffee. So it sort of answers the question, “How much did you get from the grounds?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strength: Pertains to how much of the final brew is coffee, and how much is water. SCAA Golden Cup says 1.15-1.35% brew strength is a desirable zone to the most number of people, though we espresso-lovers tend to like a bit more… something like 1.3-1.5% brew strength. Over 1.5, up to 2.0% or more, and you’re in the “heavy, thick” coffee zone. Simply put,“How much ended up in the cup?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ratio: Simply, grams per liter. It provides one of the major answers to the question that Yield and Strength might ask, that is, “How did you get there?” Perhaps the most easy-to-remember ratio is 60g/L, or 60 grams of coffee for every one liter of water. The fact that you can make a balanced, pleasing, delicious cup of coffee at 60 g/L should give any barista pause when they’re finding that they’re using 80 grams or more per liter when they’re making coffee. Is it “wrong” to make coffee at 90 g/L? No… but is the additional 50% of coffee yielding an additional 50% of coffee quality, compared to the barista down the street making superb coffee at 60 g/L?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the assistance of common men like me,
&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rjtoe.gif" alt="YEAHAHAHA!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, to clarify the actual number, if Arabica then 1 - 1.5 pounds per cycle and if Robusta 2 - 2.75 pounds. And then you can calculate the rest. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How and when is flavoured coffee flavoured?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When you buy whole flavoured coffee beans, how have they been flavoured, and when in the process does this happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, are the beans soaked, sprinkled; does it happen before or after roasting; etc.?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.coffeeflavoroils.com/How_to_Flavor_Coffee_Beans.htm"&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt; seems to suggest that the best time is just after the beans are roasted and still warm and "open", which makes some sense.  However, it does state that many flavorers cold flavor the beans and simply add more flavoring oils to make up for the reduced absorption.  I can't think of anyone that would flavor the beans before roasting.  Not only would the high heat of the roasting risk degrading the taste of the flavoring oils, it would also affect the roasting process and flavor the roasting equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for distribution, I believe most of the flavoring agents are fairly potent and the process is a sprinkling or pouring then mixing, and not a soaking.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a manual espresso machine. I have to turn the pump on and off with a switch and judge when to stop by myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I judge when the best point is to stop pulling the shot? Do I do it by volume, colour, or something else?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I generally judge when to stop my shot based off when blonding begins to occur. This is when the espresso changes to a noticeably lighter, yellowish color. At this stage, only bitter flavors are being extracted from the coffee, and any more extraction will only degrade the flavor of your shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes a bit of practice to notice blonding, and can be made more obvious by using a bottomless portafilter. I also suggest using a stopwatch to determine how long it takes before blonding occurs, so you can see how consistent the rest of your process is. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Are the last drips after pulling an espresso less tasty?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Someone told me that the last drips coming out of a espresso machine after the pull is finished (when there is no water pressure any more) contain bad flavors. He recommended that I remove the coffee cup in the moment the machine stops producing pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that true? If yes, why?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's not really the pressure, that's just timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends on the beans and roast; your comparison point is the first few (after pre-infusion) drips that came out. The last ones are always going to be weaker and quite possibly more acidic because the puck is both drained and saturated at the same time. It's drained of oils and flavors, and saturated with hot water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you can actually &lt;em&gt;detect&lt;/em&gt; that difference should it be added to the rest of the shot is a matter of uncertainty, hinging on your sense of taste and the type of coffee used. If it's a dark-roasted robusta blend then you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to detect a slight almost 'metallic' or slightly salty flavor, but you'd need an extremely acute sense of taste. The water you use also has a lot to do with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can sometimes be easy to get caught up in what is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; happening, even if you (or most) can't really taste it. If you get more satisfaction out of your coffee because you've managed to improve the taste &lt;em&gt;even just a tiny bit&lt;/em&gt; - then great, and keep doing it, because that's what it's all about. Just be critical and test for yourself, with your setup, and your beans :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can I use an espresso blend with an aeropress?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've heard that for a quality cup of aeropress coffee, one should be only using single origin coffees. I was wondering what the advantage of using single origin coffees was over espresso blends when brewing with an aeropress.    &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The answer is quite simply: It's up to your personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of things make a good cup of espresso; some people like (or think they like) single origin expensive marketing-buzzword-infused coffees, and others have found other roasts / blends that work just as well for them. You can use whatever you want in your aeropress to make a cup of joe that suits you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/45007/what-are-the-recommended-coffee-roast-types-for-aeropress"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; on Seasoned Advise suggests, there are some objective measures we might look at. Since and Aeropress (disclaimer, I don't have one, but I have used them while backpacking quite a lot) tends to extract a lot of flavor, a medium roast will probably prevent your coffee from being too dark, and still provide a lot of flavor. You'll also want a nice fine grind, which is generally what you want for any espresso machine.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is essential for a proper tamp?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There are competing theories as to what you should do when tamping grounds in a portafilter. Some of these include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 lbs. of pressure, 90* angle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knocking the side of the portafilter with the tamper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rotating the tamper while pressing down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The North, South, East, West &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even the ground distribution with your finger prior to tamping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only ones I see and hear consistently as required is the use of 30 lbs. of pressure and a 90* angle. The rest are variously employed and are not authoritative or dogma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; for  a proper tamp?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/5/how-important-is-tamping-coffee-for-an-espresso-machine"&gt;How important is tamping coffee for an espresso machine?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are a pantload of recommendations on tamping, but the one recommendation common to all is... &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;practice!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; And... The most optimal way of &lt;strong&gt;tamping depends on every individual pull&lt;/strong&gt;: the beans (freshness and grind), your skill, machine, etc. at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the goal (and most important part, in my belief) is to &lt;strong&gt;pack the grounds uniformly.&lt;/strong&gt; Any non-uniformity in your puck will allow water to flow more through certain areas than others, giving you non-uniform extraction across your grounds (some over- and some under-extracted). For example, if your tamper isn't level, you'll end up with a "slanted" puck; if your grounds are packed &lt;em&gt;more loosely&lt;/em&gt; in some places than others... these can yield un-even pucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, here's a few other common recommendations, some of which you mentioned in the question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the grounds uniformly and smooth before tamping. This gives you an even bed of grounds so you can tamp evenly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15 kg / 30 lb. of pressure. A bath scale could help until one gets this "by feel".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a heavy tamper. This helps you control all of the other parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim for sinking the tamp approximately as far as the bevel (a general rule).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twisting is not necessary (some do at the end of the compression for "polishing", but not necessary).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there's some controversial bits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Knocking" is something I totally don't understand. The idea is to tap the portafilter so as to somehow redistribute the grounds after tamping. I feel like it would just mess up a good puck, but some recommend it either to ensure uniformity of compression of the bottom and top of the puck, or to get grounds off of the side of the portafilter. More discussion at link [4].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the "North, South, West, East" topic: this illustrates tamping at four points around the portafilter. Since the tamp is &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; smaller than the portafilter, the theory is that tamping at points around the sides helps to prevent grounds from creeping up around the tamp (up the side of the portafilter). It seems to me that an appropriate sized tamp will alleviate most of this, but it seems like a reasonable recommendation. Some guides (e.g., below) recommend this, others don't. More at [1].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  <title>Are coffee 'vaults' like Friis really effective?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Some days ago I stumbled upon with this coffee jar: &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001V9VDP0"&gt;Friis coffee vault&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are products like this, with an special valve, really useful to preserve the freshness of ground or whole bean coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;So there are a fair few, well, questionable claims on that page, and some downright contradictions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One Year of Friis Freshness Valves included, to vent freshness damaging CO2 gases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CO2 gasses are not 'freshness damaging'. CO2 is, to all intents and purposes, inert in this context. The only gas you really care about when freshness is concerned is Oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a well-designed valve shouldn't wear out. It's not like a filter that gets clogged over time, it's just a mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Air-Tight Storage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air-tight with a valve? It's either air-tight, or it has a valve...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this product &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, is a well sealed and opaque container. It will likely perform no differently from any other well sealed and opaque container.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Do I need higher pressure to create a ristretto?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I want to make a ristretto. Besides grinding my coffee finer, do I need to increase the pressure of the steam, or should I leave it the same?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Typically, a ristretto is an espresso shot pulled with half as much water. If you assume a normal shot is 30ml, the only practical difference in pulling a ristretto is to stop the extraction at 15ml. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffee grind, quantity and pull pressure should remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, if you feel as if the shot is taking too long, or coming out too fast, you could try adjusting the grind before adjusting the pressure, which should be trickier.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does my coffee pot need to be fixed?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So, I have this GREAT cocoa coffee. It is literally the best coffee I have ever tasted. I know, big statement. Anyways, I recently moved out and had to buy a new coffee pot. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, my coffee consumption went from 100 to 0 real quick because of the taste I've been getting with this new coffee pot. I've tried tap water and bottled water and it doesn't change anything. It just tastes like.... well it tastes like crap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions on how to fix it? I'd love to drink coffee every morning again without having to pay $2 for a large cup of Biggby's coffee. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also, if someone could create a new tag called coffee-pot that'd be fantastic and useful :-) )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's just a cheap $25 5-cup Mr.Coffee as well! &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you could be more specific with your question it would be easier to answer.  For example was your previous "pot" a percolator or automatic coffee maker or what?  By the same token, what is your current set up?  By a process of elimination you should be able to isolate the factor that's causing your coffee to taste sh***ty.  Basically those are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The coffee itself - is it from the same source, being stored the same, same age, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same water - you said you'd tried different water sources.  Bottled water should yield good coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The method of brewing, which would include water temperature, coarseness of grind, how long it extracts (steeps), cleanliness of the equipment, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all the factors except the method of brewing are accounted for, then the problem is in the brewing method, which would include the coffee maker.  If you know it's clean and it still tastes bad, you need a different brewing method.  Depending on how much coffee you drink, there are lots of options that will yield good coffee.  I have found that the simpler methods (i.e., French press, AeroPress, pour over) are the easiest to control and therefore give you the best chance of getting a good result.  They are also cheaper and easier to keep clean.  Brewing good coffee is actually pretty straightforward so don't give up!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Whats the purpose of preheating a coffee roaster?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I own a Gene Cafe and was wondering why many across the internet recommend that the roaster is preheated before the roasting takes place, in comparison to the manufacture which claims that one should just add the beans and start the roasting straight away while everything is cold.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Preheating your Gene Cafe lets you choose between life cycle of the roaster and roasting consistency.  By preheating your roaster, you should be able to get more consistent roast times.  In my case my garage is sometimes 50F and sometimes 80F, so a preheat cycle would certainly probably help.  I don't do it though.  Any machine has a finite number of cycles, and you are shorting that window by preheating your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I roast one and a half pounds a week (a half pound for work, and one pound for home).  The half pound is always done by itself from a cold start.  When I do the pound for home, I do two half pound batches, the first is from a cold start and the second is done immediately following on a "preheated" machine.  I try to aim for the same roast level on each of the batches and the second one consistently needs less time to reach the same level.  I generally set a timer and come back 14 minutes after the start.  This allows me to fine tune the last portion of the batch, on cold batches I generally add a bit of time, and on the preheated ones I end up subtracting a bit (to get the same roast).  I am fine with this as it saves me a cycle and will prolong the life of my roaster.  However, I can see that some folks would want the roast length of two such batches to be much closer to the same at the cost of that extra cycle.  For them it may make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How are coffee beans differentiated?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Tea grown in Sri Lanka is classified by elevation into high, mid and low grown tea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High: rich in flavor &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mid: blend of flavor and aroma &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low: rich aroma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does coffee has such differentiation? If so what are they?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It is important to have in mind that altitude is not the only feature that allows one to differentiate the coffee beans. Temperature is perhaps even more important (altitude influences in the temperatures suffered by a coffee plant, but not all the same altitudes mean the same temperature profiles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a brief summary (taken from &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;), we can say that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower elevations (Robusta species) mean a more intensely coffee flavoured bean (more caffeine).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher elevations (Arabica species) mean more acid and complex taste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the main factor is the species of coffee. The elevation and temperature only tell you what of the varieties of these species you can successfully grow and how you can harvest it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this source &lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.scribblerscoffee.com/flavor_effect_of_altitude" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Effect of Altitude on Coffee Flavor&lt;/a&gt;, that relates only to the Arabica species, can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Altitude contributes to a coffee taste profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideal growing conditions for the coffee tree:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the coffee belt (a band extending approximately 30° north and south of equator).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At high elevations, between 3,000 feet (914.4 meters) and 6,000 feet (1828,8 meters) and beyond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These conditions provide a frost-free climate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Averaging 60°F (15.56°C) to 70°F (21.11°C) year round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooler mountains provide a slower growth cycle for coffee tree.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means deeper and more interesting flavours (due to a longer maturation process).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better drainage of soils means less water in the fruit.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further concentration of flavours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More fertile the soil, the better.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A volcanic soil is often preferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The farther we are from the coffee belt, the less elevation we must grow coffee tree in order to avoid low temperatures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a more specific summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally speaking, more elevation implies a more pronounced and distinctive flavour profile:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the simple, mild and subtle of those grown at 2,000 feet (609,6 meters).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To a fruit, spice, floral profile for those grown at 5,000 feet (1524 meters) or above (when possible).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  <title>Make my coffee stronger without equipment</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just had an espresso at a café, and it really put into perspective how weak my everyday coffee is. All the equipment I own is a blade grinder, and my method is a turkish brew (grind the beans, put them in the cup, pour-over some boiling water, wait for it to sink, done!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can I do to get stronger coffee?&lt;/strong&gt; And more precisely, what will make the &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I am not willing to buy any new equipment or machines; I'm asking about what I can do with what I've got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: tried adding grounds onto boiling water, instead of pouring water over grounds. Here's how it went:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; No success, strength did not increase and taste just got worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I did:&lt;/strong&gt; 
I took my strongest beans, ground them as fine as possible, used two identical cups, divided the grounds into two equal portions (on a separate tray). I put grounds first, boiling water afterwards in the first cup, and did the same thing but backwards on the second one. I did not stir any of the cups after adding all ingredients. After quite some time I tasted both cups, I am now finishing them both up while programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observations:&lt;/strong&gt;
The grounds on the "water-first" cup took a considerable time to sink into the liquid. Even after the brewing time had passed, much more grounds were floating around there than in the "pour-over" cup. Also, the water-first cup had almost no foam, which the pour-over cup had plenty of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;
The water-first cup was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; stronger than the pour-over; if anything it tasted weaker. The taste was quite different too, water-first tasted a bit stale/watery (not much but there was a clear difference). Pour-over had a rounder and more full aroma, liked that one more. And the crema/foam &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; a lot better on the pour-over as well.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I see only one possibility to make your turkish brew stronger and that is using more coffee beans per serving. You are using boiling water and long extraction time so almost everything from the coffee gets extracted leaving you this only option to make it stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Lighter roasts are going to have more of these flavors but it obviously depends on the bean as well. If all you are going to change is the method of brewing the coffee, I would recommend making sure you don't use too hot of a water temperature and trying to use a pour over. I find pour over allows for more delicate flavors you are describing, rather than something like aeropress which can approach more espresso type coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Moka Pot Buildup</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was given an old moka pot (this one in particular is a Junior Express pot) and noticed this buildup in the water well - it seems to be a little different from the typical scale buildup that I googled (it's grainy, thick, and hard). It has a metallic odor to it that seems to affect the flavor of my coffee. Is this just normal scaling, or something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that people feel really strongly about not cleaning these things, but I think I may have to in this case since it's affecting the flavor of the coffee. If you do think I have to clean it, what would you recommend for clearing this buildup out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, this was after I brewed a cup this morning, so it looks darker than it did before. The buildup had some white in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, how often/how do I know when I should replace the rubber gasket? I have no idea how old this thing is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for your help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GYglD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Due to the fact that the spots are picking up the colour of the coffee, it sounds to me like they may be scales from minerals in the water being used. This is normal occurrence for almost every type of coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When NOT to clean your Moka pot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In daily use, do not use soap and water to clean the pot. This is because oils from the coffee will build up in the pot and contribute to the flavour of the coffee for each concurrent use. Just rinse with warm water, let it dry, and put it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When to clean your Moka pot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't use your Moka pot daily, these oils will build up but become rancid over time. If you don't use your pot daily, it's a good idea to give it a scrub with soap and water every now and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When to DESCALE your Moka pot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems that your Moka pot may have some hard mineral deposits, called scaling, inside the pot.&lt;/strong&gt; There are multiple ways to descale a coffee machine. You can use a vinegar solution, lemon juice solution, or you can even buy coffee descaler from some supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recipe for lemon juice and vinegar solutions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50 warm water, 50 percent vinegar. (Do not inhale any fumes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25 percent lemon juice, 75 percent warm water. (Safer and more pleasant)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice: Don't boil these solutions as the fumes can cause damage to your eyes and respiratory tract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When to consider throwing out your Moka pot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your flavour is still affected after you descale it, you may be dealing with some rust. If you happen to notice any rust inside or your coffee just has a strange taste after some amount of time and many brews, you may need to consider getting a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck. If you have any questions, feel free to post them or comment here.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is preparing instant coffee a brew?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Preparing instant coffee is basically pouring hot water on dry coarse powder made out of a coffee drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it still called brewing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like a language shortcut, as the brew happened before making the instant coffee powder.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'd agree with you.  There isn't a brew happening because the solution was already created.  What you are performing is a rehydration.  However, "let me rehydrate some coffee" is a pretty awkward turn off phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Cheese and Coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;On friday nights I like to get some treats for my wife, it usually amounts to cheese and coffee.  But these are fairly different flavors.  I know there are lots of wine and cheese combos, but are there any cheese and coffee combo's that particularly complement one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any dunkable cheeses?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I've never heard of cheese and coffee pairings, but I've had coffee that has very wine like qualities. Personally this sounds like it would amount to gut rot, however if you try some lighter roasts or preferably profile roasted beans from areas in Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, they tend to have very wine like qualities. Single origin, profile roasted beans typically have very renounced flavors, and profile roasting typically roasts the bean lighter preserving the tannicy, floral, and somewhat wine like qualities in the bean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be prefered to eat the cheese with a cold coffee. If you cold brew coffee it tends to bring out the wine like qualities more so than hot brewing. A common method for this is often called "dutch coffee", where cold/iced water slowly drips over grounds into a vessel over a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as dunking the cheese in the coffee. I'm not so sure about this. I mean there are a lot of cheese out there. As far as anything salty with coffee, I generally think the tastes conflict. Personally I don't dunk anything in my coffee, and when it comes to wine &amp;amp; cheese tasting you don't dunk the cheese in the wine. Perhaps a light cheese that isn't salty would work well dipped in coffee. I'm thinking somewhere along the lines of a soft cheese, but a soft cheese itself wouldn't be easily dunked into coffee. You could try spreading Mascarpone on a biscotti and dipping that. Even a porous cheese is unlikely to absorb and carry the taste of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheese and coffee aren't exactly a pair made in heaven, but I can see it working much like you said, like wine and cheese. However dunking the cheese in the coffee gives me a bad taste in my mouth. Like I said there are some soft cheeses(usually those used in desserts) that I could imagine being dunked in coffee in some manner, but this is more like a dessert with coffee, which makes me think of a traditional italian 4 course meal which usually ends with the "dolce" or dessert which is often accompanied by espresso. Italy typically also uses soft cheeses in their desserts. Tiramisu, which is very well known, is actually a combination of cheese and coffee. However, like I stated the food and the coffee typically remain separate, unless the coffee is an ingredient in the food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what you're trying to do is interesting, but I'd avoid making your wife a test subject. I'd recommend keeping the coffee and cheese separate. However, they can absolutely be consumed in the same sitting, but I don't imagine the actual tastes meld together well in the same mouthful. If she wants something to dip in her coffee, biscotti is a common choice, and if she wants cheese, try spreading some mascarpone on it. You can have fun with different biscotti variants and fold things like chocolate, fruits, etc into the mascarpone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come from the renowned cheese state Wisconsin, and I've been a long time coffee enthusiast. This title definitely struck interest.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Low wattage K-cup type office machine</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In my office setting we are limited to 800 watts power draw.  We have a team of 10 people that use the k-cup machine and had to switch to a k130 which is awful for multiple users.  Are there any other k-cup brewers out there made for low wattage with a large water tank?  Is it possible to alter a 1400 watt keurig to draw less power (heat slower)?  &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Well, I don't know anything about keurig, but as the question has gone unanswered so far, I'll give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my experience with electronics, there are 3 ways how a low power mod could be done, depending on the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is to mod the power supply to the boiler (e.g. put an inductor in series) and hope the machine's software can cope with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second: If you do have to modify the software (and are able to; replacing the controller and reimplementing the software may be required) you could implement a pwm regulation of the heating (your power line got to survive short overloads of ~0.1s)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third: The boiler has a too small heat capacity for a full cup and needs to draw full power during the pouring of coffe (my machine does this when it has to make a large cup). You have to change the boiler (bigger one might be too big for the case), and then continue with one of the steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If this can't be done in the fashion of “the nerd in the next cubicle does it for free coffe and no one is ever to talk about the mod” but you have to employ an external firm and need to match safety regulations, you are almost definitely cheaper off by upgrading the power supply to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee brewed without filter taste less bitter and sour?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So my roommate and I have been a bit intrigued by brewed coffee after watching tokyo ghoul (lol)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got some BonCafe grounds(southeast asia brand) at a supermarket and brewed it with a filter. Have to get sugar and milk inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He bought some whole beans (looks medium roasted) and grinded it and also drip brewed it. Even more bitter than the seemingly darker BonCafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in Aeropress with a AbleBrew disk fine metal filter it taste even more bitter and sour than the drip brewed variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I got an idea from turkish coffee where you directly mix coffee grind with water without filtering. (well there is further boiling involved in turkish coffee but whatever)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after pouring in water and mixing it with coffee groind with a spoon for like 10 seconds, and letting the ground set, it tasted (to me and him) surprisingly better than drip brewing and aeropressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to me there is coffee taste inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I got some old (2014 September) lavazza qualita oro ground coffee, tried aeropress and direct mixing, same thing happened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is that the “what you are supposed to get from coffee” taste quote the connoisseurs? Or is it underextraction or something? But why isn't I seeing any recommendation on this brewing method? Am I doing anything wrong with the aeropress and drip brewed ones? (to me they taste both sour and bitter) &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm not exactly sure if this is accurate, but I think it has to do with flavor extraction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you brew with a filter, the water is going to fall through the grounds too fast to actually develop good flavor. Sure, you'll get coffee, but you're only giving the water enough time to take the more bitter tastes with it. I have this same problem with my coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you brew directly into water, all of the water is in contact with all of the grounds for a considerably longer amount of time. The water will extract the bitter tastes AND the more flavorful aspects of the grounds, which is why you thought this tasted better. It wasn't just bitter, it was bitter and flavorful, and that's coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're not doing anything wrong with the filtered methods, it's simply a matter of opinion among coffee tasters. Some people enjoy the convenience of fast, filtered, and bitter coffee because it's what they know as coffee. The reason the Turkish method isn't suggested is because, the way you describe it, it sounds like the grounds stay inside the coffee, and many people loathe having to deal with that--even though it produces much better coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So no, you're not doing anything wrong; however, the reason you're finding flavor differences is that the extraction of flavors is far different between the two methods!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>French Press: Fine Grind!</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have tons of fine ground coffee, and the only way I make coffee is in the French Press. However, I have read that you should never use fine ground coffee in a French press. But there must be a formula out there that works with fine ground. The problem is, I always seem to put too little or too much fine ground coffee in. I just can't seem to find a good formula! Could someone please provide a good formula for making fine ground coffee in a French press?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A fine grind, especially an espresso grind, are usually avoided when doing immersion brewing methods. Reason being that their extraction times are so low that is usually not practical to press a fine grind coffee. Though this isn't a &lt;em&gt;direct&lt;/em&gt; answer to your question, I'd recommend grinding your coffee directly before brewing. This is best practice, and it means you can grind your coffee to whichever coarseness that you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to french press this coffee I think it would be best to adjust your extraction time. If you're using an espresso grind I'd do a short bloom, then extract for 45seconds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To eliminate fine grit, wrap a paper coffee filter over the strainer, and press immediately to achieve 45second extraction, as there will be more resistance with the added filter. If the coffee is sour or bland increase extraction time. If the coffee tastes too bitter, then try decreasing the extraction time. Bloom for maybe 8 seconds. It's hard to tell, most people press coffee because they like pressed coffee, and they'll usually use a coarse grind for this. Using a fine grind will likely negate the benefits of using a press pot, and could very well be impossible/very difficult to consistently get a good cup.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does espresso taste different to percolator coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently switched from percolator coffee to espresso. The taste is noticeably better. I feel as if it is common knowledge that espresso coffee is superior to percolator coffee. Why is it different? What are the scientific reasons for this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Espresso tastes different than percolator coffee, but not necessarily better.  Espresso extraction produces a more concentrated drink with a different set of compounds that you would get with percolator extraction.  With a shorter extraction time and higher pressure, espresso will have a slightly different set of compounds than you would get from the same coffee with percolation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people prefer a more concentrated taste, however, some do not (many people think espresso is "too strong" when drank straight, thus the popularity here in the US of mixed espresso drinks).  This doesn't mean it's necessarily better.  Some types of beans are not well suited to espresso extraction and will actually produce a better cup when brewed with other methods.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All coffee can be benefited or hindered by brew/prep method, but the quality of the bean and it's roast have quite a bit of influence in the matter.  Badly grown, processed and roasted coffee will not magically be made better by espresso extraction.  It might actually end up worse because concentrating it can highlight it's flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As another dimension, I see a few trends that you might wish to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green beans.&lt;/strong&gt; More people are getting into home roasting, and green (processed but un-roasted) beans are the vehicle. Also, green beans store better for longer time (e.g., freezing) so you can capture a particularly good "year" or crop of beans for a longer period of time. Even whole, unprocessed cherries might be an interesting notion. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skins and pulp.&lt;/strong&gt; People make beverages out of the (usually discarded) fruit skin and pulp, called &lt;em&gt;cascara&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;qishr&lt;/em&gt;, or other names. These are difficult to find dried, and perhaps impossible to find fresh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct marketing.&lt;/strong&gt; Another trend is (broadly) the "farm-to-table" strategy, where roasters or cafes will purchase beans directly from farmers. There might be good business in brokering "direct" deals like this, by helping responsible farmers with good beans get good prices by selling directly to the end user (e.g., a local roaster) instead of through an aggregator or warehouse. You could seek out some exceptional beans with unique qualities and get those farmers into the specialty direct trade market. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a perspective from a "consumer" standpoint. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Best filter to use for cold brew?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What's the best filter material to use for DIY set up for cold brew coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I used a pour over funnel with a standard paper filter it seems to get clogged up faster than when hot brewing.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I find the very same problem with cold brew taking a long time. Though we have a few Q/A about this in the &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/cold-brew" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;cold-brew&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;cold-brew&lt;/a&gt; already, I think could stand on its own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I use a "two-phase" method&lt;/strong&gt;: using &lt;strong&gt;first a "primary" or "coarse" filter&lt;/strong&gt;, like a French press plunger as described &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/423/262"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere, or a metal mesh tea or coffee filter as described &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/432/262"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or even a sock or cloth as suggested &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/2017/262"&gt;by this question&lt;/a&gt;. This strains through quickly, but only filters the larger particles that would very quickly clog a paper filter. &lt;strong&gt;Second, I put it through a paper filter&lt;/strong&gt; (I find Hario-style filters drain faster than Melitta-style filters). I find this works the best of any setup I have used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For completeness, we have a few Q/A about this already. See for example &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/431/262"&gt;making cold-brew easier&lt;/a&gt; for some more ideas about "pre-filtering"; see &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/400/262"&gt;starting out and equipment&lt;/a&gt; for some other tips; and even try &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/2073/262"&gt;cold brewing with AeroPress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Brewing 900 Cups of Coffee (In 24 Hours)?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm helping organize a big 24-hour event and as a big coffee drinker, I got put in charge of the coffee. We are expecting 300 people to each drink 3 cups of coffee over the whole event so up to 900 cups of coffee in 24 hours!! Since this is outside the realm of what I normally do at home with a french press so I thought I better check that I'm not making any horrible mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our big concerns is that this event will likely have quite a few somewhat-discerning coffee drinkers. We also need to be able to brew coffee in the middle of the night when any local coffee shop has closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I remember helping out with a percolator at a big event and that seems like the best approach this time. I've seen it done more recently and after some research it seems like the common approach. I also found a local rental location that will rent us a few for our event that each have a capacity of 100 cups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a better approach? If a percolator is the right approach, what beans/grounds will produce the best flavor? How many lbs/kgs of coffee will likely be needed?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Your problem depends more on the shape of the data than the raw quantities. 900 cups in 24 hours is one cup every 40 seconds or so, which isn't so bad, however I doubt that's the distribution of actual orders!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to assume all of your 300 guests want to have a cup of coffee during a one-hour period. This works out as 5 coffees a minute, or one every 12 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm ignoring factors of manpower, cost etc., and focussing on coffee preparation only :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get 12-cup french press pots very easily, and probably larger ones. Assuming each one takes ~6 minutes to cycle (prepare, brew for 4 mins, serve, rinse), meaning you can serve 2 people a minute with one pot. 3 pots would allow you to serve 6 people a minute (amortised) and serve 300 people in an hour. A few more pots would make it very comfortable. Assuming you're grinding the coffee fresh, you'll get a far superior brew from this than perk coffee that's been sitting there for 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So serving people fast enough shouldn't be too hard, but boiling water fast enough might be, and for that you just need an &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IgVDG.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;urn&lt;/a&gt;, with which you can keep a large enough supply of boiling water to just fill up and go.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;What type of coffee would you good people recommend as a quick and easy caffeine dose for staying alert? (specifically this, although I am fond of the taste too as a secondary factor!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently just drinking some pretty meh instant coffee every morning, two generous spoonfuls keeps me alert but it's a chore and it's not very appealing. I've never had some of the more exotic stuff like espressos, are they financially viable or advisable for someone who isn't a coffee connoisseur?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Many factors are at play here. 
I assume we are talking about morning coffee and not about something that helps to pull you through the night of studying.
So, the easiest (minimal amount of work in the morning) would be a drip coffee.  Definitely an upgrade from instant.  Many of machines allow you to preset the wake up time, so that you prepare everything at night, and then you wake in the morning to a ready cup (or two) of coffee waiting for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you actually care about taste and want something that won't just give you a kick in the head, but actually be a pleasurable experience - buy real whole bean coffee, and grind it yourself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to a way to make coffee - that is a purely opinion based question. Some people love espresso. I like my french press.  Some love their morning cappuccino, etc.  You have to experiment and find your drink of choice. 
But the first best thing you can do, is to buy a whole bean coffee and grind it yourself.  The taste difference (specially after an instant coffee) will be enormous!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Luck in your coffee adventure! &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How bad is coffee for your teeth?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I occasionally hear people saying that coffee has bad implications for the health of teeth. Are there any significant dental studies proving/disproving this statement?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in &lt;em&gt;Letters in Applied Microbiology&lt;/em&gt; suggests that coffee can break down bacterial plaques that form on teeth. These studies were done in a lab on extracted teeth, using moderate amounts of coffee on lab-grown plaques formed by bacteria from saliva. Antibacterial effect of coffee: calcium concentration in a culture containing teeth/biofilm exposed to Coffea Canephora aqueous extract,
&lt;em&gt;Letters in Applied Microbiology,&lt;/em&gt; Volume 59, Issue 3, September 2014, Pages: 342–347, N. Meckelburg &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee can stain teeth. Is that a health issue? It's often listed with other dental health issues but I'm not sure why. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acidity of coffee may wear down teeth over time, but it's not a prime suspect. The acidity of coffee generally falls somewhere between that of pure water and cow's milk, according to one &lt;a href="http://www.highergroundstrading.com/blog/38/coffee-acidity:-the-science-and-the-experience--"&gt;article.&lt;/a&gt; Fruit juice and soft drinks are far more acidic (pH &amp;lt; 3). Coffee is only slightly more acidic than saliva. There is no shortage of articles claiming high acidity of coffee but 
a pH of 5--a plausible average--is not very high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are probably hundreds of studies in English alone on the effect of coffee on dental health. In terms of acidity it's not as bad as juice and not as benign as water. The plaque-preventive effect is something new to consider. There is also a 2012 study by the American Cancer Society suggesting that coffee lowers the risk of oral cancer. Those who drank 4+ cups of coffee a day were about half as likely to die of oral/pharyngeal cancer as those who drank occasionally or not at all. Coffee, Tea, and Fatal Oral/Pharyngeal Cancer in a Large Prospective U.S. Cohort, &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology,&lt;/em&gt; Dec. 2012 (online), Hildebrand et al. To the extent that oral cancer is a dental health issue this is also something to weigh.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science doesn't necessarily furnish a simple answer. It appears that the mildly corrosive effect of coffee may be offset by a tendency to reduce plaque. If coffee helps reduce the risk of oral cancer one could argue that, overall, the benefits of coffee for dental health outweigh the risks. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why do some grounds float and others sink when brewing by pour over</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When brewing by the pour over method (in my case with a Chemex) I've noticed that some ground beans will float when I fill the filter with hot water, and other beans will not float. It's consistent with specific roasts, so I will use two roasts for illustration (leaving out the roaster for now to avoid any prejudices).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roast A&lt;/em&gt; will always float when pouring hot water over, throughout the entire brewing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roast B&lt;/em&gt; will always sink, especially towards the end of brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I leave the grounds and water undisturbed until all of the water has gone through the filter, &lt;em&gt;roast A&lt;/em&gt;'s filter will be coated with the grounds while most of the grounds in &lt;em&gt;roast B&lt;/em&gt;'s filter will be flat on the bottom (as you'd expect). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also of note, &lt;em&gt;roast A&lt;/em&gt; has a much more intense &lt;em&gt;bloom&lt;/em&gt; after an initial pour of roughly 20g of water into 20g of grounds. It looks like a freshly baked brownie, whereas &lt;em&gt;roast B&lt;/em&gt;'s bloom is much less intense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, what does this say about the beans for them to act one way or the other? My first thought was maybe it had to do with freshness of the roasted bean, but A and B could have the same roast date (less than a week old) and still act as described. Or maybe it's not freshness of the roast but freshness of the bean prior to being roasted? I'm not qualified to hypothesize the chemical reasons for behavior, but hopefully someone here is.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Bean density varies dramatically with roast level.  The more roasted a bean is, the less dense it becomes.  My guess would be that less dense beans would have more of a tendency to float and more dense beans would have a tendency to sink.  However, I imagine that there are other factors as well.  Grind size would affect the mass vs surface size of the grounds and have some say as well.  Age could also be a factor since freshly roasted beans still contain/give off some amount of gas.  That degassing time can also vary with roast level and bean variety, so just time since roast may not always be a consistent measure.  Overall I'd guess there are four plus factors affecting the "float" of your grounds.  And that's not to even say anything about the content of the water itself. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Should I change my coffee drinking habits when using braces?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm getting braces tomorrow and this is a life or death situation: can I still have coffee with braces??! I drink it hot and cold and I would also like how it would affect me if I did drink it (hot and cold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee should be fine&lt;/strong&gt; (unless you've heard otherwise from your dentist or other health care people of course!). There should be no additional concern about coffee, e.g., its acidity or temperature (other than normal caution). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some foods to avoid, but I don't see coffee or anything similar on any list of foods to avoid; here's a few curated lists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dentalassociates.com/braces-orthodontics/preventing-orthodontics-problems/foods-avoid-braces/"&gt;Dental Associates&lt;/a&gt;, a practice in Wisconsin, US&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oralb.com/embraceit/what-you-can-eat-with-braces"&gt;Oral B&lt;/a&gt;, a manufacturer of dental products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the recommendations are to avoid hard foods (e.g., crusty bread, ice cubes, popcorn) or sticky foods (e.g., gum, hard candy, caramels), and to be careful of sweets in general (which can promote tooth decay in general but can be more difficult to clean-out with braces.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, take less sugar with your coffee! Otherwise, continue to enjoy your coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What temperature to froth hemp milk to?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When frothing cow's milk, if you exceed 150 degrees, you can scald the milk which makes it taste like eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a similar upper temperature for hemp milk?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I would follow the same guidelines as cow milk when using any alternative milk. For one you really just can't taste a liquid that is scalding hot, so you might as well not go so toasty. Other than that - If you think it tastes great, then keep doing that. If it smells less sweet, it probably is less sweet - you just gotta find that perfect sensory sweet spot. I generally aim for about 135F if it's a drink being consumed on site - otherwise about 145 togo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Are there health risks to eating coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I like to eat coffee beans without grinding or brewing them. I just chew it raw, as it is. Is this activity unhealthy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm talking about the brown, roasted coffee beans.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;No.  Not any substantial ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several listed questions around the topic of eating coffee beans.  Ingesting roasted coffee beans without grinding/brewing them in some manner is quite common.  Many companies sell them specifically to be consumed this way.  Probably the main associated health risk would be caffeine overdose.  However, it's roughly the same as simply drinking far too much coffee.  The main difference being that since coffee (brewed) takes up so much more volume, you are likely to become physically uncomfortable from it before you could get to dangerous levels.  With coffee beans you could likely get to dangerous levels much easier since it would be possible to eat many more beans before experiencing the same "fullness" effect. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does eating a cookie created using coffee beans has the same effect as drinking coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There are some cookie recipes using coffee beans. I've never tried any of them. But I am curious, if eating a cookie has the same effect as drinking coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is all of the caffeine lost during the baking?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;No, because there is no fluid in the cookie.  Eating a coffee cookie will have the same effect as eating a roasted coffee bean.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtually no caffeine will be lost during baking, unless you bake hot enough to burn the cookies.  Caffeine's melting point is 460F (237 °C).  That is well above what your cookie will reach internally while in the oven.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to fix burr contact/alignment issues on an OE LIDO hand grinder on fine grinds?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The burrs on my Orphan Espresso LIDO E hand grinder touch/contact and grind each other when dialing into a fine grind, even when the basket is empty of beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this supposed to happen? Are they misaligned? The burrs only contact on one side - particularly only at one section of the handle turn, and I can't get a finer grind because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;For the LIDO grinders, burr drag, grinding, or touching is likely due to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;misalignment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Misalignment is more likely an &lt;em&gt;assembly&lt;/em&gt; issue than a manufacturing issue since the burrs are machined. This means you can fix your Orphan Espresso LIDO on your own, with some handiwork and know-how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I received my Lido E, the burrs would contact each other at anything tighter than +3.5 on the adjustment ring. After careful realignment, I got down to -5 from "factory-zero" before any contact, fixing a misalignment of over eight notches! -5 is now my new "recalibrated zero".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My burrs are now much better centered than when it arrived, and I can get them extremely close together while keeping them fully free spinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npVWLJnBcAs" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Orphan Espresso's LIDO Maintenance Video&lt;/a&gt; is a detailed guide on how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble your LIDO. He only goes as far as to &lt;em&gt;approximately&lt;/em&gt; realign the burrs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGO_Onbx0NI" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Orphan Espresso's LIDO Grider Burr Alignment Video&lt;/a&gt;, he focuses on burr alignment, going more in-depth. The video is very informative, but I believe alignment can be improved further with these additional steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Perfectly Align LIDO 2, LIDO 3, or LIDO E Burrs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do as he instructs in the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGO_Onbx0NI" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the alignment video&lt;/a&gt; until 7:24

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He will:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tighten one adjustment screw while grinder is upside down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn the grinder right side up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully tighten all screws in opposing X-order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, I suggest:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep grinder upside down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightly &amp;amp; evenly tighten all adjustment screws in opposing X-order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hopper should be lightly secured, locking in the outer burr's alignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn the LIDO right side up and loosen the adjustment ring until the burrs spin freely when the locking ring is locked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly tighten the adjustment ring (and re-lock) bit by bit, turning the handle a full circle and testing for burr contact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the first burr contact occurs, note the clock position of contact (e.g. 3 o'clock)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly tighten an alignment screw at either the same or the opposing clock position (e.g. either 3 or 9 o'clock) until burr spins freely again.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will take some experimentation to figure out which screw to tighten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, you may need to slightly loosen a screw to free the burr.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If all alignment screws are as snug as possible without introducing more burr contact, you're done. Otherwise, go back to step 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If done correctly, the burrs will be so well-centered that when tightening the adjustment ring until first burr contact, the burr contacts in two or more (or all) places at once. The point of first burr contact is your new "recalibrated zero".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What this is doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alignment video shows how to align the inner burr and outer burr before screwing in the alignment screws. The problem is that I found the burrs can still get misaligned during tightening of the alignment screws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My procedure addresses those last 1-2 turns of the alignment screws, between "lightly" and "fully" tightened. Slowly tightening whilst rechecking alignment makes sure that everything stays aligned even as the screws are fully tightened.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Difference between inverted and normal aeropress?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Can someone tell me the difference between a coffee made using the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; aeropress technique and an &amp;quot;inverted&amp;quot; technique?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The differences are minor, but there are differences.  When brewing normally, water begins to drip through the paper filter immediately when poured over the grounds.  After stirring I usually have to add more water after the bloom recedes.  Inverted, all the water stays with the grounds until you flip it over and start extracting.  The extra water added with the normal process is hotter, and I believe will tend to over extract bitter notes more easily, not only because of the higher temperature, but by virtue of the added volume of water passing through the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inverted, however, the volume of water is less, and because of that, the temperature of that water will be lowered a bit.  You can extract quickly, or wait as long as you want to extract the coffee.  Additionally, I have seen it claimed that with the inverted method, oils that will rise to the top of the column will be forced through the filter first and flavor the coffee more than with the regular method where they tend to get trapped in the grounds.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have gone back and forth but always seem to go back to the inverted method. It provides more control of the variables and for me gives a better flavor, even when using the same beans, same roast, same water temperature.  Your mileage may vary of course.   &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to reduce sourness in my moka-pot brew?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;so most things I read say the common problem with a moka pot is a bitter, over-extracted brew, so I'm confused as to why I'm getting the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the beans I'm using- &lt;a href="http://www.coffeehunter.com/green_coffees/archive/costa_rica/finca_de_alejo_castro" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://www.coffeehunter.com/green_coffees/archive/costa_rica/finca_de_alejo_castro&lt;/a&gt;, so the decription implies some acidic/fermented tones, but my brew seems to be coming out quite unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My moka pot is a Bialetti 1-cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beans freshly ground with hand grinder (fine grind, comparison with google image results for 'moka pot grind' seem pretty close).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot water in the chamber (up to bottom of valve).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowest heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting a pretty fast flow, and no oily bubbles at the beginning of the process. Probably 5-10 seconds between start and end of the flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very sour coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried adjusting my grind, and even when the grind is fine enough to produce quite a bit of sediment, there's no noticeable change in flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;What I immediately notice is that you say the entire brew process takes only 5-10 seconds. Even for a 1-pot moka, this seems &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vary some other parameters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with cold water in the bottom chamber.&lt;/strong&gt; While not the best way to brew with Moka in general, it might slow down the brewing process. You should want your moka brew to take closer to 30-60 seconds (my preference, for example). Longer time will allow the sourness to be offset by bitterness (compounds which are extracted after water has been in contact with grounds for a longer time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try brewing the coffee as pour-over.&lt;/strong&gt; This will give you a more neutral preparation that will allow you to determine if the &lt;em&gt;coffee itself&lt;/em&gt; is of good quality and too your liking.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://sheetalsb.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/coffee-drinks-illustrated.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also some details &lt;a href="https://prima-coffee.com/learn/article/steaming-milk" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, however it does not describe the important split in foam and steamed milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For a 3-ounce macchiato, use a 2:1 ratio of espresso to milk; for a
  6-ounce cappuccino, 1:2; and for an 8-or-more-ounce latte, 1:3+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the second art of your question, a cappuccino with more or less milk would not be a cappuccino by definition. However would it taste better, that's down to your personal taste and how much you like foam. Personally for me, it would become more a desert ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much does the flavor of coffee change based on the shape of the drinking &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;According to my "Lavazza Barista Guide" the shape of the cup affects the foam of the espresso and indirectly affects the taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is explained as; the foam helps to protect the valuable ingredients to not to be evaporated easily. Also, the foam keeps you espresso warm while you are not drinking it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the guide, it is stated that the thickness and the vertical angle of the lavazza cups are specially designed for best coffee experience. So that, at each sip you drink some of the coffee and a bit of the foam and the remaining part of the coffee and foam fits to the now norrower part of the cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a bit advertisement and a bit reality in a manual prepared by a commercial company. Quite expected in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What was the cause for the current overwhelming popularity in the brighter, more acidic coffees?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Almost every coffee shop I go to serves up quite acidic and bright coffees. It seems that this is where modern coffee is and is not necessarily a bizarre phenomenon in itself but in particular the world of espresso it has veered quite far away from the traditional Italian style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact it seems we've veered so far towards acidity and people have actually called the Italian style of espresso as 'over-roasted' which I believe to be untrue. I do enjoy a somewhat more acidic coffee when I am searching for a fruitier cup but I do not understand the current stigma against even the slightest darker roast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what caused this tip in the scales that prompted the surge in popularity in brighter and more acidic coffees and seeing even the slightest darker roast as being over-roasted?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think there are a number of factors influencing the current situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rise of micro/small and home roasters.  This allows people access to fresher coffee.  The acidic and bright notes in coffees tend to fade quicker than roast notes.  Meaning these bright notes are more readily available to the consumer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes in coffee processing.  Different process methods favor different flavor profiles.  Dry Process (the oldest) favors less bright and more bodied flavors.  Newer processing methods enhance bright flavor profiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rise and market dominance of large chain roasters.  These companies tend to roast dark because it is easier to hit a consistent flavor profile which lasts longer (important for shipping), but it sacrifices the origin flavors which are varied greatly and available.  They have given dark roasts a more McDonald's character among consumers (consistent, but not high quality). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that dark roasts are bad.  But they have partially been given a bad rep by large chains who are using them to maximize profit, and not flavor.  Home and microroasters now also have unprecedented access to a HUGE variety of beans that years back would have been out of reach.  This means that companies can cheaply distribute very high quality beans with extraordinary flavor profiles when roasted at a lighter level.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why do aeropress columns get abrasions, or scars, near the top?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;A friend and I both have aeropresses that have been through 2-4 years of use. I noticed that mine has what looks like coffee-stained abrasions near the top of the column, furthest away from the filter. This is usually the region where the water surface is at longest, before I end up pressing it. No amount of washing seemed to get rid of the abrasions so they must be baked in to the plastic now. My friend confirmed he had a similar experience with his. Due to the rugged surface, it probably increases the chance of upward-leaks while pressing down on the plunger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this due to some reaction occurring (unlikely I would think), or is it due to heat rising to the top (also seems somewhat unlikely to me)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: Photos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dIbs0.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dIbs0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;However I cannot understood the scars definitely, I would like to offer a solution to the scars I thought:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a possibility that coffee grounds may stick to the rubber ring and scratch the plastic column when pressure is applied as they stay in between the rubber ring and the plastic column. Still, these scratches do not affect the performance of the gadget if they are not large enough to leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easiest way to clean the grounds is rubbing the surface of the rubber ring by your finger under warm water for a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; After I see the photos, my guess is, these scars are caused by the scratches first, then the polished surface of the plastic is peeled off by heat. I assume you may continue to use it without problems. For other people with brand new aeropress, my previous advice still holds: try to wash away residual grounds off the rubber ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a &lt;em&gt;"safety limit"&lt;/em&gt; to the amount of coffee one can drink?&lt;br /&gt;
What are the negative consequences to ones health as a direct consequence of consuming high amounts of caffeine?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Let's look at this from the worst case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose"&gt;LD50&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is around 150-200mg/kg body weight for a healthy adult or 10g&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The caffeine content of a "cup of coffee" (however you define it) varies with beans, roast and preparation method, but according to Wikipedia, (50-)75-100 cups of drip coffee get you in the lethal ballpark. (More caffeine math on this site.) This is an amount of fluid that you can't ingest without other severe complications, but &lt;strong&gt;deaths by pure caffeine&lt;/strong&gt;, e.g. in tablets can happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't kill yourself, the next serious outcome is &lt;strong&gt;caffeine intoxication&lt;/strong&gt;, caused by single doses of about half the LD50 or 400-500mg:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The symptoms of caffeine intoxication are comparable to the symptoms of overdoses of other stimulants: they may include restlessness, fidgeting, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, irregular or rapid heart beat, and psychomotor agitation.[95] In cases of much larger overdoses, mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, or psychosis may occur, and rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked.[99][100]&lt;br&gt;
  (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Overdose"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything else is a question of your metabolism and caffeine tolerance vs. desired and undesirable effects. For example: coffee is a stimulant that counters fatigue and drowsiness - and thus can keep you awake if it's not metabolized when you want to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no general "safety threshold", but if you look at the recommendation of both the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Congress_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynecologists"&gt;American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Agency"&gt;UK Food Standards Agency&lt;/a&gt; for pregnant women, the 200mg caffeine per day deemed safe for them&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; should be more than safe for every other healthy adult. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Sources vary between 5-30g, but LD50 rates for humans aren't exactly a field of much experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Pregnant women show a decreased caffeine metabolism (up to 15 hours vs. 3-4 hours in non-pregnant women) and there is a large safety margin to protect the unborn child.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What Factors Influence Crema Production In Espresso?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I need more crema on top of my espresso. &lt;strong&gt;What are the main factors behind producing crema when making espresso?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I hereby copy a very nice statement from the conclusion of Illy &amp;amp; Navarini's &lt;a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11483-011-9220-5" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;survey paper&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the data reported in the present review may suggest that espresso brewing can be described as “a quick way to transfer carbon dioxide from roasted and ground coffee to a small cup by means of hot water under pressure”. This then leads to the facts that for espresso coffee, carbon dioxide has to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;generated by roasting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;maintained in the bean by proper packaging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;maintained in the ground coffee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;solubilized in water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;released into the beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this framework statements such as “any error in grinding or in percolation, in temperature or extraction level, has an immediate effect on denounced by the color, the texture and the persistence of the foam” or “the foam is the signature of a well-prepared espresso” can be well justified. In fact, foam volume, persistence, and consistence are the consequences of the carbon dioxide content originally present in the coffee. In addition to the importance of carbon dioxide in espresso coffee foam, we believe that carbon dioxide can play a role even from a taste point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore; you need to find fresh nice Arabica beans, roast properly, degas for the correct amount of time, grind them well, brew appropriately with decent water right after grinding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Please see &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2494/what-is-the-difference-between-the-terms-percolation-and-brewing-in-english"&gt;this discussion&lt;/a&gt; for the use of the &lt;strong&gt;percolation&lt;/strong&gt; in scientific papers. It simply means &lt;strong&gt;brew&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there a way to economically store freshly roasted coffee under vacuum?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I know that freshly roasted coffee needs to rest at least a few days before drinking because carbon dioxide is being released from the freshly roasted beans.  At the same time, excess exposure to oxygen will cause coffee to go stale quickly.  Commercial roasters have packaging machinery that sucks the air out of the bag and puts coffee beans under vacuum for storage.  The packages usually have a small vent hole to release carbon dioxide without allowing outside air into the bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is if there is a way to duplicate that storage idea without spending a lot of money on commercial packaging equipment?  I would like to be able to store my freshly roasted coffee without fear of it going stale too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is a way to store freshly roasted coffee - or even store bought roasted beans - at home under vacuum without expensive equipment.  I drink wine and have collected a couple of wine storage devices over the years that I no longer use.  One of these is a bottle stopper with a one-way valve in the top and a vacuum pump for removing the air from a partially consumed bottle of wine.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My idea was to clean out the bottle and fill it with freshly roasted coffee beans, then use the vacuum pump and stopper to apply suction to the bottle to encourage the carbon dioxide to exit the beans without worrying about oxygen making the beans go stale prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found that the beans emit enough carbon dioxide gas to require re-pumping the bottle for the first day or two, but after that it will hold a vacuum indefinitely.  I've added erasable labels to the bottle to record the type of roasted beans I have inside.  Two standard wine bottles will hold about 610 grams of roasted beans, or about 700 grams of unroasted beans, which is 7 batches in my SR 500 roaster.  These are Ethiopian, YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is only mildly addictive and only shows minor physical dependence. It does not threaten physical, social or economic health the way truly addictive drugs will.
"Withdrawal" or skipping your morning cup might give you a mild headache.

  <title>What sort of sugar to add to coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I like to add a bit of sugar to my coffee. Does it matter what sort of sugar I use?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will the type of sugar make any difference to the taste? Does it depend on the type of coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White sugar or brown sugar? Demerara sugar seems to be a popular option for coffee. Or some sort of raw or unrefined sugar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the crystal size make a difference?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes, it makes a difference to the taste. As for what to pick - what you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite is "Vermont Coffee" - ie, use maple syrup (or sugar, but syrup is more cost-effective, at least near a production area where the cost is not much shipping.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends in the UK introduced me to Demerara, which is a not-quite fully refined sugar with a delicate carmel taste. Some of the "raw sugar" products sold in the USA approximate this, and some better than others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times I use USA brown sugar, which is basically white sugar sprayed with molasses, and not nearly as delicately flavored as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plain old white sugar is what it is, and if that's what you want, that's fine too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly have no difficulty distinguishing all of these from each other, in coffee - your taste buds/nose may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grain size affects only speed and ease of dissolving. Particularly in summer I tend to keep a bottle of &lt;strong&gt;2 sugar:1 water simple syrup&lt;/strong&gt; in the fridge for easily mixed, pre-dissolved sugar (not just for coffee.)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How are caffeine pills made?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I tried googling but nothing on the manufacturing, only dosage FAQs etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is: how are caffeine pills made, are they produced using synthesized caffeine, how much of a chemistry is involved, is caffeine extracted during decaf process used?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is a wrong SE community please guide me to right one where I'm most likely to get an answer (preferably with links).&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is almost always created as a byproduct of the decaffeination process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It IS possible to synthesize caffeine. The most popular lab synthesis (1,3-dimethylurea and ethyl 2-cyanoacetate) requires multiple steps, and generally more steps means more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there is a huge demand for decaffeinated coffee. The bonus is exactly as you expected; these processes generate both decaf coffee and caffeine as a by-product, that can then be repackaged or sold in other products.
Historically, decaffeination was done with organic solvent extraction (chloroform and dichloromethane being really common), but today is is usually done with the swiss water process (I suspect this is what ends up in pills and added caffeine consumer goods) or supercritical fluid extraction (which is more energy intensive, but can lead to a higher quality product that is often purchased by laboratories and scientific researchers who use it as part of their experiments).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there a universal label for the sustainability impact of a specific coffee product?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am interested in the environmental impact of coffee and am therefore wondering whether a system exists for labeling the environmental impact of coffee. So not so much brands, such as Fairtrade, but rather if it is possible for the consumer to get information about how sustainable the plantation associated with the specific coffee product (beans, grounds or powder) is, and if there is a scale to measure it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There is no universal label though there are various labels for coffee sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't really have an universal label as each of the labels have their own standards which have to be met and various coffee farms and producers follow certain ones. For example, in the &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-hostetler/sustainable-coffee-certifications_b_1446658.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;, it mentions some of these labels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;USADA (or simply USDA): This is basically the United States' label for organic for various products (i.e meat and fruits) that is not limited to only coffee. It is quite strict (has certification agencies, checks for criterion not only during production but also distribution and packaging) as it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Aims to promote and enhance natural soil activity and cycling of resources, which helps to create a rich and fertile substrate for the crop and maintain ecological balance by prohibiting use of artificially produced (synthetic) agrochemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned by @avacado1, there is an European equivalent to the USDA, which is the EU Organic Program (note that the EU doesn't cover all of Europe). &lt;a href="http://www.usda-eu.org/trade-with-the-eu/trade-agreements/us-eu-organic-arrangement/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some companies like Starbucks have their own labels that guarantee their standards for their coffee:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;C.A.F.E. (which stands for Coffee and Farmer Equity) evaluates the economic, social, and environmental aspects of coffee production in order to ensure that Starbucks’s sources of coffee are sustainably grown. Starbucks collaborated with Scientific Certification Systems (SCS), a third-party evaluation and certification firm, to develop the guidelines for the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rainforest Alliance Program: This is a more "natural" certification since:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With this program, coffee is grown on farms where forests, rivers, soils, and wildlife are conserved and workers are treated with respect, paid decent wages, have proper and safe equipment, and are given access to education and medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bird Friendly Conversation: This label ensures that the coffee farms support the native and migratory birds that come over for a visit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center (SMBC) gives this certification to farmers in order to promote shade-grown organic coffee plantations that can play a key role in the conservation of our global environment and of migratory birds that find sanctuary in these forest-like plantations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as you can see here, the various labels not only have various standards and goals but have their own area jurisdiction as well, each trying to gain support based on what they are.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What variables cause the Gesha/Geisha coffee varietal to be priced so highly?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Being probably the highest priced coffee bean varietal out there currently, it makes me wonder what exactly causes the Gesha/Geisha varietal to be so expensive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it the delicate nature of the plant causing it to yield only in the most specific of climates? Is it due to its availability as a lesser grown type? Is it simply due to it's quality?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Geisha is so pricey because of a lot of marketing true. However it is extremely difficult to grow.
On a farm is Costa Rica this past June the farmer was having a difficult time with his because the root system is not as robust as other Arabicas.
Another reason for the price is that the yields per bush are lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a good article on it: &lt;a href="http://www.perfectdailygrind.com/2015/12/geisha-coffee-according-to-a-4th-generation-panama-producer/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Geisha Coffee According to a 4th Generation Panama Producer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there a difference in taste between bleached, unbleached and natural fibre filters?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is there a quantifiable difference to the taste or coffee brewed with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000N4W2SG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_3C4yyb7ZYPD4E" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;bleached&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0000CF3HB/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_sC4yybV2CXYGP" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;unbleached&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01FYNDM1Q/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_uD4yybK6PF3M6" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;natural fibre&lt;/a&gt; filters? Or would you use one over the other for ecological or economical reasons?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would assume this would be the same to some degree across all filter brewing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This could depend on the brand of filters and the brewing method so it's worthwhile (and fun) to &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/3148/2908"&gt;do the experiment&lt;/a&gt;. I'd love to see results from more experimenters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bamboo vs. Paper Filters:&lt;/strong&gt;
I did this experiment. We only had three tasters but the results were statistically significant at the 5% standard -- all three of us could taste the difference. The bamboo filter made sharper coffee (analogous to sharp cheese) while the paper filter made smoother coffee. We did not all have the same preference between those two batches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filtering out Diterpenes:&lt;/strong&gt;
According to the AeroPress FAQ question &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.aerobie.com/aeropress/faqs/#ui-id-69" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;DO YOU RECOMMEND USING A METAL FILTER IN THE AEROPRESS?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were originally planning to include a metal filter with each AeroPress but when we conducted blind taste tests comparing paper filtered AeroPress brewed coffee with metal filtered AeroPress brewed coffee, the paper filtered coffee always won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also learned using a paper filter is healthier because it removes diterpenes from coffee and diterpenes are potent agents that raise your bad cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q.&lt;/strong&gt; Does anyone know if bamboo filters similarly remove the diterpenes from coffee? Are bamboo filters made from a combination of paper and bamboo fibers?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to make cold brew concentrate?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy the smooth taste produced by my Mizodashi cold brew jug, but prefer hot coffee.  Although I can dilute the cold brew with hot water, it gives me a pretty weak coffee (although great tasting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the basic question is how can I create a concentrate with the smooth taste of cold brew that I can take into work and make my own coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Like @Shiri said in comments above (and hopes that I'm not answer-sniping), most recipes for &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/cold-brew" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;cold-brew&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;cold-brew&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; concentrates. Within reason, try brewing with a smaller amount of water! Compare guides like &lt;a href="https://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/how-make-cold-brew-coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kicking Horse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/filtron" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Stumptown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/cold-brew" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience (except for the &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/431"&gt;problems that I've had with filtering&lt;/a&gt;) brewing a lower volume of water generates very similar results when diluted. Said the other way, brewing with a higher ratio of coffee :: water, then diluting, is my preferred way of brewing, storing, and consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, do store in a neutral vessel that is easy to clean (my preference is a wide-mouth glass jar). Stored in the fridge, it will last several days (maybe a week) and still taste okay. In a plastic jug (or so) it might 1- start to obtain bad tastes from the container, and 2- infect the jug with stale coffee taste over time. Coffee oils (etc.) can be hard to remove especially when cold.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It is true, that Kopi Luwak is one of the most expensive coffee bean. The process to achieve specialised coffee is long and they are risks of failing is very high. Thus, it makes it more expensive. Read ref below to understand more. There are some beans that are produced in Penang,Malayasia are very expensive but they taste out world(honestly). When enquired about it they say because it is freshly farmed and brewed. I believe that because around that cafe, it was all coffee and other farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Grinder is a Breville Dose Control Pro, also new.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shots are pulling in about 26-28 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espresso has good crema that stands up for longer than 1 minute and has rich orange / red tones.  Shot is lively, but not sour with no hint of bitterness, and good heavy body.  This isn't a fruit bomb blend or anything, I am more looking for something that a typical coffee shop customer would find palatable.  Espresso stands up to milk very well.  Personally, I almost feel like the roast may be slightly too dark since with milk, I start getting a hint of roasty-ness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shop Setup (Sour Shots)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18g grounds, pulling 36g output (supposedly this is 2 fl oz also, can't verify as I haven't seen markings on the glass they are pulling into.  If anything, I would say it is probably a 2.5-3oz pull)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine is A Nuevo Simonelli Aurelia 2.  Boiler pressure 1.4 bar, pump pressure 9.5 to 10 later in the pull. Water is not filtered to my knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grinder is a used Mazzer, unknown burr wear (personally I'm thinking this is a likely culprit?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shots are timed for a 27-30 second pull.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shots pull extremely bright / sour, crema tends to be closer to a dirty brown color.  This shot might blend with milk and be drinkable, but just barely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confusing points for me that may bear some explaination...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer pull (and thus probably a finer grind) results in sour coffee, not bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher boiler pressure = higher water temp which tends to scorch if too high and impart more bitter qualities, yet this is sour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is his 2 fl oz of extract such lower weight than my 2 fl oz.  Crema production is heavy on both machines, but the weight difference almost seems to indicate that the crema on his machine is double or more than what my machine is producing which isn't the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Troubleshooting espresso via web forum is pretty difficult but I would appreciate any thoughts on how I might go about getting good shots out of this shop machine.  Oh, btw, it wasn't me pulling the shots at the shop, so tamp could definitely be different between the two shots, but given that the pull times are pretty close together, and I did watch the tamp, I can say that technique is at the very minimum similar.  I can say that both tamps appear to at least be even on a naked portafilter.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I don't think anyone can really give a definitive answer to this but I'd like to chime in to try to help. It's almost impossible to find your answer because of how many different variables are at play here. You should first focus on minimising the variance in your methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You describe the shop shot as being a 'longer pull' and thereby expecting more bitter results. The problem with that assumption is that you can only truly compare shot times if you have extracted the same output weight in both cases. Since you have not, you have not only extracted much less in your shop shot, but, like you noted, it also took longer. I normally only ever measure my shots by weight because that's the number that tells me how much water got through and thereby how much real contact and subsequent extraction occurred.&lt;br&gt;
I use time as a secondary reference to diagnose other problems in my shot. If I suddenly start extracting a same weight shot in half the time that I normally do, I know something is definitely off. Since your shop shot extracted much less output weight, the sourness is clearly due to some level of underextraction from being stopped too early (relative to your home shot). In any case, I always try to aim for 30g in 30s, which means you probably need to grind slightly finer in the shop to be able to extract more and try to hit the same balance as your home shot.&lt;br&gt;
You mention your water sources being different. This is huge! You will never find the same shot if you are using filtered at home and unfiltered at the shop depending on how hard the water is when unfiltered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare shot times as a secondary to consistent output weight and see how grinding finer in the shop would fare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher boiler pressure does not necessarily point directly towards higher temperatures. Also, higher pressures could impact the puck suddenly when the valve is opened which could crack and cause channeling and therefore underextraction and sourness. Your main issues here are still in point 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight difference is purely by choice. Crema production is mostly dependent on freshness of beans and less to do with specifics in extraction method. If preset weight quantities are being used as part of a single button-press on a machine, then your problem starts there. You need to weigh every shot and choose when to stop the shot yourself. Without this control, you're simply relinquishing responsibility of the shot and you are at the mercy of the machine, yet another variable to consider in being able to find the right shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, you MUST minimise variables. Make sure your grind sizes are the same at both locations, ensure your input and output weight are identical, analyse differences in taste and extraction time at same output weight, ensure your sources of water are identical, make sure your tamp pressures are the same. At this point the only real differences will be the machines and then you can start investigating how each machine is affecting the shots. Try to use bottomless portafilters in order to diagnose whether your distribution of your coffee bed was poor and whether channeling occurs during extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combine all of the parameters above with the taste of your output shots and you'll know the next steps you need to take in finding the problem in your shot.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it safe to give decaf coffee to a child?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I heard from a friend that there's a new trend happening. People are bringing their kids to Starbucks and buying them a so-called &amp;quot;baby-cino&amp;quot;, i.e. decaf coffee with lots of cream and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this really an occurrence? Is there any evidence about the effects of coffee (even decaf) on children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there possibly any health risks one should look into before giving coffee to a child?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You may find similar discussion mostly on the &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/health" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;health&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; tag.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me add my opinion here: my 2.5 years old niece drinks regular (not decaf) Turkish coffee together with us during her daily routine. Caffeine's effects are similar in adults or in children. And they are more or less the same. However, children have smaller and more sensitive bodies. So, we let her drink really small amounts. She becomes happy to be a part of the family. I can say, everybody in our family grown up like that for generations, none of us experienced caffeine-related problems. (Still, we are not MDs and we are a very limited sample set. This is a coffee board, not a medical opinion body.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other related questions may arise, but relevant to adults:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As children are more sensitive, every little effect must be considered seriously. Still, &lt;strong&gt;I believe&lt;/strong&gt;, if observed carefully, it should be safe to drink a bit coffee for a child.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How quickly does ground coffee get stale?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="http://www.brewed-coffee.com/coffee/the-4ms-of-espresso/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt; I found this claim:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Great baristas in fact will only grind beans for an espresso right
  before using them. 30 seconds after they have been ground, the beans
  are already too stale for a good espresso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am deeply skeptical. Is there any way to verify, quantify, or otherwise substantiate that claim, or is it superstition?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I can say, by experience, that it's not a superstition. Maybe not seconds, but for sure it's just a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone could find a reference to an experiment or I may encounter and add it later. But, you can easily observe it by your nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aromatic components are the source of the flavor in coffee beans. When you ground them, you crack them fine. The components get free and start to evaporate. That's why you can smell them. However, we want to taste them so badly. So, we need to trap then into the water as quick as possible, before most of them evaporate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a nice chart that shows how quickly coffee goes stale when it's stored as whole beans. Ground coffee, I assume, would be similar, but so much quicker as the surface area is greater for evaporation this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off/166#166"&gt;When does coffee go off?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's the big deal about pour-over coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;For the last ten years or so, I think, pour-over coffee has been very trendy (and, usually, expensive). You often see these filter racks in coffee shops:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FXFyc.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FXFyc.jpg" alt="restaurant Melitta rack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell this is identical to the coffee brewing method I grew up with: the plastic Melitta cone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6DidM.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6DidM.jpg" alt="single Melitta cone"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were not really fancy coffee people. The cones were quick and easy (and storable in a cupboard, unlike a coffee machine). The coffee was tasty. For that matter, I still use a Melitta cone when I go camping. So my question is: &lt;em&gt;why did pour-over coffee become such a big deal?&lt;/em&gt; Is it just that the barista is making you a bespoke cup from scratch instead of pouring it from the urn? Or has there been some advancement in the state of the art in the last thirty years?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Pour over systems give you the ability to control the water flow through the coffee grounds with a high level of precision whereas a drip brewer does not.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will admit, this is a bit of a trend, but there are very real differences in the taste of a pour over versus a drip brewed cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blooming -- Gets rid of trapped Co2.  Easy to do in a pour over, whereas in a drip brewer, I don't believe the grounds are allowed to bloom.  If you don't let the Co2 offgas, you get metallic flavors in the cup.  Typically not really a problem since the majority of the gas is gone inside 12-24 hours anyways, but pour over allows you to completely optimize this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleanliness of cup -- pour overs are known for producing a very clean cup of coffee, that allows you to highlight the top notes in a coffee like florals or fruit flavors.  This is the polar opposite from French Press, and drip brewers either use paper filters that aren't pre-soaked so may relay a papery flavor to the coffee, or use a metal filter which will allow quite a bit more coffee oil through the filter and thus muddy the cup (slightly).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grounds saturation -- Typically drip brewers don't have a very good spray head in the drip brewer, so many times you can get a filter of grounds where the center is indented after brewing and the outer grounds may not even be wet in some cases.  Obviously, grounds not wet is a bad thing.  The indentation is also a bad thing.  It basically means that more water is being passed through the center of the filter than elsewhere which means you don't get even extraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timing -- You don't want to pass water through the grounds too fast, nor too slow.  The reasoning for this is variable solubility rates of different compounds in the coffee.  Case in point, if you grind really coarse and 'brew' your coffee in 1 minute, what's going to happen is the citric and malic acids in the coffee grounds will extract very easily and the other more complex flavor compounds will stay in the ground.  This is going to produce a sour cup of coffee.  Pour over allows you to make minute adjustments to ground saturation timing that can produce some wild flavors in a cup of coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this being said.. I still use a drip brewer for my morning cup of coffee because I'm usually running out the front door trying to get to work.  Does my drip brewer produce a good cup of coffee?  Absolutely.  Can I get a better cup of coffee with a pour over?  Probably.  It's simply a quality / time trade off.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What does Fair Trade guarantee?</title>

Of course it means i spend some extra cash that goes to the coffee producing farmers in exotic countries.
But i would like to know what the organisation is, that supervises the coffee trade, and what &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; the label guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you mean the coffee bean farmer by '&lt;em&gt;end-producer&lt;/em&gt;',
Fair Trade guarantees &lt;strong&gt;a relative increase of the contract&lt;/strong&gt; that the farmer can negotiate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say, for example a farmer gets USD 20,- for his entire crop usually, then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He might get USD 140,- for the same amount of beans when selling to a Fair Trade contracter.

  <title>How can I maximize cold brew yield without harming flavor?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Currently I make coffee two ways: hot coffee using a moka pot, and cold brew using a &lt;a href="https://toddycafe.com/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Coffee Toddy&lt;/a&gt;.  Both of these methods produce concentrated coffee.  However, I've noticed that my liquid yield for cold brew using the Toddy is less than half that of the moka pot, even when you take the differing strength of the concentrates into account.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it another way: when making moka, 12oz of coffee lasts me about 12 days, whereas for Toddy cold brew, it only lasts me around 7 days.  In fact, I can get a better cold coffee yield by making moka and pouring it over ice than I can doing cold brew -- but I don't want to go that way because it's so wasteful of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that cold brew will never have the extraction ratios of moka, but are there ways I can improve the yield for cold brew extraction, at least a little, without degrading the flavor?  Either using my existing Toddy system, or some other system?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It generally depends on your brew ratio (# grams of coffee to # grams of water) some people go with 1:6, 1:7, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And keep in mind the higher your ratio is the less concentrated the coffee will be, so for example if you brew 140 grams of coffee at the 1:7 ratio you would need to add about 980ml of water which would produce a larger yield than it would if you used the 1:6 ratio, but the later one would be more concentrated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also saw some people that use a lower ratios then dilute the yield with water to make it less concentrated. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to make thick, Indian style coffee without using instant coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently had coffee in India and it was quite thick. The way they made it they took instant coffee+sugar+little bit of water. They then beat this mixture into a thick paste. Then they added hot water and it turned out really delicious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked it; however, I'm wondering if it's possible to make this without using instant coffee? I'm not a big fan of instant coffee and have specific coffee beans I'm really a big fan of. I'm a coffee nooob so any advice on making a similarly thick coffee recipe? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Just like you described it. Add water a little by little, then took a spoon and swirl it. Then repeat, maintaining a thick paste, it will start to have a creamy colour. The most important thing is DON'T ADD TOO MUCH WATER until the paste is ready (you will know when), then it's ready to fill your cup with water and drink it (it will have a lot of cream, basically created by swirling and aeration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just try it and then repeat next time if it doesn't go as you want to.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I'm not a physician, so here are only guesses based on my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides coffeine, there are other substances to be taken into account, plus some non-chemical effects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar and milk by themselves can have relaxing effects. It is a well known fact that sugar can induce sleepiness, and hot milk is often drunk before going to bed. I've started drinking black coffee (no sugar) after lunch because of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk and coffee together are particularly hard to process by the stomach. This can bring a sort of after-lunch drowsiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be a psychological effect related to the assumption of coffee, or any other drink that is associated with relax and calm in your mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Why did my instant coffee turn dark and hard?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So I bought a jar of instant coffee not a year ago and it's not reached its expiry date. It's stored in the kitchen cabinet. Recently I opened it just to see its color had turned from coffee brown to something shiny black, solidified at the bottom. I tried scooping it out with a spoon, but it turned out to be hardened as granite. I managed to scrape a spoonful off, but it's still hard as rock. What do I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gwFIS.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gwFIS.jpg" alt="the photo shows coffee in the jar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The most sensible solution is to throw it out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instant coffee is hygroscopic, it will absorb moisture from the air if possible. I guess either someone was sloppy when scooping out the instant coffee and used a wet spoon or the container was not airtight (either bad packaging design or because a careless user didn’t close the pack properly). Now add high humidity to the mix and you will get the lump as seen in your post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are at least three reasons&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to discard this container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A) It’s a pain to pry it out and to dissolve it, as you have already observed. Pouring hot water straight into the container may help, but then there’s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B) The flavor is almost certainly not pleasant any more (see &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C) But the most important factor is food safety. If the granules got humid, there is a certain probability of bacterial and/or fungal growth and I would really recommend to discard the (ex-)coffee. I wrote more about food safety considerations &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3820/finding-if-coffee-is-a-health-risk-after-best-before/3825#3825"&gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt;, explaining the FAT TOM principle of food safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;————&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; There are some coffee snobs that would claim that instant coffee per se is disgusting enough to throw away, but we won’t go down that road here.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What am I supposed to do when coffee shop leave some coffee beans in my latte</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;New comer here, the coffee house serve my latte with 3 or 4 coffee beans floating on the foam, what am I supposed to do with them? eat them? pick them out? or drink it and spit the beans out? Sorry for asking such embarassing question, I like instant coffee but I'm not so familiar with coffee house&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You should eat floating coffee beans, will add extra caffeine and also beneficial antioxidants and nutrition compared with just the drink. On average a coffee bean does contain 12mg of caffeine, adding that to your drink will not change flavor but will just increase overall caffeine content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is like chocolate-covered coffee beans treats, get enough caffeine from a snack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On average, eight coffee beans provide an equivalent amount of
  caffeine as one cup of coffee. Your body absorbs caffeine from whole
  coffee beans at a quicker rate than that from liquid coffee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <title>How fine should I grind coffee for drip/pour over coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I manually grind coffee beans for drip coffee but I thought that depending on whether the coffee is intended to be used for a cafetiere or espresso machine then the fineness needs to be varied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the optimum fineness for drip coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it matter so much given that I am not using pressure (typically 15 bar in an espresso machine) to force hot water through the coffee grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In general consistency is more important than a specific setting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is that you can actually control both the size of the grind and actually achieve a homogenous grind allowing you to increase the consistency in the coffee when you brew it as you can assertively control the service area being exposed during the brewing process. Since you stated that you have a burr grinder you are off to a great start. There is no defined, agreed upon coarseness of grind for pour over coffee, but I would definitely say that you would want a courser grind than you would for espresso. Experiment to find the sweet spot by making sure you use exactly the same water, coffee bean roast, and number of beans (and thus volume) between different grind settings to find what meets your flavor best. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are particularly worried about "getting it right" or do not want to do a ton of experimentation an easy and quick way to jump to a grid would simply to go to a coffee shop, buy a bag of whole beans, ask them to grind it and query them for how coarse of a grind is. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Roast vs Body vs Acidity</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Coffee flavor is often described in terms of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roast darkness (light to dark)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Body (medium to heavy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acidity (smooth to bright)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a vague understanding of some of these, but am unclear especially on body. Could someone explain these a bit and show how they differ from one another?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm not really an expert, but in basic terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roast darkness: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roughly how long was the coffee roasted, much like toast, a longer roast usually brings about a darker flavor. Darker roast coffees tend to have a slightly burnt caramelized flavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Body:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I usually think of this as more of a texture than a flavor, probably more easily noticed at the extremes. A "full bodied" coffee sort of coats the tongue causing the flavor to linger while "medium bodied" coffees tend to be a little lighter with a cleaner finish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acidity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acidity is basically what it sounds like, lower acid coffees are often referred to as "smooth" and higher acid coffees referred to as "bright".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/52/roast-vs-body-vs-acidity#comment56_52"&gt;as mentioned in the comments&lt;/a&gt; these terms are really painfully relative, and somewhat rendered meaningless by an onslaught of advertisers claiming that their coffee is "smooth dark and full-bodied" regardless of the real characteristics. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>When to use stirring to increase extraction?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I often find that some methods of brewing for a particular implement differ on whether or not to stir the grounds at some point in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that stirring while brewing should increase the extraction, but when and why would I use stirring to do it instead of a finer grind, longer brew, higher temp, etc?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Stirring should be used if the grounds were not evenly dispersed in the beginning of the process for some reason (in immersion brewing methods).  For instance, when I am using my pour over at work, if my initial pour leaves some dry spots floating on top.  The Aeropress uses stirring prior to extraction presumably because the short time combined with the tube shape (narrow with all the grounds at the bottom) demand a good mixing.  I've seen many badly designed drip brewers that leave a chunk of dry grounds in the basket when done.  This is because the drip isn't dispersing water evenly and some of the grounds end up wasted,  finer grind, longer brew and temp won't necessarily help bad engineering in that case.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Do I need to boil the water before using my moka?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was recently told that I could improve the flavour of my moka pot coffee by boiling the water separately before putting it in the pot and assembling it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory goes that this means that the pot spends less time on the stove, meaning the grounds are less likely to be burned from the heat of the pot before the water has a chance to turn into steam and brew the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this true?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It is true. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preboiling the water will make the coffee tastes a lot better. It will reduce the bitterness and give space for a lot of other notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heating up the Mokka too much releases also metallic taste from the machine itself and you boil the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it easier to froth full-fat milk?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is it better to use whole (full-fat) or semi/skimmed milk for a cappuccino, or does it make no difference (other than the taste)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will one type of milk be easier to froth?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The short answer is yes. The absence of the milk fats means that the foam will not &amp;quot;coagulate&amp;quot; as easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proteins chains in milk are polar: one end of the chain is
hydrophilic (attracted to water), and the other is hydrophobic
(repelled by water). Because milk is mostly made up of water, as soon
as those proteins unfold, exposing their ends, the hydrophobic ends
immediately try to get as far away from that water as possible. If you
were to look at a single tiny bubble in a cup of foamed milk, you'd
see that the hydrophobic ends of the milk proteins are all pointed
inwards, towards the water-free interior of the bubble, while the
hydrophilic ends stay put in the aqueous environment the bubbles are
suspended in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This structure helps keep the air bubbles intact for a long time after the steaming &amp;gt; process, all the way into your cup (and into your happy, soon-to-be caffeinated mouth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <title>Reusable Nespresso pixie capsules</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Has anyone had experience with reusable Nespresso pixie capsules (similar concept to the Keurig capsules that you can fill/refill with ground coffee)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If so, Is the flavor and crema similar? Does the grind matter? Any other tips? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I used empty capsules to fill my own coffee and brew it using a Nespresso machine. I would say the result largely depends on the coffee you use, but not the capsules itself. It takes several tries until you get the right amount of coffee into one capsule (I had to stuff one brand of coffee quite tight to get a crema at all), and the amount differs very much from coffee to coffee. Of course, the grind matters a lot, but you can compensate with the amount of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem I had with the capsules is that sometimes they got stuck when discharging, but you can usually fiddle them out using a fork or so.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does a decaffeinated coffee have zero or little caffeine in it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Does any average kind of decaffeinated coffee have zero or very little caffeine in it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;We have yet to invent a process that removes 100% of the caffeine. When drinking decaf, the important question to consider is how likely you are to feel the effects of the trace amounts of caffeine that are left. That brings us, as most things do, back to the beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arabica has (on average) only &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; of the caffeine that Robusta contains. Now let's say you have a bag of Robusta where 80% of the beans have 1 - 2% of their original amounts, and 20% of the beans have 15% of their original amounts. Drop by drop, a shot of Robusta is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more likely to keep you awake or elicit other natural responses to caffeine than an identically-sized shot of Arabica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let's take that into context and not pick on Robusta so much - the single shot we mentioned might only contain 20mg of caffeine in total, meaning you wouldn't notice the effects any more than you would notice effects from the Arabica. The point is, you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;, so if you want to avoid caffeine, go with the milder bean and faster extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just goes to show, when you're talking about the characteristics of any coffee, the bean is pretty paramount - it can change the answer to any question completely in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Shaken, not stirred</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When making coffee and espresso concoctions at home I usually prefer them shaken, not stirred. I find that it changes the mouth feel and adds a nice head to cold drinks and even some hot drinks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a common practice in the coffee world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would your average barista have a cocktail shaker as a part of his/her standard kit?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Probably not, although more possible for financial reasons.  Shaking a coffee drink would either require a more sturdily constructed disposable cup, which would cost more money and create even more waste or a reusable shaker which would require cleaning in between customers which would cost money and time making the drink.  Either method would also incur a significant risk of losing the prepared drink in its entirety, necessitating a restart.  For a business, it's much less risky to simply let you customers stir their drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much French Press is a serving?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a small cafetiere for making French Press coffee. I can't remember what it said on the box when I bought it - it's quite old - but it seems similar to those advertised as '2-cup' size. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making coffee with it, filling it all the way up, makes a decent mugfull - what I'd consider enough for one person. Is this actually two 'servings' of french press? When I calculate how much caffeine I'm taking in, should I double the values given for French Press?&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;FDA has no official guidelines on serving size, so your serving size is either determined by the product manufacturer, or whatever you want it to be.

&lt;p&gt;What do all the letters mean? I'm assuming DECAF could be marked to distinguish a decaf in a large order, but why is it there twice? What about the other letters? What about 19 near the air hole? Why does it say NO LID?? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure it says NO TL316 LID.  That's the item/stock number for that particular size lid (based on a Google search, also available in black!). There are basically two sets of initials for the same thing Decaf, (C)ream, (S)ugar, (C-S) Cream and Sugar, and then one set has the B for Black.  Presumably these could be grease penciled or highlighted on a large order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly have no idea on the 19.  It may be some sort of internal tracking mechanism for manufacturing, because other examples from a Google image search have different numbers there.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How long will iced latte keep in the Fridge?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;If I make a batch of iced latte, that is to say I make a regular latte then pour it over ice, how long can I keep a batch fresh in the fridge? A day? A week? If the milk is the limiting factor, could I make a batch of espresso, chill that, and add milk as and when to get the same drink, or would it taste different if prepared this way?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;When I worked in a coffee shop and we prepared a beverage similar to an iced latte, we always mixed the milk in with the chilled espresso. Keep in mind this was a beverage prepared ahead of time and not server to the client right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;NEVER&lt;/strong&gt; added dairy to espresso and then chilled it for later.  It has been shown that 1 liter of milk can develop harmful bacteria after being in a room temperature space for as little as half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would highly recommend that you &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; prepare your iced lattes completely with milk and then chill them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend making the espresso, adding whatever sugar or flavor you want while it is still hot, chilling it in the fridge, and then adding milk to the espresso once it has been chilled or when you are looking to drink it. &lt;strong&gt;This will keep for a maximum of 48 hours.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all coffee, the fresher the better, but if you are indeed looking for a quick way to grab an iced latte, I would do so in the manner I described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I 'wet' the coffee first?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a recommended pouring time to perform all of this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;From this &lt;a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/make-better-pourover-coffee-how-pourover-works-temperature-timing.html"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start with a grind size around that of coarse sugar. (Think Sugar in the Raw.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;How much: Most pourover drippers work best when they're between one
  half to two-thirds full of coffee grounds. Any less than that, and
  there won't be enough coffee to restrict the flow. Any more, and your
  dripper may overflow. You'll also want to make sure you're dripping
  into a large enough vessel. If you're the more precise-measurement
  type, a good coffee-to-water ratio is between 60-70 grams of coffee
  per liter of water (a mass ratio between 1:16 and 1:14.)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ol start="2"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get your clean (filtered if you need it) brew water ready. You'll be using water that's about 30 seconds off boil if you're pouring
  straight out of your boiling kettle, or immediately off boil if you're
  pouring into a second pouring kettle. I like about 207°F for medium to
  light roasts, and about 10° lower for dark roasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start your clock and add enough water to soak all of the coffee (a little premature dripping is okay). Wait for the coffee bed to stop
  the initial swelling (about 30 seconds) before adding more water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continue your brew. Try to pour quickly, gently, and evenly across the surface of the coffee, pausing between pours to pace your brew to
  your target brew time (see below). The distance that your brew water
  drops can affect brew temperatures, as well as increase or decrease
  the amount of agitation that the falling water creates wherever it
  falls in the coffee bed. In general, the lower you pour from, the
  better, if for no other reason than it's the easiest to create and
  maintain consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;When you stop adding water, your dripper will continue to drip for
  between 20 and 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Your target total brew time is about 2.5 to 3 minutes for dark roasted
  coffee, and 3 to 4 minutes for medium to light roasted coffees. This
  includes the dripping time after you stop adding water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Or do, if you really want to. Almost no one does this as it tastes horrible, but my grandma actually used to eat the grounds at the bottom with some sugar, so I guess exceptions exist... &lt;/p&gt;

  positive control. After performing the gross behavioral study, the
  Antibacterial activity was evaluated against Gram
  - negative bacteria included; Escherichia coli , Proteus mirabilis , Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Both compounds at a
  concentration of 2 mg/ml showed similar anti bacterial activities
  against all tested bacteria, except for P. mirabilis , and the highest
  inhibitory effect was observed against P. aeruginosa using a modified
  agar diffusion method. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of
  caffeine was determined us ing a broth microdilution method in 96
  multi
  - well microtitre plates. MIC values ranged from 65.5 to
  250.0 ? g/ml for the caffeine isolated from coffee and 65.5 to 500.0 ? g/ml for green tea caffeine. Combination results showed additive
  effects against most p athogenic bacteria especially for P.
  aeruginosa, using both antibacterial assays. Key Words: Caffeine, MIC

&lt;p&gt;So there are a &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;q=coffee+alzheimers&amp;amp;btnG=&amp;amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;amp;as_sdtp=" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;whole bunch&lt;/a&gt; of studies that have been done that have investigated a potential link between coffee consumption and Alzheimers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, as always, is that these types of '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;cohort studies&lt;/a&gt;' are really difficult. Basically the way it works is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a load of volunteers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By doing questionnaires, work out everything about them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track them over a long period of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See if there's a statistically significant link between combinations of behaviours (such as drinking coffee) and a particular outcome (diagnosis of Alzheimers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the standard stuff applies here: you are not testing for &lt;em&gt;causation&lt;/em&gt;, only for &lt;em&gt;correlation&lt;/em&gt;. For example, ~80% of Americans drink coffee, but in other cultures this number varies a lot. If the coffee drinkers in your study are predominantly American, and the non-coffee drinkers are predominantly not, you have a whole bunch of confounding factors. Designing your study to avoid this kind of situation is really hard, especially when you're relying on volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also the issue of what exactly are you measuring? Someone might drink 3 cups a day now, but only has done for the past few years. Another person might drink 2 cups a day, but has done their whole life. Another person might drink 2 cups of decaff a day. Questionnaires are usually not sophisticated enough to capture this level of detail (partly because in your big expensive study you want to capture as much information about different behaviours as possible - not just coffee consumption).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember also that medical studies are &lt;em&gt;chronically&lt;/em&gt; badly reported in the mainstream press. Even in 'high-brow' publications, by the time the headline-writers get their hands on a study, the message can have changed &lt;em&gt;wildly&lt;/em&gt;. It's always worth trying to dig up the actual paper whenever new research is mentioned in the news. If no paper is linked, just ignore the headline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tool against all of this uncertainty is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_analysis" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;. This is where you look at every single study, weighted by how confident you are in the data (e.g. by weighting more to studies with more participants, and better questionnaires etc.). You then do some careful statistics work to get a measure of confidence across all of the studies. Think of it as a sophisticated way of 'averaging them out'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/174313206X152546" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;One of these was done&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. Only 4 studies had been done by then, but the conclusion was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although our pooled estimates show that coffee consumption is inversely associated with the risk of AD, the four studies had heterogeneous methodologies and results. Further prospective studies evaluating the association between coffee consumption and AD are strongly needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Heterogeneous is science for 'different')&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i.e., &amp;quot;Not sure yet, not enough data, but it looks promising, give us more money for research.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The pricier the better?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Simple observation: Whenever I shifted to &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; coffee, I always had to pay a little bit extra for coffee itself than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it hold true vice avers? Meaning, if price tag on coffee brand X is 10% more than coffee brand Y, can I say that brand X is better than brand Y without considering any other attributes? (e.g. location, fair trade and so on)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Short answer: &lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt; - up to a point&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long answer: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignoring things like Kopi Luwak etc, there is a cost associated with growing, harvesting and transporting arabica beans in a timely manner, roasting them while they're fresh, and getting them to somewhere you can buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go below this price, corners will be cut. You may get cheaper robusta beans, or a mix. You will get older, staler beans. You will get the poor end of the harvest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, go above that price and you're needlessly spending extra cash. You're now spending on marketing for the people you're buying it from. You're paying for a fancier bag, better branding etc. This may actually make it taste bette - &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0148296382900418"&gt;psychology is a powerful thing&lt;/a&gt;, but the beans you're getting won't be significantly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, this magic price-point is impossible to find, fluctuates wildly, and it's in the interests of suppliers to obfusticate it as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice would be to try a variety of coffees that you can afford and find one you like. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does caffeine raise cholesterol (good or bad)?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've heard that coffee can raise your cholesterol. If that's true, is it a bad thing? Is regular or acute exposure to coffee dangerous in this way?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coffee beans contain a chemical called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafestol" rel="nofollow"&gt;cafestol&lt;/a&gt;, which tends to increase blood cholesterol levels, especially LDL ("bad") cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brewing with a paper filter seems to reduce the levels of these cholesterol-raising chemicals in brewed coffee by filtering out these chemicals (e.g., cafestol, kahweol). Levels of cafestol in coffee are higher in non-paper-filtered brewing methods, such as French press and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/coffee/" rel="nofollow"&gt;one article&lt;/a&gt; that discusses this, and &lt;a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6242467/ns/health-heart_health/t/coffee-cholesterol" rel="nofollow"&gt;another pointed out by @apaul34208&lt;/a&gt; in comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Links to actual studies. Here are two studies that discuss this further: &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2029499" rel="nofollow"&gt;one from van Dusseldorp, et al., 1991&lt;/a&gt; that talks about "a factor" (i.e., an as-yet-unidentified compound) that has a cholesterol-raising impact. A later paper (Urgent, Katan 1997) &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9240930" rel="nofollow"&gt;identifies these factors as "diterpene lipids cafestol and kahweol"&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the abstract from the latter article states that &lt;em&gt;"[paper] filtered coffee does not affect cholesterol."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's the minimum recommended age for drinking a coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is there any minimum recommended age for drinking a coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In example for ground or instant (in case there is any difference)? I would assume there are no limits for a decaf coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In short: there is no minimum recommended age for drinking coffee, but on the other hand it's not good idea to have kids drink coffee all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is discussed in depth in the &lt;a href="//parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/637/how-long-should-i-wait-before-i-permit-my-children-to-have-access-to-caffeine"&gt;parenting site of Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; and the top answer thee states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that caffeine is generally safe, but it does have significant effects in children as well as adults. Note that children are much more likely to encounter caffeine in a soft drink than in tea or coffee; that's what you have to worry about, I think, not Starbucks. A cup of green tea contains ~15-25 mg of caffeine, which is around the limit where there were no noteworthy affects for a 50 kg child, so if they want to hang out at a cafe, they don't even have to limit themselves to strictly caffeine-free options&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I'm not going to allow my children to have coffee before they are in highschool - that's the age where they can start to decide on things affecting their health.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Do I need to clean my drip brew coffee maker's filter every time?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I remember days in the office that I was too busy to be bothered with rinsing the &lt;a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411FJQ559AL.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;filter&lt;/a&gt; and just tapped it hard over a trash bin, do my best to get all the used ground out of there and brewed a new batch as usual. Is this okay, health-wise (surely flavour will be affected a bit) especially since I'm using it everyday, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course when I stop using my dripper for a while, there would be molds in the filter and that prompts me to soap and give it a hot bath. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Looks like a standard metal mesh reusable filter! The mesh is probably stainless steel, perhaps with a gold-tinted coating, sandwiched between a plastic frame. They're alternatives to paper filters for filter/drip coffee. I find the outcome to be a little gritty/grainy; more like French press than a regular paper filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, if your filter is still performing well, I think &lt;strong&gt;you're probably fine with a shake-out, rinse, or occasional scrub&lt;/strong&gt;. However, &lt;strong&gt;any residue might impart off-tastes in your next brew&lt;/strong&gt; (hopefully what's left is just coffee remnants!). The leftover coffee stuck to your filter (that you didn't wash off) will oxidise, taste stale, etc. (See also &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/123/262"&gt;this question about coffee going stale&lt;/a&gt; -- one answer says it only takes minutes! And &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/160/262"&gt;this question about what's happening&lt;/a&gt; with stale coffee.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wet coffee grounds will mould if allowed to sit too long&lt;/strong&gt; as you report. So if you leave coffee in it, very wet, for a long time, you might be inviting flora and fauna that you don't want. You reported this in your question, but I'm surprised if it would happen very quickly. Clearly, when you have mould growing, you'll want to give it a good scrub. If you store your filter (grounds knocked out, even if not washed) in such a way that the filter can dry out more quickly (e.g., hanging, separate from the coffee maker, propped up to permit air flow, etc.) it seems that mould would have a harder time to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for getting clogged and occasionally needing a really thorough cleaning... I use a similar device for brewing tea, and it gets clogged sometimes. In fact, I wrote &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/51953/25286"&gt;this question/answer on Cooking.SE&lt;/a&gt; recently about how it had become clogged after a decade of use; see that for more on how to get such a metal mesh really clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A probably-obvious alternative is to use a paper filter. You could toss the whole thing into your compost bin (filter and spent grounds and all!) and everything on the coffee maker will dry out more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Do the size and shape of a cezve matter?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When brewing Turkish coffee in a cezve, it's generally recommended to fill with water up to the neck of the pot. Is it alright to use a bigger cezve (say, a double one) for making less coffee (e.g., a single demitasse)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the problem, if any, would relate to the fact that the water surface should be up in the cezve's narrow neck. A related question, therefore, is: does the narrowing-to-the-top shape of the cezve effect the brewing, and in particular, crema formation?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In short: &lt;strong&gt;Using a cezve of the correct size works better.&lt;/strong&gt; The situation is similar to using appropriate equipment size in other coffee preparation methods (other examples at the bottom).  That said, you can probably brew a passable cup of &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/483/difference-between-turkish-and-greek-coffee"&gt;Turkish (or other names)&lt;/a&gt; coffee when your &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cezve" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;cezve&lt;/a&gt; isn't full to the neck (or, using a cezve that's "too large"). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are reasons for the shape and size of a cezve (as you suggest in your question), and it really does help in practice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The narrower neck of the cezve keeps the foam form.&lt;/strong&gt; I haven't found any good references for an explanation; more discussion below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's easier to see what's happening.&lt;/strong&gt; Using a bigger pot, it would be more difficult to see when the boiling/foaming is happening. Some stir it down during brewing, some don't; either way, timing is important!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of brewing guides that suggest reasons; &lt;a href="http://www.howtobrewcoffee.com/Turkish.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;  suggests stirring down several times, and says the size is due to &lt;strong&gt;"physics"&lt;/strong&gt; without explanation; &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/01/how-to-make-turkish-coffee-at-home-in-an-ibrik-instructions-tips-technique-coffee-brewing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here's another&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://coffeegeek.com/guides/turkishcoffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This one from CoffeeGeek&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the shape (narrowing toward the top) helps &lt;strong&gt;to prevent the foam from burning to the side of the pot&lt;/strong&gt; (becoming bitter); this makes sense especially when using a small pot on a gas stove, when the heat will try to hug the sides of the pot. And &lt;a href="http://www.freshcup.com/brewing-turkish/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; doesn't say to stir. All of them suggest, but none that I could find explicitly &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; the reason why the foam forms better.  In a pinch, I have tried to make Turkish coffee in a regular handled pan; it simply doesn't work as well. Something magical happens in the neck of a cezve to help that delicious foam to form; the best I can figure is that it's fragile, and the narrower neck somehow helps concentrate the bubbles, helps keep the foam together, and keeps it from collapsing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other examples of equipment size mattering when you're making coffee with other methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moka pot. The size of the pot determines how much you brew at a time; can't really make more or less (though you &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1519/how-should-i-make-multiple-batches-quickly-with-a-moka-pot"&gt;could brew a few pots in a row&lt;/a&gt;). See also &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/moka" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;moka&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;moka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Espresso. Though you can make a single or double, and a &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/408/what-is-the-difference-between-a-long-luongo-and-a-short-ristretto-shot-of-e"&gt;long or short&lt;/a&gt;, you pretty much have to &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/415/how-do-i-know-when-to-stop-pulling-my-shot/"&gt;stop pulling at the right time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cone filter. For example, #2 and #4 and #6 coffee filters exist for a reason: it's hard to get a good pour of a 12-cup carafe of drip/filter coffee through a #2 filter; it's just too small.&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Does caffeinating my hair follicles help prevent hair loss?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In the UK there is a product being very heavily marketed at the moment: &lt;a href="https://www.boots.com/en/Alpecin-Caffeine-Shampoo-250ml_855542/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Caffeine Shampoo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From their copy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Caffeine Shampoo contains caffeine that can help to stimulate hair growth directly at the roots. A daily wash with Alpecin C1 shampoo immediately provides the hair roots with the activating ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpecin Caffeine penetrates even though the shampoo is rinsed out. In just a short time (120 sec.), caffeine travels along the hair shaft directly into the hair follicles. If the shampoo is left on for longer, the caffeine will also penetrate into the scalp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming it would be a little cheaper to rinse my hair with instant coffee in the shower rather than buy this product, but if I did, would it have any effect?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm aware of one &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; study (though there might be others) of that demonstrate that &lt;strong&gt;caffeine is effective at certain types of hair loss -- in a "test tube"&lt;/strong&gt;, anyway. That is, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17214716"&gt;this study from 2007&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-4632.2007.03119.x/abstract"&gt;another link from publisher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-a-cure-for-baldness"&gt;a colloquial summary of the study&lt;/a&gt;) took biopsy samples of follicles from men with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgenic_alopecia"&gt;AGA&lt;/a&gt; ("male pattern baldness") and treated them caffeine (and hormones), &lt;strong&gt;finding that caffeine was "a promising candidate for hair growth stimulation" and "may have important clinical impact".&lt;/strong&gt; Another note is that this is &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; -- which I take to mean topical in this sense -- drinking a bunch of coffee is unlikely to help (the summary article suggests that the dose necessary of orally-consumed coffee to get the same effect is ~6 &lt;em&gt;grams&lt;/em&gt; -- many dozens of cups of coffee, and perhaps fatal dose). If you don't happen to subscribe to the &lt;a href="http://www.intsocderm.org"&gt;International Journal of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt; you can obtain the &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-4632.2007.03119.x/epdf"&gt;PDF of this article&lt;/a&gt; for perhaps a small fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don't know if this has been demonstrated in any clinical trials.&lt;/strong&gt; I can't find any longitudinal studies of longer-term effectiveness, nor can I find any evidence of actual clinical trials. There are a few more links in the caffeine-related clauses at the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_hair_loss#Experimental_medication"&gt;management of hair loss Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as an aside, you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; get a little "caffeine buzz" from it! There are some &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower_Shock"&gt;bar soaps, like this one&lt;/a&gt;, that make the (largely unverified) claim that some of the caffeine is absorbed through your skin. Win-win?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To keep this on-topic..." As for using instant coffee or some other source of caffeine (e.g., pills) to be applied topically to your scalp, I can't find anything about that either. Concentrations cited in the study are "0.001% and 0.005%." &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean"&gt;Coffee beans themselves&lt;/a&gt; have about 1-4% caffeine before roasting, so it's reasonable to expect that you could get to the concentration used in the study with a paste of instant coffee, but I don't know about the "bioavailability" of caffeine from topical application of instant coffee. Robusta beans are generally on the higher end of caffeine content and might be cheaper. Also, green beans will have a higher caffeine content than roasted, but I might be taking this a bit too far...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

  <title>Is rate or consistency of flow related to quality when pulling a shot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Depending on the many variables applied when pulling a shot of espresso, the rate and consistency of the flow of the espresso varies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does variable speed or consistency suggest that a shot will be of lower quality? Conversely, does a steady speed and flow indicate that a shot will be of higher quality?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A more watery/lighter consistency with a high flow rate is going to leave you with a terrible tasting shot of espresso with too light of crema (this foam on top can tell you a lot about a pulled shot even if it does look as if it came out OK). The opposite applies here to, a super dark and slow pouring shot can occur too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my 4 years of coffee house experience using professional grade equipment it all came down to the grind size. You can tell just by the way the shot pours out. If it's quick make the grind a little finer, if it's slow make it a bit more coarse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also depending on the temperature in the room can effect the pulls as well, half way through my morning shifts I would have to adjust the grind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;instant coffee to have less caffeine&lt;/strong&gt; than the methods involving filtering.&lt;br&gt;
I just can't get my head around that, as in instant (e.g., Nescafe) coffee preparation we practically put the coffee into the cup and eat it.&lt;br&gt;How is it possible filtered beans to have more caffeine than eaten beans?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;With instant coffee, you are not "practically eating the beans;" you are drinking reconstituted dried &lt;em&gt;coffee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create &lt;em&gt;instant coffee&lt;/em&gt; granules, the manufacturer first brews the coffee using conventional methods and then either freeze-dries or spray-dries the coffee to create a soluble powder form. Dried coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of caffeine in the instant coffee will depend largely the original brewing process. Since commercial instant coffee is created in very large volumes, they are likely extracting coffee faster than our meticulous home-brewed methods. So while caffeine is water soluble, it takes &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; time for the caffeine to be extracted and absorbed in the water than other compounds. And "more time" is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; something that the mass-produced instant process allows. Less extraction time = less caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

Coffee grounds are simply the ground up seeds found inside the berry of the &lt;em&gt;coffea&lt;/em&gt; plant, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;so eat up!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Even after the beans have been ground and extracted into your favorite coffee beverage, they still contain plenty of caffeine and are perfectly digestible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before people learned to brew coffee, folks were eating the beans to get that coffee boost. Today we eat straight coffee beans through all sorts of preparations. Chocolate covered espresso beans are quite popular and pack quite the kick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating coffee beans has even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; effect than &lt;em&gt;drinking&lt;/em&gt; coffee because not all of the caffeine is extracted through your brewing process. According to the &lt;a href="http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2013/acs-presspac-january-9-2013/used-coffee-grounds-are-a-rich-source-of-healthful-antioxidants.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, leftover coffee grounds from filter and espresso-type coffeemakers are especially abundant in antioxidants. Plus, you'll get all the benefit of the dietary fiber that's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; present in your morning brew.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can flavoured coffees alter the shelf life of the coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Flavouring a coffee involves introducing flavour oils to the beans after roasting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am assuming that the shelf life of an object is measured as the minimum shelf life of its components, so is it possible for these flavour oils to reduce the longevity of the roasted bean, or do flavour oils have as long, if not longer shelf lives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By shelf life, I mean the length of time before it is unsafe for consumption. Whether the flavour of flavoured coffee degrades at a different rate to unflavoured coffee is most likely a whole new question entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You are quite right - the flavouring does indeed change the shelf life in a certain way. It is necessary to look at this from two perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelf Life by Safe Consumption:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flavouring compounds used to flavour coffees last longer without degrading. This means that they &lt;strong&gt;ARE NOT&lt;/strong&gt; the limiting factor when it comes to the shelf life of a coffee. &lt;strong&gt;Therefore, shelf life is not changed by flavouring the coffee as these compounds degrade (or go bad) after the coffee itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelf Life by Taste:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the coffee has been treated with flavouring compounds, it will hide certain aspects of degradation of the coffee due to aging, decaffeination, and oxidation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In addition, these flavors help extend the shelf life of coffee by
  disguising changes in flavor due to decaffeination, oxidation, or
  aging processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://www.madehow.com/Volume-3/Flavored-Coffee-Bean.html"&gt;How Products are Made&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, shelf life by taste is changed, as the flavouring compounds mask the degradation and therefore the bad tastes of the aging coffee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee on daily basis</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if coffee has serious health issues because I take coffee on daily basis. Can anyone tell me what are the possible health issues on consuming the coffee on daily basis?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coffee and in particular caffeine, has had a reputation of being bad for your health, possibly being associated with cardiovascular disease, stroke, and your heart health in general.  &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/upshot/more-consensus-on-coffees-benefits-than-you-might-think.html?_r=0&amp;amp;abt=0002&amp;amp;abg=1"&gt;Current consensus&lt;/a&gt; is that there may actually be some health benefits from drinking coffee, and those that drink moderate amount of coffee (3-5 cups) have lower risk with these particular issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of things to note, these results have been found to be associated with black coffee, not including the effects of sweeteners or dairy added to the drink.  These additions may have other effects stemming from the sugars they add to you beverage. Also, some evidence has been found linking coffee prepared in a method that does not use a paper filter (e.g. french press) with increased &lt;a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6242467/ns/health-heart_health/t/coffee-cholesterol/#.VVzrbmPr99Q"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Homemade Highlander Grogg</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I used to really like the flavored coffee Highlander Grogg, but now all I can taste is the artificial aftertaste.  Is there a non-artificial additive that I can add to a different variety of coffee to make it taste like Highlander Grogg?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's the butterscotch flavor that distinguishes Highlander Grogg, but I don't know what the history of the flavor is. If it's as Scottish as the name implies, I'm guessing it's got some deep rich history.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;For certain high-intensity flavours, often people use &lt;em&gt;extracts&lt;/em&gt; (think stuff like "vanilla extract") or &lt;em&gt;essential oils&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., oils that are the "essence" (or are infused with same) of a given plant or something). This allows you to use a very small amount of the flavouring substance in something like coffee or confectionery or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, certain extracts or might just be artificial themselves, and give you that same "off" after-taste. This might be what's in your bag of beans/grounds and why you're in this predicament in the first place. The ingredient label might have some hints but is probably not helpful ("natural and/or artificial flavourings" perhaps). Here's one (judgemental) example of how the ubiquitous &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/02/the-dark-side-of-flavored-coffee-how-flavored-coffee-is-made.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;hazlenut flavoured coffee (from Serious Eats)&lt;/a&gt; could be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For butterscotch that you cite, for example, you could use something like butterscotch extract &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004XWBWGC" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;(example from Amazon)&lt;/a&gt;. You could also use some other &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/3158/what-is-the-difference-between-butterscotch-caramel-and-toffee"&gt;caramel or butterscotch syrup&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2009/12/ridiculously-easy-butterscotch-sauce/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;make your own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For particular flavours, after you've identified them, you might ask over at &lt;a href="http://cooking.stackexchange.com"&gt;Seasoned Advice&lt;/a&gt;. But I'm glad you asked here first :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does coffee affect people from all races the same?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I strongly assume that, if the looks from people all over the world vary, then also there metabolic system should vary and wonder, if there are noticeable differences how caffeine affects people from different cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to look it up on the Internet, however I didn't find much, so I would assume there is not much of a difference. But surely there are people, who know a lot more than me in this field. Therefore I were very happy for any constructive comment. &lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Should I use the airtight container, or the opaque container?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I know that ideally, I should keep my ground coffee in an airtight, opaque container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I'm limited to one that is airtight, but glass, and one that is opaque, but not that airtight (it's actually a bag with a zip seal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I get around to getting a decent new container, which is the best to keep my ground coffee in?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I value &lt;em&gt;sealed&lt;/em&gt; over &lt;em&gt;opaque&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Go for the sealed glass. &lt;em&gt;Opaque&lt;/em&gt; is not really the goal, but rather &lt;em&gt;in the dark&lt;/em&gt;. Keeping the stuff in a dark location, even in a clear container, will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as priorities for storage in general, &lt;a href="http://www.ncausa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=70"&gt;according to the USA National Coffee Association&lt;/a&gt; (and others including &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/frequency/store-coffee?tonx=1"&gt;Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2010/10/the-coffee-storage-conundrum-how-to-keep-beans-fresh/64118/"&gt;lengthy missive from The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;), there are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;four things&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that are most important for coffee freshness; that is, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;minimizing exposure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;air&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moisture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;light&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... &lt;em&gt;in that order&lt;/em&gt;, according to NCAUSA (first link above). That is, keep it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sealed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (minimizing airflow and humidity, most important), &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (but not cold/refrigerated), and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in the dark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (somewhat less important). The best place to do this is in an airtight container in a dark, cool pantry. If kept in a dark place, you don't even need to make the container opaque. Lastly, the "light" factor is the lowest in priority, so "mostly dark" is probably good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to re-use coffee containers for this purpose (I have a bunch of &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001E5DYTO"&gt;illy cans such as these&lt;/a&gt; that work well, are a good size, and have a one-way valve on the bottom).

  <title>How do I heat this very old vacuum pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;We recently found this old vacuum pot at my grandparents`. It seems to have all the parts needed for brewing, but no separate heater. We didn't dare to put it on a ceramic stove without further knowledge. All we know is it was last used some 40 to 50 years ago.  It says "Original Santos" on the side and seems to have capacity for 8 cups. The bottom is flat, and has no burn marks (in case a heater would leave some). We have access to ceramic stove, but is this safe to use on it? Are there any other options, possibly in Do-it-yourself spirit? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm starting a bounty for any &lt;em&gt;precautions&lt;/em&gt; I should take if I am to place this old treasure on a ceramic stovetop. Any tricks to make sure it will not explode? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fmdh2.jpg" alt="the vacuum pot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Great find! How fun. You do indeed have a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_coffee_maker" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;vacuum coffee maker&lt;/a&gt; -- a.k.a. vac-pot, syphon, or siphon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This style of vac-pot is intended to be used on a stove-top&lt;/strong&gt; (specifically: having a flat bottom, and with a handle on the neck of the bottom part -- the "bulb") -- looks a lot like &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00005NCX5" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this current model from Bodum - c/o Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. There's a good primer on &lt;a href="http://www.wecravecoffee.com/siphon-vacuum-coffee-makers-a-complete-guide/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the history and types of vac-pot at WeCraveCoffee&lt;/a&gt; with some good pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in general, &lt;strong&gt;glass pots are generally not recommended on flat &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass-ceramic#Cooktops" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;glass-ceramic cooktops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for a couple of reasons: they can &lt;em&gt;scratch or otherwise damage&lt;/em&gt; each other, and the poor conductivity of glass makes glass-on-glass heating &lt;em&gt;less efficient&lt;/em&gt;. More info on this from &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/23051/what-kind-of-cookware-is-suitable-for-a-glass-ceramic-stovetop"&gt;a question on Seasoned Advice&lt;/a&gt;, and recommendations from &lt;a href="http://www.geappliances.com/search/fast/infobase/10000221.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;GE Appliances&lt;/a&gt; for their own stovetops. I did see some products &lt;a href="http://www.dhgate.com/product/unified-little-mini-electric-ceramic-stove/235473464.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;such as this one&lt;/a&gt; that depicted glass vac-pots on glass-ceramic cooktops. If all of the glass is high quality, as should be expected for cookware intended to be used on a stove, it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to withstand the temperature changes induced by a cooktop. I (personally) would be comfortable using this vac-pot on a &lt;em&gt;gas&lt;/em&gt; flame, but cautious/wary of using it on glass-ceramic cooktop. Glass cookware works well over gas flame, but I have less experience with glass cooktops... your "mileage" may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more "DIY" adventure as you suggest, &lt;strong&gt;consider a mechanism to suspend the vac-pot over a flame heat source&lt;/strong&gt;. Other styles of vac-pot (such as &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000IKLQY6" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this Hario model - c/o Amazon&lt;/a&gt;) have a scaffolding that holds the bulb (bottom) and the hopper (top) so the whole apparatus can be suspended over a separate heat source, like an alcohol or butane stove. Check some vac-pot brewing guides that show this type of integrated round-bottom bulb and holder (e.g., from &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/siphon" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/vacuum-pot" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Stumptown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://coffeegeek.com/guides/siphoncoffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;CoffeeGeek&lt;/a&gt;, and many others). Warning: this may remind you of Chemistry lab from School. ;-) And of course be careful with fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, just for completeness...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also looks like you're missing the filter piece. These are inexpensive (relative to the whole apparatus) and you'll want to purchase a new, compatible one anyway (see also another question on &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/253/how-often-do-i-need-to-change-the-filter-on-a-siphon"&gt;siphon filter replacement&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another thing you'll want to check is that the rubber seal between the bottom and top parts is still in good shape&lt;/strong&gt;, especially if this pot hasn't been used in a few decades. This is for reasons both practical (you need a tight seal for the vacuum to work well) and safety (you don't want the seal to come lose and spray boiling-hot water everywhere)!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does making Bali Coffee change the amount of caffeine compared to filter coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Bali coffee is made by tossing finely ground coffee directly in the water (no filters, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this change the amount of caffeine in the coffee, compared to coffee from a filter machine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Coffee produced on Bali is generally Robusta rather than Arabica which means it has more caffeine, but I would like to know about the change in caffeine due to the process alone)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The amount of caffeine in your cup will depend, as with any method, on the extraction time. It also depends on everything else, e.g. the grind, temperature of the water, but I can't find any information on what these typically are for Balinese coffee, so I'm going to assume they're the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you're using the same coffee with each method, the main thing that will vary is the extraction time. With pour-over methods, this will depend on the size and shape of the funnel, the porousness of the filter paper and the grind itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Balinese coffee, there is no control. If you mix the coffee and water directly, the only thing limiting the extraction time is how long you wait before drinking it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, having said that, caffeine is actually extracted rather quickly. &lt;a href="http://www.pjbs.org/pjnonline/fin2208.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; finds that routine percolation removes almost all soluble caffeine. However, the extended extraction time for Balinese coffee is likely to make a bitter brew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In conclusion, no&lt;/strong&gt;, you won't get more caffeine in Balinese coffee compared to filter. Both methods will remove almost all caffeine from the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it possible to make latte-art with a coffee machine that has a cappucinatore?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My coffee machine has a cappucinatore and makes the coffee; milk first and then the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to do latte-art in this way? I've always seen the coffee being first and then the milk second so I'm not sure if it's possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to be able to make latte-art while it's normally operating, so no storing the coffee/milk in other containers and then building it later. Would it be possible?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Latte art typically requires you to pour one thing into the other (the frothed milk into the espresso). You could of course try to move the cup with the milk already in it while brewing the espresso in such a way that the coffee leaves a pattern in the milk. But that will be very difficult and will also look very different from normal latte art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So no, that will not really be possible. You should steam your milk in a pitcher and pour it from there into the cup with the espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I add cardamom to aeropress?</title>

Currently I use &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/aeropress" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;aeropress&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;aeropress&lt;/a&gt; to brew coffee at home. Is there any way to add cardamom to the brewing routine?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You'll probably be able to get away simply with ground &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardamom" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;cardamom/cardamon&lt;/a&gt; added to the grounds&lt;/strong&gt; when you're "pre-infusing"/steeping the coffee grounds in the AeroPress. It's probably best to use &lt;strong&gt;very finely ground, freshly ground&lt;/strong&gt; cardamom seeds. You may even wish to &lt;strong&gt;grind the cardamom seeds along with your coffee&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., in the grinder at the same time); you'll get similarly-fine grind. However, you might get a bit of cardamom flavour left over in the grinder; this may (not) be desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As another option, you could also consider &lt;strong&gt;a sprinkle of the dry, ground spice into the cup after brewing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to cardamom or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_cardamom" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;black cardamom&lt;/a&gt;, one might also consider cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, anise, or other "baking spices." Any of these could be used in a similar way. For example, I sometimes use freshly grated nutmeg in the grounds when brewing pour-over, and it gives a nice smell and a hint of flavour in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also &lt;strong&gt;consider using an extract or essential oil&lt;/strong&gt; or some high-intensity flavouring like that. You'd probably want to add that to your cup &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see a few problems that you might have to work around&lt;/strong&gt;, specific to AeroPress, that you might run into with any of these spices. One problem you might encounter is the &lt;em&gt;rather short infusion time&lt;/em&gt; commonly used in AeroPress; an option might be to try to &lt;strong&gt;steep the spice in the water as you're bringing it to the boil&lt;/strong&gt;, but you risk burning the spice or otherwise contaminating the kettle (but might be worth a try to boil in a regular cooking pan). Another problem is that some spices have a rather strong hydrophobic tendency (specifically, cinnamon), so it might be necessary to stir the grounds more thoroughly than usual, to make sure the spices are infusing in the water. Also, these spices might leave behind some flavour in the AeroPress, so do consider washing thoroughly and soon after the brew. And you might get a hint of the spice next brew... so make sure it's something that you won't mind in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; More thoughts based on &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/2430/262"&gt;a later question&lt;/a&gt;: There's a few other suggestions from recipes like &lt;a href="http://www.kinfolk.com/recipe-cardamom-coffee/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/try-this-cardamom-coffee-180331" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; (somewhat arbitrary top search hits). The former suggests &lt;em&gt;using a French press / cafetière&lt;/em&gt; (providing longer steeping time for the spice) and the latter recommends &lt;em&gt;grinding the spice with the coffee beans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;how much caffeine in a raw coffee bean? As in, raw, freshly picked, just remove hard outer shell and eat the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://coffee-channel.com/much-caffeine-coffee-bean/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;about 6 mg&lt;/a&gt; of caffeine in one coffee bean. Darker roasts may have 10-15% less. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;...dark roasts have a stronger taste, but the roasting procedure they experience decreases their caffeine content by 10 to 15 percent. If you prefer dark roasted beans, congratulations! They basically contain 15% to 20% less caffeine than the lightly roasted ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the answers to this &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/304/is-it-possible-to-feel-any-effects-after-chewing-one-coffee-bean"&gt;Question&lt;/a&gt; there is plenty of information about this subject. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What makes a coffee turn out sour?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've heard a few good things about Intelligentsia coffee so I decided to order some. Once it arrived I tried it in my AeroPress and it turned out very, very sour. (several times)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steps taken using AeroPress:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rinsed filter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;used water that was 1 minute off boiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brewed for 1:30 total&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plunged just until I heard air through the filter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee was so sour I couldn't finish it. Considering that I tried several times and that I've been using the AeroPress with great success for the past few months this has me very curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a coffee turn out sour?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;When the water has too short of a time to extract the flavor from the bean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try grinding the beans a bit smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Triple venti meaning at Starbucks</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;At Starbucks I asked for venti with an extra shot. The barista called it a triple venti. What does the triple mean? I thought and a Google search confirmed that a venti comes with 3 espresso shots, so what does the triple refer to?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Refers to those shots of espresso. You have 2 in there by default. (The &lt;em&gt;iced&lt;/em&gt; Venti drinks typically get 3, because the cup is a little larger (24 oz.))&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Office bean-to-cup machine tastes acidic in the morning</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In our office we have a bean-to-cup machine. The rate at which we use it means we always have fresh beans - generally it tastes pretty good for machine-made coffee. However, first thing in the morning, just after turning it on, the first few coffees can taste very acidic indeed. Is there any potential remedy for this other than throwing away the first few coffees?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;My thought is that once you turn on the machine, the machine starts to heat the water. Often the heating system is regulated by a PID regulation (Maybe on-off regulation). The machine will heat the water fast to make sure you can get your cup of coffee:) Once the water is heated it will stabilize to the intended temperature. If the water is heated above the intended temperature it will cause acidic compounds to be extracted from the beans. After a while the temperature is stabilized and you will experience that the coffee is no longer acidic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another theory is that the pipes within the machine are not clean. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can test both. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try turning on the machine an hour before making the first cup. If this helps it is probably a temperature issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not try to clean the machine by running through hot water before making the first cup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope one of these solutions will help you with your issue.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Easiest way to brew an espresso in the office?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In our office we only have an automated espresso machine that makes capuccinos, lattes etc. and of course they all taste awful. It's fully automated, so there's no way to use your own coffee with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to find a way to be able to brew my own coffee at the office so that I can just bring my ground coffee with me and make an awesome cup.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Probably closest to an espresso is an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroPress"&gt;AeroPress&lt;/a&gt;, which is similar to a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press"&gt;French press&lt;/a&gt;, but uses manual pressure to extract more aromatic componds while being lower on bitter and sour notes than most other methods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course all the "hand filter" varieties of the drip-family can be an option, if it's simply &lt;em&gt;coffee&lt;/em&gt;, not exactly &lt;em&gt;espresso&lt;/em&gt; you are after. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case you'll need a source of freshly boiled water, e.g. an electric kettle and - important for some offices - the permit to use it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course a good cleaning of the office machine, adjusting it properly and filling it with good beans might be also a step in the right direction... (And have you checked - many machines &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a little hidden "door" or similar where you can use your own (ground) coffee.)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What large batch cold brewing methods are available?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;It seems that there are very few large batch options. There are obviously the consumer products, then there are a couple "commercial" 5 gallon type systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm looking to fill multiple 5 gallons kegs for consumption and distribution. I understand that I could do a heavy batch of concentrate in a 5 gallon batch and dilute it with water when I put it into the kegs, but are there any methods available that don't involve the extra step?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I want to go bigger am I going to have to do something custom?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you're starting a small business, in which case, you will quickly outgrow 5 gallon batch sizes as you begin distribution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your needs, I would suggest purchasing industrial beer brewing equipment, such as conical fermenters and brite tanks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use of Conical Fermenter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JtmjA.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JtmjA.jpg" alt="Conical Fermenter"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conical fermenter would allow you to long brew a batch, bubble nitrogen or CO2 up from the bottom for agitation (increasing extraction and preventing oxidation), and will let the grinds settle into the bottom shoulder of the tank when the brewing process is complete. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use of Brite Tanks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iggKD.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iggKD.jpg" alt="Large Brite Tank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brite tanks come in a range of sizes from ~1 gallon up to tens of thousands of gallons. They are primarily used as a glycol jacketed pressure rated storage vessel for keeping beer (and similar beverages) in optimial conditions before storage. They may also be used as part of the forced carbonation of the liquid in the tank.  A brite tank will be useful for your cold brew business as you scale up because it will give you an intermediary vessel to blend out and store batches before packaging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scaling up your production&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your business plans and packaging / distribution ability, 
you will probably want to start with a slightly larger setup that gives you 1) room to grow and 2) the ability to expand without changing process or systems. Beer equiptment is well suited to meet these goals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Quality, consistency, and some notes on process:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of consumers demand a consistent product with an interesting flavor-profile that they can enjoy &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; time they purchase your product. Flavor-profile deviations will cause you to loose consumers to a more consistent product in the long run. The following points will help ensure a more consistent product: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blend out batches of cold brew from the fermenters into a single brite tank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use CO2 or nitrogen to prevent oxidation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;manual agitation is inconsistent - use a bubbler with CO2 or nitrogrn instead. This will also help with goal 2. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packaging lines make a huge difference. Invest for growth in a rotary topper, not a 4 or 6 head. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't attempt to use the same blend of beans for cold brew, draft cold brew, and nitro. &lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Should coffee be regulated?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;A couple of questions/answers on this site make it clear that many people feel that coffee is addictive, at least for some fraction of consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My question, for those who believe coffee is addictive, is whether and how it should be regulated? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am leaving the notion of "regulated" open. It could mean banning sales of coffee to minors, collecting a surtax to fund treatment, printing warnings on containers, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the emerging addiction-lore on the web I think it would be naive to assume that coffee would never be regulated. So I am interested in the extent to which people entertain or support regulatory ideas we currently associate with more potent drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one really believes that coffee is harmful and addictive, wouldn't one at least support a warning label on cups? Restricted sales to minors? The dangers listed in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2127/will-i-be-addicted-to-caffeine"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; well-received answer, if one accepts them, seem to commend at least mild warnings.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edited 11/13 to link earlier question/answer. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Generally, governments find it necessary to regulate addictive substances due to quality of life or health issues that stem from abuse/addiction. While I will neither support or attack this kind of reasoning, when you think about children born addicted to heroin or methamphetamine, the property crimes generally associated with addiction, and the additional strain on our health care system, you can begin to at least understand it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee addiction is far less financially taxing (my dependence costs me roughly $10/week or less), less likely to disturb my health in any appreciable way, and socially acceptable at all levels of society.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffee industry generates plenty of revenue for government as is.  Starbucks is paying their taxes just like every other corporation.  Creating an additional branch of government employees to regulate or adding additional employees to an existing administration (FDA perhaps?) are all expenses to regulate something that isn't currently a problem.  So it's an expense without any appreciable benefit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR  Since coffee is a low impact and highly supportable dependence, government has little or nothing to gain by regulating it's use.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have noticed when travelling that in some coffee spots in various countries in Europe, this type of coffee is not available. Unless it has a different naming than I am aware.&lt;br&gt;
Is this called American coffee? Because I know that Americano is a type of espresso so it is not the same&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The drip-type coffee is available in many countries in Europe. A list of names:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Filterkaffee&lt;/em&gt; in Germany / Austria / Switzerland &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;filterkaffe&lt;/em&gt; in Denmark and Sweden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;filterkoffie&lt;/em&gt; in the Netherlands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;kawa filtrowana&lt;/em&gt; in Poland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;café filtre&lt;/em&gt; in France / Switzerland / Belgium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;café filtro&lt;/em&gt; in Spain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;caffè preperato con il filtro&lt;/em&gt; in Italy / Switzerland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you see a pattern here: Always a combination of &lt;em&gt;coffee&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;filter/filtered&lt;/em&gt;. The terms are so closely related that if you order "&lt;em&gt;filtered coffee&lt;/em&gt;" an attentive waiter should be able to help you even if you don't know the precise term at your destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that if you order "coffee" &lt;em&gt;without specifying the preparation&lt;/em&gt;, you will be served the local "default". This will actually be filtered coffee in many countries of Northern and Central Europe, in Italy, as counter-example, you will get what you'd call "espresso", likewise in Spain or Portugal: small, strong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking for &lt;em&gt;caffè americano&lt;/em&gt; will &lt;em&gt;perhaps&lt;/em&gt; get you an espresso diluted with hot water in some places in Italy (sources vary whether it's a remenant from WW II or started with international tourism), sometimes &lt;em&gt;caffè all'americana&lt;/em&gt; ("coffee American-style") will get you drip coffee. Likewise in touristy areas of Spain, &lt;em&gt;café americano&lt;/em&gt; might get you a diluted coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further north you won't be understood. They will probably direct you to the nearest Starbucks.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can you make Peanut butter flavoured coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Has anyone had any luck making peanut butter flavoured coffee?  If so, what process did you use?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h2&gt;Peanut butter coffee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by your question I did some experimentation. Peanut butter itself did not work well for me, I could not get it to mix well. I happened to have a powdered penut butter, this worked much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m9Mfp.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m9Mfp.jpg" alt="Peanut Butter Powder"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added it like it was powdered cream and sure enough it tasted like peanut butter coffee! The perfect ratio for me seemed to be 2 tbsp per 6 oz cup. It was much better with a little sugar, even though I typically don't add sugar to my coffee. It tasted good, smells great, was more filling then a normal cup of coffee. But the taste was not great, so i won't be drinking it again unless I find a way to improve the taste. The bottom of the cup was very bad because it did not mix fully. So i would recommend blending for anyone who wishes to recreate the coffee treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iS9WJ.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iS9WJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Coffee Peanut Butter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While disapointed with PB coffee. Coffee flavor peanut butter is awesome. Specifically Chocolate Coffee Peanut Butter. As its probable inventor it shall now be called Mocha-PB!  Same ingredients as above except use a chocolate flavored powdered Peanut Butter and change the ratios. Use the instructions on the back of the powdered peanut butter but use hot coffee instead of water. Tastes great on a salty cracker or toast.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Should the filter capacity be matched to the brew amount?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I understand the of course the filter must be able to contain at least the amount of grounds for the cups you intend to brew. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I am using an &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001K66LPQ" rel="noreferrer"&gt;8-12 cup machine&lt;/a&gt; even though I live alone and generally only make 2-4 cups in the morning (sometimes 6 if I take some to work). &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001UBNRH6" rel="noreferrer"&gt;My filters&lt;/a&gt; are thus also that size. I use &lt;a href="https://www.cajungrocer.com/french-market-coffee-chicory-creole-roast.html?cvsfa=1338&amp;amp;cvsfe=2&amp;amp;cvsfhu=31373436&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKEAiA1o-zBRDomsWasvKh4S8SJADSlZkqf7B2ikYJXNaZM92s0zvKEDCUUrQrKSJVR8N_K2JtzRoCLBzw_wcB" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this coffee.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a recent trip to India and having enjoyed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_filter_coffee" rel="noreferrer"&gt;filter coffee&lt;/a&gt;, I started paying a bit more attention to try to get closer to that style (hence the chicory coffee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compression appears to be key for this style of coffee. With a flat-bottom, 8-12 cup filter with only 3 tbsp of grounds, the grounds appear to be very loose (obviously).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I then try to stamp it down a bit with the tablespoon, but this makes the layer quite thin in my very non-expert opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the brewing is done and I dispose of the filter, I notice that there is a hole in the middle of the grounds where you can directly see the filter (no hole through the filter itself).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not so picky about taste, but this made me think that perhaps such a wide filter may not be suited for the small amounts I'm brewing. Is this true?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I would agree with you.  With the thin flat layer of coffee the hot water is just pushing a hole right through it.  You are not getting nearly the contact time of a full size brew.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it was conical or V shaped filter then it would better accommodate different size batches.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that pot it does not look like you could just simply use a different filter size.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What coffee and roast are best for Turkish?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Following a stream of very good discussions about aspects of &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/turkish-coffee"&gt;Turkish coffee&lt;/a&gt; preparation, here's a question about coffee selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different brewing methods are thought to highlight different aspects of coffee aroma (e.g., darker roasts for espresso, but lighter for cold brew; see the &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1562/277"&gt;discussion here&lt;/a&gt;). So often when you buy beans at a roastery, there is a recommendation regarding which methods are good for these beans &amp;amp; roast. Thus, a random bag of beans I'm looking at suggests they are good for batch-brew, aeropress, pourover and french press, but not for moka of espresso. But because Turkish isn't a big thing in many countries, it's never mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May uneducated impression is that Turkish preserves the acidity and keeps bitterness low. Do you guys know what its profile really is?
Alternatively, maybe there is a way to predict the suitability of particular 
beans for Turkish based on its character compared to other methods. E.g., "beans good for aeropress will often be good for Turkish", or "Turkish is the opposite of espresso", etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I know when I like the coffee I made, so there are some favourites to my taste. But I can't disentangle the factors that contribute to my liking: is it the roast? the altitude? the mouthfeel? Which means I don't know what is more relevant, and this don't have properties to guide me in choosing new beans.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I believe the answer will be subjective. But, I can answer based on some tradition and history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffee beans &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; originated from Yemen in Ottoman Empire. At least, Yemen was a hub. (This fact is even mentioned in folk songs. See &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFrRS9aNJJQ" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://tr.wikisource.org/wiki/Kahve_yemen&amp;#39;den_gelir-1" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Historically, Robusta beans were not around, yet. Americas were not explored. So, if you want to follow the tradition, stick with African originated Arabica beans. Still, one should note that if you go for the current Turkish commercial ground coffee brands (like Mehmet Efendi, etc.) on the market, most of them include mostly Robusta beans from South America to keep the costs low. This is ugly face of horeca, I assume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(African originated Arabicas are also my personal preference. My favorite is Ethiopian Harar. As far as I experienced, it is even better than Kopi Luwak for Turkish coffee. Also, this may be a hint. Kopi Luwak is known for low acidity. So, low acidity beans were not good for my taste even it was Kopi Luwak. On the other hand, Kopi Luwak was great while brewed with pressure.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For roasting the beans, you generally do not need to burn the beans to eliminate the acidity. So, light roasts are OK for Turkish coffee. Majority of commercial brands prepare City roast and the minority prepare American roast (I think). If you taste burnt flavor in a package, it is clearly over roasted; you must be suspicious about the quality of the beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(My personal preference is a bit darker than that. City roast to full city roast.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last words:&lt;/strong&gt; I think, as Turkish coffee is just a brewing method, it is up to the drinkers taste either to add sugar/gum/cinnamon/milk or not, either to use Robusta or Arabica, either to roast light or dark. I mean, if the drinkers find it more delicious, they can boil it up for hours (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%B1rra" rel="nofollow"&gt;It exists!&lt;/a&gt;) before drinking. This is about the taste, so no boundaries. :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are the cheapest options for making good quality espresso at home?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to add espresso to my coffee creations in the morning, but am a novice and don't know where to begin. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It is slightly dependent on your &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; definition of espresso. Also the choice depends on how easy you want its operation to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/06/how-to-use-a-moka-pot-stovetop-espresso-tips.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moka pot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is certainly the cheapest espresso-type device. However, it doesn't fall within the standards of a true Italian espresso, as pointed out in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/298/277"&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, you won't have any crema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wacaco.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand pumps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are inexpensive, compact and light, and have the decent pressure of 8 bars. Although they are marketed as an espresso device for camping, they can be use wherever you have hot water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A step up for home is an &lt;a href="http://www.aerobie.com/product/aeropress/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aeropress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The way it operates is steep + push-filter (as in a French press), and the result ranges from filter-brew-like to espresso-like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next in price are probably &lt;strong&gt;the capsule espresso machines&lt;/strong&gt; (such as Nespresso and its clones), which many supermarket chains have cheap versions of. Very easy to use, but unsustainable (see &lt;a href="https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/2501/2661"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and in the end of &lt;a href="https://www.choice.com.au/food-and-drink/drinks/tea-and-coffee/articles/coffee-capsules" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and coffee enthusiasts won't consider them an option because of the taste (see the previous link). For related concerns, see the (excellent) answer to &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1572/277"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then come two best types: &lt;strong&gt;bean-to-cup&lt;/strong&gt; and traditional &lt;strong&gt;espresso machines&lt;/strong&gt; with a manually operated portafilter. They both are discussed in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/333/277"&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;. Both vary in price and quality significantly; probably a decent traditional machine may have a lower starting price than bean-to-cup machine. You may even find one not much more expensive than a capsule machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as easiness is concerned, capsule and bean-to-cup are obviously easier than moka pots or espresso machines.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does sweet coffee exist?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am looking for a coffee type that is naturally sweet, like sugar snap peas. So there is no need to add sugar, when I drink it.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This question is probably best answered in two directions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel the need to add sugar to your coffee, it may simply be that the coffee that you are drinking is not very good. Sugar makes a lot of things taste better in addition to the sweetness that it adds. There are many ways to improve the quality of your coffee, like buying better and fresher beans, grinding right before brewing instead of buying pre-ground coffee, etc. Whether any of that is feasible depends on your coffee drinking circumstances - e.g., if you need to use your office's drip coffee machine with the coffee bought by the kitchen management, there is not a lot that you can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to add sweetness because you like it sweet, but you still want to avoid adding sugar for some reason, you can try the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of &lt;strong&gt;coffee bean types that have a slightly sweet flavour&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, I have a some "Starbucks 2015 Christmas Blend Espresso" here, which is described by the producer by "Cedar and herbal spiciness with an intense caramelly sweetness". When using the beans in a pump-driven espresso machine, the espresso indeed has some sweetness. &lt;strong&gt;But don't expect too much.&lt;/strong&gt; Coffee is natually low-calorie, which means that there can only be a little bit of sweetness. There are some coffee types that are naturally sweeter than others. According to a book that I have, lightly roasted &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_coffee" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Arabica Bourbon&lt;/a&gt; coffee beans should have a "fine sweetness". Panama Volcan Baru Coffee is also listed as particularly sweet. Against, don't expect too much - "particularly sweet" means in comparison to other beans!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you prefer to drink your coffee with milk, you may want to switch to lactose-free milk. In that type of milk, the lactose has been split into shorter sugar molecules, which makes the milk taste quite sweet without a noticeable change in calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  <title>What factors should I change for a dark roast in an Aeropress?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I normally like a dark roast,  but I'm struggling to get as good a cup from my Aeropress as I do with lighter roasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What factors can I adjust to improve the flavors, compared to how you'd brew a lighter roast?  Less brew time? Colder water? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Dark roasts from an Aeropress easily become too bitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend keeping the water temperature just below boiling. Flip your Aeropress upside down so that you can control the brew time. Add your beans and water, and then brew for 30-45 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With lighter roasts, I do the above but let them brew much longer. I've found you have to adjust the brew time for darker roasts.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does the flavour of coffee beans improve after opening the bag?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;After I open a bag of beans, the flavour of the coffee seems better after the bag has been opened a day or more.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the flavour of coffee beans improve for a period of time after the bag has been opened?  Perhaps I'm imagining it!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;That is almost the opposite of my experience, after opening a bag of beans, they have noticeable less flavour after a couple of days. Coffee beans are more resistant than ground coffee though, as that decays in a couple of hours. Obviously, if beans are exposed to air for long enough, their quality is decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there is an effect that improve them at first, simply because some of the processes from the roasting takes time to finish, and may require several days in order to do so. They may even require exposure to air (oxygen) in order to oxidise some of the compounds causing the flavour. Keep in mind that even though &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the compounds improve, other does not. The most notable degradation in the first days is caused by the most volatile aroma compounds evaporating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph shows the stalling of coffee as a function of time. Note that this is just a visualisation of the aroma compounds evaporating, not necessary a measure of quality. The remaining compounds are also changing, and some of them improves over time.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Adding coffee grounds to a planting medium (e.g. soil) adds &lt;a href="http://homeguides.sfgate.com/plants-shrubs-like-coffee-grounds-45743.html"&gt;fatty acids, essential oils and nutrients that enrich soil&lt;/a&gt; which can help the growth of the plant and it may also affect the &lt;a href="http://forums.gardenweb.com/discussions/1997588/coffee-grounds-as-a-planting-medium"&gt;colour&lt;/a&gt;. One thing to be careful of is that some coffee grounds increase the &lt;a href="http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/soil-fertilizers/diluted-coffee-for-plants.htm"&gt;acidity of the soil&lt;/a&gt;. However, I can't find anything indicating that it will affect the flavour of the plant. So, by all means, grow your plants in coffee grounds, but don't expect any difference in flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Will the quality of the coffee change if I store it in a plastic bottle?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I make my coffee every morning. I leave it to rest for 20-30 minutes, mix it with some milk, and pour it into a plastic bottle. I drink the coffee from that bottle during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I doing it right? Does the quality or the amount of caffeine decrease, if I store it in a plastic bottle?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A short answer is "not significantly", assuming you just store your drink for the day, and there is no sharp changes in storage conditions (strong heat, freeze, etc.)---except warming up the amount you want to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee drinks are unstable, though, and a simple, freshly passed drip coffee tastes different (quality changes) with time. So quality will actually change over a day, although the difference is hard to notice (except people with very acute taste sense).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are also adding milk, which softens the overall taste, so I think noticing changes in the coffee flavour is even harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every vending machine around me (every 100m or so) sells coffee drinks in PET bottles. These bottles are stored for several weeks, and they sell pretty well. They taste fine for that price point and quality, and they are very stable. Of course, they do not include only coffee. They include milk, sugar, and hard-to-spell things. The last category does contain taste stabilizer, etc., so that is unfair comparison. I am just thinking it is interesting to see that coffee in plastic bottles in actually pretty common, especially for relatively short times.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is coffee silver skin?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;A coffee chain states that its paper napkins are made of "coffee silver skin":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oLcvQ.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oLcvQ.jpg" alt="/Users/electreric/Downloads/shot- - 1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explanation on the right says it is "coffee bean skin"---the husk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching the internet about it, I can just find about silver skin in meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there more to know about "coffee silver skin"? For example, I wonder if all or part of the husk is part of it, and also why the term is "silver" (this could be a different question---please comment or ask it yourself).&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Silver skin is the name generally used when it is still on the green beans.  This thin but tough layer is lightly colored (sometimes similarly to the paper product in your question) and mostly translucent.  It allows the green color of the bean underneath to be seen.  After roasting (when it begins to loosen and fall off) it is more properly called chaff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the paper is likely made of chaff collected from the roasting process (easy to collect since nearly all roasters have a mechanism for separation) is actually an excellent reuse of chaff.  "Chaff paper" just doesn't have the same ring since generally chaff is thought to be a byproduct to be discarded.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The silver skin is the innermost layer of the coffee cherry surrounding the pit/seed (green coffee bean).  It is a tough substance to remove and different processing techniques remove varying amounts (dry process coffee removes the least and dry process coffee produces the most chaff when roasting).  Roasting the coffee both dries the silver skin and causes it to split as the coffee bean expands, so it comes off fairly easily during the roasting process given some agitation.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee Grinder vs. Spice Grinder - What's the difference?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between a typical spice grinder and a specialized coffee grinder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there something that specifically affects the quality of the coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify further, I am talking about the electric grinders with a blade, something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tOl9q.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tOl9q.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;(Note: With a general perspective, you may classify coffee as a spice.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine you mention the hand grinders. In that case, the main difference is the size of the canals of the grinders. E.g. in a black pepper grinder, the average diameter of the canals are a bit wider than the average diameter of black peppers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this diameter is far narrower for coffee beans. So, you cannot grind coffee in a pepper grinder effectively as the beans cannot fit in the canals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary: proper grinder for proper spice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Burhan added the image, I think I should make an edition to this answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This grinders are called blade grinders. The main disadvantage of these is the grounds are not homogenously grinded after the process. As the blades randomly cut the beans, some of them may stay intact on the sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burr grinders doesn't have this possibility. All grinded pieces have a maximum volume after the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I can't think of a difference. However, you shouldn't use the same grinder for both. You don't want the aroma of your coffee to be mixed with spices and herbs. :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Nutrition information of roasting coffee in butter oil</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I understand that some Asian coffees, like those from Vietnam and Cambodia, are roasted in butter oil. Does anybody know how much of the saturated fat and cholesterol in the butter is absorbed by the coffee and finds its way into the cup?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;To answer your question, it all depends on what oil is used during the process, which can be found by just flipping the label over. Sugar is also used; it is very similar to searing something on a pan so there is no exact way to measure what % of the ingredients you used will be "absorbed" into the beans. The oil here is used to glaze the beans, which would then mix consistently when ground and brewed. I would refer to this answer similarly asked under &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/17987/how-to-butter-roast-coffee-in-frying-pan"&gt;Cooking-Exchange&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;....The... beans are generally roasted in what is referred to as "butter oil", which may or may not be actual clarified butter oil. Occasionally vegetable oils are used, and historically, traditional "home-grown" coffee roasting style involves creating almost a caramel-like coating effect with the use of a small amount of sugar, oil, and generally a touch of vanilla or cocoa. This coating blackens in the roast and the beans wind up with almost a thin, hard shell. Why is this done? Robusta beans are uniquely slow to ripen on the bush, and often pickers pick unripe beans along with ripe beans. The traditional coating gives all the beans a similar color. The presence of a few unripe beans does not hurt the overall taste effect of the blend. However, modern growers pick only ripe beans despite the extra labor, and do not feature this coating in their roasting, opting simple for a little oil to keep the beans easy to turn in the slow roasting process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vietnamese-coffee.com/vietnamese_coffee_about.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here you will find more information&lt;/a&gt; on how the technique for the beans are roasted.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How does drinking coffee after a heavy meal counteract the drowsiness?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;General knowledge tells you that eating a heavy meal will make you drowsy since blood is being redirected for use in the digestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time coffee does make you more alert because of some chemical effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can the chemical properties of coffee really overcome the need of blood for the brain to be more active? I think that the blood flow is fundamental to avoid feeling drowsy but whenever I drink coffee after a meal I get really alert and almost feel no post-meal drowsiness.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I am by no means a biochemist/physiologist, but I will give this my best scientific go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason people get sleepy after eating large meals, "get the 'itis" as many call it, simply has to do with homeostasis. The average person's diet usually consists mostly of carbohydrates. Carbs, especially when eaten in large quantities, causes a large spike in our blood sugar. In order for your body to bring the sugar levels back down to normal, the body releases insulin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This stimulates movement of tryptophan (an amino acid in the brain), which then leads to the increased production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter responsible for sleep. And this increased level of serotonin triggers sleepiness after a meal. - See more at: &lt;a href="http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dangerously enough, constant spiking and falling of the blood sugar levels in the human body can lead to T2 Diabetes (most associated with processed sugars).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tryphtophan is the same amino that is found abundantly in turkey may be why some people take snoozes after large Thanksgiving day meals!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this brings us to the coffee portion. Coffee has caffeine which is a CNS stimulant. It increases blood pressure, metabolism, causes natriuresis (increase in saline secretion), but most obviously, may cause jitteriness, mild anxiety and alertness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Pharmacodynamics" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This is because when caffeine is consumed, it antagonizes adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not the blood in your body that affects sleepiness/alertness, rather the neurotransmitters and their chemical synapses&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7mcd.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7mcd.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; After eating, your body is naturally producing neurotransmitters to bring your body to a state of homeostasis. When you ingest coffee, which contains caffeine, it counteracts this and keeps you awake and alert.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to methodically pick out coffee nuances</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been roasting coffee for years now at home. I definitely can pick out overall coffee differences (body, acidity, astringency, fruited, etc.) but when I read ratings and notes from my provider (Sweet Marias), I see very specific and distinct note descriptions of flavor that I don't necessarily get. Also coffees being 'sweet' is very subjective to me (I like pourover black but espresso sweetened). By themselves, I do not find most coffees particularly sweet in the way of fruit or sugar or caramel (from lightest to darkest roasts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way I should be preparing my roasted coffees to notice nuances and pick out sweetness?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A well sourced coffee that has been properly roasted and brewed can be amazingly sweet. It's not the same kind of sweetness of cane sugar, but maybe milk is a better example. Milk is not entirely sweet when cold, but as soon as you heat it to around 130F, it's turns deliciously sweet. 
In any event, you will want a lighter roasted coffee. I think it can be a strange transition for people's pallets, especially for people that have been drinking a darker roasted coffee their whole lives, it becomes hard to identify a light coffee with the "coffee taste." A lighter roasted coffee preserves the sugars within the coffee, and brings out the wonderful acids and flavors that come from the fact that coffee is indeed the seed of a fruit. 
I think if I was you, I would purchase some coffee from a specialty coffee roaster (like: verve, ritual, 49 parallel, Intelligencia) and see if one of them really amazes you in any way, and then try and achieve that same roast profile. Other then that, don't always take those taste profiles to heart! They can certainly be different for anyone, and some often pretty silly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As has been mentioned, the species of coffee makes a difference. There are something like a hundred different species, with Robusta and Arabica being the most common commercially grown by far.  Liberica is another species that is grown in small quantities and has a very distinctive taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a single species such as Arabica, there can be a huge number of varietals. Some are naturally occuring (such as Bourbon and Typica). Maragogype ("elephant bean") is also a naturally occuring mutation from Brazil. Others have been bred by research institutes. For example SL-28 and SL-34 are common Kenyan varietals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another famous varietal is the "Gesha" (sometimes romantically but incorrectly called "Geisha"). This came to light when an estate in Pananma "La Esmarelda" noted something interesting when they were cupping their coffee. By separating their harvest, they finally identified a small section which was contributing to the overall cup. This coffee went on to dominate the Cup of Excellence competition and set a world record price at the time. It's since been planted on other farms which brings up the next point.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been mentioned, things like altitude, soil and micro-climate affect the taste. So the Gesha (or any other) varietal from one farm won't taste exactly the same as Gesha from another farm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way of preparing the green beans - washed, dry-processed, or a number of other methods, all have their effect on the final flavour. So even the identical cultivar harvested from the same farm but prepared differently will produce different flavours. (The difference between dry and wet-processed is very signficant.) The actual care taken during preparation is also hugely important - I suspect that if one is starting out with a decent high grown bean, this is what really separates speciality coffee from the mass produced stuff. It takes a lot more care to prep the coffee carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I haven't even mentioned roasting and brewing....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is what makes coffee so interesting - there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; so much variety to try and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I calibrate my Hario grinder?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a hand-held Hario grinder, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PUiTo.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PUiTo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grind is adjusted by twisting a little knob underneath the black upper part. It's very hard to know when you're twisting it how far between the two endpoints you are, since it overturns in both directions, with basically no feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's the best way to calibrate the grind size? I'm brewing with an Aeropress.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Short answer: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slowly. Binary search.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; But for espresso, Turkish, moka, or AeroPress: I adjust mine to nearly the tightest (smallest) setting possible that still allows me to turn the crank without difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This is how I adjust mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approximate the setting by eye.&lt;/strong&gt; Looking at the burrs, gauge about how large you'd like your grounds to be. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark this setting&lt;/strong&gt; (temporarily) with a wax pen or marker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grind a bit of coffee&lt;/strong&gt; and look at the average grind size; &lt;strong&gt;determine whether you'd like it coarser or finer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change the setting&lt;/strong&gt; by N (e.g., 4) steps in one direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeat&lt;/strong&gt;. Grind a bit more coffee. If you went in the correct direction (finer or coarser), determine whether you'd like it finer or coarser. (Start over if you went in the wrong direction)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the setting by going N ÷ 2 (e.g., 2) steps in that direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the grind and check. Terminate if you're happy, or go one step at a time until you are happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MARK THIS SETTING&lt;/strong&gt; AND HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE TO CHANGE IT&lt;/em&gt; ;-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My experience:&lt;/strong&gt; I have a similar Hario model (&lt;a href="http://www.hario.co.uk/coffee/hand-grinder/ceramic-grinder-skerton.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;), which sounds marginally &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; difficult to adjust than the one you're talking about. I use mine for almost all of my daily coffee grinding. I set it very infrequently: I go through phases between pour-over and moka, and I try not to go through these phases more than once per month to avoid adjusting this thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To adjust my model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove top nut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove crank handle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove setting bracket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twist the toothed, threaded washer/nut about the threaded shaft to move the nut up (counter-clock, coarser grind) or down (clock-wise, finer grind).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace bracket, handle, top nut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mark the "set-screw" nut with a marker to remember where I've tried. I try to avoid going more than one revolution either way; on mine, two revolutions goes from moka-fine powder to French-press coarseness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you've figured it out...&lt;/strong&gt; I have put scratch "marks" on the screw for I (moka: fine), II (drip: medium), III (French press: coarse) so that I don't have to guess quite as much. Highly recommend indelible marks on your grinder once you find the setting you like. To change from one setting to the other, adjust to the middle: then go tighter to the "fine" setting, and looser to the "coarse" setting (otherwise, it can be ambiguous).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than changing the settings, I like the thing. There was even a Kickstarter that funded a stabilizing mechanism for the bottom to ensure a more-even grind: it launched as &lt;a href="http://kuissential.com/product/evengrind-coffee-grinder/"&gt;EvenGrind&lt;/a&gt; (I have no affiliation with it).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What Are The Merits of Different Green Coffee Processing Methods?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that there's a distinct lack of Q&amp;amp;A's on green coffee processing methods. As this is one of the earliest steps on the journey from seed to cup, I was curious:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the merits of different green coffee processing methods?&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., impact on characteristics of coffee, labor, time, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words: Why does Farmer A prefer to use the dry process method while Farmer B favors the wet process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processing Methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dry Process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wet Process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semi-Dry Process/Pulped Natural&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dry Process | This is the oldest method of modern processing.  It requires very little equipment.  It is basically a manual process of letting the coffee cherries raisin up, then peeling them.  It is a labor intensive process.  Dry processing tends to produce body heavy, smooth coffees with complex notes.  Dry processing is used extensively in Brazil and accounts for the distinct different flavor profiles from other South American coffees.  Dry processing is not practical in humid, wet, or temperate areas, as dry heat is necessary to dry the fruit in a short enough amount of time and to assure that mold or fungus does not set in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wet Process | This method start with running the cherries through machinery to remove the skin and outer layers of the fruit.  The beans with remaining inner layers of fruit are soaked in water and allowed to ferment.  Additional processing is done  to remove the final inner layers surrounding the bean.  The result is left to dry (usually with additional machine assistance).  Wet processing requires a comparatively large investment in equipment, access to enough water for the process and creates waste water that must also be dealt with.  The process does allow for multiple areas to sort beans (floating during fermentation, in channel after fruit strip, etc) that potentially allow for a more uniform product.  Wet processed coffees tend to be missing the overt fruit notes of a dry process, but this is debatable and can vary based on fermentation methods (additional additives are sometimes used in the fermenting process).  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semi-Dry / Pulped Natural / Wet Hulled / Semi-Washed | This process is similar to the wet process except the fermentation step is skipped and specialized machines are used to strip the final layers from around the bean.  This method can produce beans with the best of both processing methods, but the machines used to strip the inner layers away are also prone to damaging beans.  This is a faster method of processing but again requires machine investment and resource use.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other factors influencing coffee processing that should be kept in mind.  Individual farmers may not have a choice of processing method.  In many places the processing centers for coffee are quite separate from farms and only one processing center may be available.  Local conditions will also largely dictate what methods are appropriate or available.  There are also a myriad of variations on these methods that may produce different results and weather can play a factor as well (think about an area hit by a monsoon while large batches are trying to dry).  At some level, all farmers are trying to get paid for what they produce.  That being the case, most will prefer some combination of whatever local processing method is available and/or cheapest and produces the highest pricing for their product.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How Much Should I Spend When Investing In An At-Home Espresso Machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I remember discussing the merits of different espresso machines a while back at my local coffee shop with a seasoned barista. His advice was that anything priced below $1000 would produce sub-par espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a good rule of thumb? In other words...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the minimum amount of money one should spend when investing in a at-home espresso machine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this question, I'm interested in semi-automatic espresso machines. It would be used to make straight espresso and espresso beverages.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that you should be thinking of your entire espresso budget (i.e. Machine, Grinder, and Accessories) when trying to find the "right" price. If you were to buy a $1000 machine, you'd want to spend minimally $300 on an espresso grinder. If you're looking at spending a $1000 total and go with something that requires a little more technique, maybe the popular Rancilio Silvia / Rocky combination is right for you. Also, some say that the grinder is actually the most important component to consider when trying to make amazing coffee on a budget. It might be worth shorting yourself a bit on the machine to afford yourself a better grinder in the long run. I'd recommend the Baratza Vario as a starting point. It's pricier, but it does a fantastic job for both drip and espresso. Also, Baratza has amazing support/service and a history of quality. That can be worth quite a bit in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Paper Filters for Basket</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for a flat bottom paper filter that fits a basket about 3" on the bottom and 2.5" high. #2 cone filters work, but are really not ideal. The basket belongs to a Cuisinart coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are "basket-shaped" filters, which I think is what you're looking for. In my area, they're just as common as "Melitta-style" cone-shaped filters; you should be able to find them at most markets / grocery-stores. They come in various sizes; you're probably looking for one of the smaller ("junior size") variety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1840"&gt;this previous answer&lt;/a&gt;, here's a picture of what you're looking for, I think: a basket-style filter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIiwu.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIiwu.jpg" alt="basket filter"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also find them online -- &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00KOCTPDC" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;one example of the "junior size" basket filter&lt;/a&gt;, which is what I think you want based on what you said about the size of the machine/filters. There are 3 main sizes (and probably more): "junior size" (for ~2-6 cup machines -- as linked above), the most common normal/medium size (for 8-12 cup machines), and the large/extra-large size (for large/commercial 20+ cup machines).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They tend to be inexpensive and come in large packs... I hope you drink a lot of coffee ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Which books do you recommend to read for people who are interested in coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I would like to ask people's advice on books or nice pieces of articles &lt;em&gt;(of quality comparable to a book)&lt;/em&gt; to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware that the literature is so wide and it may be classified into coffee cultivation, history, brewing, etc. I don't search for a comprehensive list of all books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like people to pinpoint joyful books on coffee. More explicitly, I try to compile &lt;strong&gt;Coffee SE user reviewed and recommended list of books with a possibility of forming a community wiki page in the future&lt;/strong&gt;. So please classify and explain the content of the book and why you recommend that specific book neatly in your answer.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I also agree that "The World Atlas of Coffee" by James Hoffman is a good book.
It covers a lot of things including the history of coffee, growing and production as well as roasting and brewing. A big section of the book is indeed an atlas, showing various countries and where the coffees are grown. Nice maps and plenty of good photo's too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are already very knowledgeable about coffee and have read many other books on the subject , you probably won't get too much extra out of this but it's certainly more than a quick introduction. I think it would be of great interest for somebody who has become interested in coffee and wants to find out more about the whole process from shrub to cup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added another one:
"Coffee - A Celebration of Diversity" by Fulvio Eccardi and Vincenzo Sandali. This was originally published in Italian in 2000 and the English translation became available in 2002, so it's not the most up to date book and I'm not sure whether it's still available but  it is definitely worth grabbing if you can get hold of it. It has beautiful photographs (including some lovely satellite views of coffee growing areas) but is also rich in information. In many ways it overlaps with The World Atlas of Coffee above although it focuses more on the cultivation and production and doesn't have as much on the roasting and brewing. But it's worth getting for the pictures alone.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Large scale cold brewing - Mesh bag technique - What size mesh is best?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm looking to upscale our production of cold brew to batches with a 1000L yield, using a ratio of 1:12.5 to make a ready-to-drink coffee for bottling. Currently we run batches of ~40L through a large stainless 40-micron mesh conical filter with good results, however this won't scale so easily as the mesh is really expensive. I'm thinking that making large batches by steeping coffee in big mesh tea bags will be the easiest upgrade. I'm also assuming that a secondary filtration will be necessary, but that's a separate question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What sort of mesh sizes and materials are best for balancing yield with how fine the filtration is?

  <title>Bulletproof Coffee - Is There A Good Replacement For Grass-Fed Butter?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I tried drinking Bulletproof Coffee with grass-fed butter and Brain Octane Oil, but I really didn't like the buttery, creamy taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions for a replacement for the grass-fed butter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen a few people like to use vanilla bean powder, but I don't know if that has the same effect as grass-fed butter or if it's purely for taste.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have seen folks use coconut oil as a substitute for grass fed butter (or organic butter, or Irish butter or many other variations I have heard).  Almost all of the substitutes I have heard are fat sources designed to get fat based calories into the coffee.  The vanilla bean powder you have heard about adds almost no calories, but will certainly add flavor.  It accomplishes a very different goal than what the Bulletproof folks are espousing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind there are any number of things you can add to coffee to make the caffeine more palatable.  There is an entire industry surrounding this.  What you really need to ask is what you are trying to accomplish by adding something and find the best ingredient for your needs.  Low or no calories flavoring agents maybe suited if you are just not into the taste of coffee.  If you are looking for a fat calorie source, experimenting with different oils until you find one that fits your needs and has a flavor you can deal with may be the way to go.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I look for more protein and not as much fat in my diet.  I like the taste of coffee.  A plain cup of cone coffee and a serving of organic Greek yogurt accomplishes what I am trying to do just fine and doesn't require breaking out or cleaning a blender.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can a cup of coffee explode if heated in microwave?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Hello this is a serious question, and I dont know if I am really in the right part of stack exchange:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine was trying to make a coffee in her lab, she used the microwave to heat the water (I hope you enthusiast do not crucify us for this bewildering savagery). She set the timer to 2.5 min, but then had to run some work. After returning the water had already cooled beyond usability, thus she restarted the heating process for approx. 30s. Before reheating she realized that there was a lot of steam in the microwave cavity. 
After the reheating she takes out the cup, and after having taken it out, the water in the cup &lt;strong&gt;explodes&lt;/strong&gt; in her face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some word on the used hardware:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microwave is an old model from Carrefour home
The cup is an ordinary ceramic cup with shape of a truncated cone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a joke, she did really burn herself and was lucky that she chose her glasses instead of her contacts. However more interesting is, how this explosion came about. There must have been some pressure build up inside the cup but how would such an inhomogeneity in such a small volume be explainable?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As others have stated, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superheating" rel="nofollow"&gt;superheating&lt;/a&gt; can happen in a microwave, especially when using a smooth vessel, e.g. a new, unscratched cup. It is more likely in pure water, but not unheard of from other liquids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you need a hack:&lt;br&gt;
The key to prevent superheating and a subsequent flash of steam when the cup is moved or so is to supply nucleation sites, or, simply put, some rough surfaces or gas bubbles where the water can turn to vapour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many recommend using a teaspoon in your cup, but at least in some microwave models that can lead to "fireworks" of electric sparks. So questionable at best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can get your hand at some lab equipment, get one of those glass sticks with a hollow lower end or a little porous ceramic stone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But probably the simplest way is floating a toothpick in the mug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or use an old, scratched mug, provided it is microwave-safe.&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Best stories of coffee consumption in historical times?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm currently coming up with a coffee article, and suddenly I'm stuck trying to fish my words out of the water -- how has civilization come to appreciate coffee, anyhow? Why did pre-modern societies roast and drink it up, considering the notion that coffee is basically bitter? I mean, if Turkish elites roasted it dark and drank it immediately afterwards, wouldn't that be rather tasteless and overly bitter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did people drink it for the caffeine? Or did they actually like it for its flavor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd just like to hear out some of your insights and the things you've read on coffee's history and coffee in past societies. I'll research on the things you say, and fish some inspiration. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A story often shared as the origin of coffee consumption is that of &lt;em&gt;Kaldi and The Dancing Goats&lt;/em&gt;, which comes out of Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaldi was a herder who discovered his goats would become rambunctious after eating the berries and leaves of a plant. That plant turned out to be the coffee plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon observing this, Kaldi also partook of the plant's berries, finding it gave him extra energy. Some claim people would crush the berries and mix them with animal fat into rudimentary "protein bars".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually they began drying-out the berries and steeping the seeds (beans) in hot water to brew the first coffee to grace the Earth. Thus begins the storied history of coffee consumption!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another anecdote relating to coffee involves Pope Clement VIII. His advisors urged him to ban the consumption of coffee, likening it to the "Devil's brew" as it was popular among Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;, after tasting coffee for the first time, the Pope was so impressed he couldn't bare to think of outlawing it. It's said this led to the spread of coffee drinking among Catholics and Italians in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story should be taken with a grain of salt, as whether or not Pope Clement VIII actually said or did what he said, or whether or not his advisors ever broached the topic is a matter of speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there are many more stories surrounding the spread and popularization of coffee. I'll let others add their own stories, as I know there are &lt;strong&gt;many&lt;/strong&gt; more out there :)&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It looks like a burr grinder, as opposed to a blade grinder. Burr grinders give a more consistent grind size, which is why they're preferred over blade grinders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess is it's made of steel, but it does look tarnished. You might take it apart and polish it to create a smoother grinding surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wood on the inside might be difficult to clean of coffee oils and impart an odor to your freshly ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't tell if the mechanism has a means of changing the grind size. If not, it may in fact be an old spice mill. Otherwise, it won't allow you much variety when grinding your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's given a little TLC I think it would make a nice vintage manual grinder. Compared to blade grinders, even this older grinder ought to do a better job than they ever could. However, if you can't change the grind size than you'll be limited in the type and quality of the coffee you can brew using it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What grind to use for a Phin (Vietnamese Coffee Maker)?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I got a phin at a local vietnamese market, and I will be grinding my own beans. Should the grind be fine or coarse or somewhere in the middle?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;em&gt;phin&lt;/em&gt;, most websites recommend using a grind that you would use for a standard drip machine or a grind that is slightly coarser. Because every &lt;em&gt;phin&lt;/em&gt; is different, it is necessary to experiment with the grind and find the result that fits your tastes best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For someone who cannot drink strong coffee, it is best to err on the side of caution and make their grind slightly coarser and adjust to a finer grind slowly. The best taste profile will be found this way.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What do these large bubbles in my French press indicate?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've seen these bubbles when pressing coffee that I've home roasted in two different presses with two different water sources. I've seen it with coffee from multiple roasts now. The beans are the same in all cases (Rwandan single origin). I am grinding with a burr grinder. Do these large bubbles in the bloom indicate anything about the bean or the roast?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kXwml.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The bubbles are the result of "degassing" — carbon dioxide escaping from the coffee. Degassing will be especially dramatic in the first 24 hours after roasting, during which 40% of the CO2 leaves the bean. See this blog post: &lt;a href="http://fellowproducts.com/understanding-degassing-is-fresh-best/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Understanding Degassing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Roast Profile vs Rest Time, any connection?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:  Is there any science or data to support coffee that has undergone longer roast cycles needing less rest/degas time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some time, I have been doing my own roasting by cranking the machine to max temp, letting it rip, then stopping the roast when I am just short of my desired target and letting it coast to finish in the cool down cycle.  For almost all varietals of beans, my target roast levels end up in the 14:30 to 16:00 minute range for a half pound of green coffee beans.  Recently, however, I have been experimenting with significantly longer roasts (~30% to 50% longer).  I set the machine to max (482F) let it run 12 minutes or so, then crank it down to 425F or so and run to just short of target.  Generally this has been adding 4 to 8 minutes to my roasts times.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious disadvantage is the extra time it takes me to be involved with the roast.  The advantage I was going for was that it is much easier to hit a target roast with such a long window at the "end of roast".  However, I seem to notice another potential advantage.  The coffee seems to taste much better after much shorter rest times.  With my old shorter method coffees came into their peak seemingly around 72 to 96 hours later.  With this new method, the coffee seems to be hitting that same stride at 24 or 48 hours.  This is anecdotally supported by the fact that the air tight jars I keep my beans in are noticeably less "poppy" when I open them to degas the day after roasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of several reasons why this may be a thing, most just involving equations for the behaviors of gasses at various temperatures, but does anyone have a more solid reason why this might be?  Or evidence that's it's all in my head (or taste buds) and just bunk?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This relationship is often discussed on coffee websites that I visit, such as such as &lt;a href="http://www.home-barista.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.home-barista.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greencoffeebuyingclub.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.greencoffeebuyingclub.com&lt;/a&gt;. I have had a similar experience, although my roast times are much shorter than yours (typically 11-12 minutes total). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I roast 3-4 coffees each week. Based on my own taste buds, coffees that are roasted closer to second crack are ready much sooner. I measure the length of time that I roast from the start of first crack. Here are some of the timing / aging notes for my recent roasts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gedeo Worka 2014 -  roasted to 1:45 after 1st crack, ready for drinking after 4 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yirga Cheffe Beriti 2014 - roasted to 2:15 after 1st crack, ready for drinking after 4 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rwanda Abakundakawa 2014 - roasted to 2:15 after 1st crack, ready for drinking after 4 days&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Why does French press not give enough 'Caffeine Effect'?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been drinking drip coffee for several years. It's been perfect for me. It tastes good and most importantly it makes me awake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I started drinking french press coffee and there is something I've missed. I'm no longer experiencing that feeling of explosive energy that I used to have with drip coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the problem with the way the coffee is prepared? I've used different kind of coffees but things aren't getting a lot better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how I prepare it: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I boil some water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put 2 tea spoons of coffee in the french press.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pour the water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the french press.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wait for 4 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;press and pour the coffee into the cup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I like my French Press is because of the caffeine boost. One simple answer to your question is to add more coffee grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But aside from the type and amount of coffee used there are several things that will influence the caffeine level of your coffee. One of them is the size of the ground. You need a ground big enough that it is filtered out but not so big that the water doesn't completely extract the oils and caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might try different grind levels and see which one works best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing you can do is increase steep time. If your grinds are just a bit too large perhaps a 6 minute steep would work better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will have to experiment with the grind and steep time.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Starting a cafe -- simple and gradual ways?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There is some ground-floor space in our building, currently used only at night by a sister-in-law: for her bar. I'd like to learn more about coffee in a hands-on manner, while defraying expenses somewhat by selling it by the cup. My sister-in-law will retire eventually, so there's some possibility of turning the space into a proper cafe. My own goal is more to learn more about good coffee with an eye toward importing and mail-order sales in the longer run, as much as possible in a crop-to-cup style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given my goals, and my starting point, what would be the easiest path? I.e., what equipment and blends should I consider first, what skills to learn, etc. I've never worked as a barista. I have a lot of respect for how complex a business can be even when it seems simple, and I have other business responsibilities, so I'd like to approach this startup problem as gradually and experimentally as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Ah, I was going to make the same point as Travelling Particle - work in a coffee shop - but then you mention that you are in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you will need to find a roaster where you can get fresh roast daily or as needed - hopefully with a business discount. Get a decent grinder and I would go this route for brewing a cup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QdNVp.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QdNVp.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's doesn't get much simpler then this and it looks nice. The Japanese are a people that have a Tea Ceremony and they may appreciate this.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee philosophy: Ice then coffee or coffee then ice</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Ice + 2 Espresso Shots &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OR &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 Espresso Shots + Ice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Settle the score please.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'll give some background, a hypothesis, and (more important) instructions to find out experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experiment is easy and fun. I did experiments such as paper vs. bamboo filter, slightly different grind sizes, fresh beans vs. 7-weeks off roast, and different coffee:water ratios within the range of a scoop measurement (i.e. is it important to weigh the coffee?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lady tasting tea experiment&lt;/a&gt; is at the start of modern statistics and randomized trials. (There's now a book, &lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Lady-Tasting-Tea-Statistics-Revolutionized-ebook/dp/B00633W4A2/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century&lt;/a&gt;.) The question was, “Does it matter to add tea to milk vs. milk to tea?” It turns out the answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation and Hypothesis:&lt;/strong&gt; Adding milk to tea lets significantly more milk get hotter than adding tea to milk does. That could enable more of it to react chemically, e.g. curdling. But that's unlikely with ice, so I'll bet adding ice to hot coffee vs. hot coffee to ice makes no discernable difference in taste. (Let's ignore the fact that dropping ice into hot coffee could splash out more hot coffee than the reverse.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Experiment:&lt;/strong&gt; Do a &lt;a href="http://www.sensorysociety.org/knowledge/sspwiki/pages/triangle%20test.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Triangle Test&lt;/a&gt; with 3 or more people. Make the iced coffee both ways, "A" and "B", keeping all other variables as constant as you can. Each person gets 3 cups, one of which is different than the other two, e.g. a sequence like A-B-A or B-B-A. Give a different random combination to each taster, of course without revealing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All tasters should start by tasting their 3 cups in order. Then they can go back and forth between cups as much as they like. Their job is to try to discern the difference and say which of the 3 cups tastes the most different. You might also ask them to state their preference. When they all make their choices, then you can reveal the combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Math is Not Hard:&lt;/strong&gt; If a taster gets it right, we really don't know if they were lucky or good. The default explanation ("null hypothesis") for the combined test results is that they're within a reasonable range of random results. Dice would randomly get 1/3 of the choices right. If enough people got it right that the odds were &lt;em&gt;small enough&lt;/em&gt; of dice getting a result that extreme or better, then we'll conclude the tasters can discern the difference. Different fields of science may use different thresholds. Pick a threshold before doing the experiment. A common standard for "statistical significance" is ? 5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 3 tasters, if they all get it right, that's a 1/(3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) = 1/27 = 3.7% chance, which beats the 5% threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;K&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; tasters get it right, the calculation considers the number of ways to get &lt;em&gt;K&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; correct choices and the probability of each random choice being correct (1/3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Google Sheets formula for Probability{x ? K of N correct choices} is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=1 - BINOMDIST(K - 1, N, 1/3, TRUE)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so if that value is ? 5%, we'll conclude that people can reliably taste the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; To prepare for an experiment, I make paper strips with the different test sequences. Whoever pours for taster &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; will pick a strip at random, pour those cups while out of view, stash the strip in a pocket, and bring it out after everyone has written down their tasting choices. There needs to be at least enough strips for the number of tasters, and usually a multiple of 6 strips since there are 6 possible sequences. But when there are only 3 tasters, I prune it to 2 sequences that have one A and two B's and 2 sequences that have one B and two A's, so we can't all get the same odd one out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Each taster gets 3 cups of coffee, a spit cup, water, crackers, and a napkin. I put painter's tape on the coffee cups to mark consistent fill lines and to label them 1, 2, and 3.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why is my drip-coffee machine making watery coffee lately?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Lately, coffee from my very basic Mr. Coffee 5-cup drip brewer has been watery tasting, and I am hoping for some troubleshooting help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased of a Cuisinart DBM-8 (a basic automatic grinder) to replace an even more basic blade grinder. This grinder has allows for a grind amounts in increments of "2 coffee cups" starting from 4 cups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My coffee did not become watery upon first use of the DBM-8. I usually brew using 16 to 20 fluid oz of water, and I have switched between the 4-cup and the 6-cup setting on the grinder. I found that the 6-cup setting tasted pretty good, but seemed to use up a lot of beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that said, what has happened for the past week is that coffee made using my brewer has been tasting watery, no matter if I use the 4-cup or the 6-cup grind setting, and whether I try more or less water. I have set the coarseness of the grind to medium, which I believe is appropriate. All I am getting is colored hot water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I inspect the coffee filter and the grounds after brewing with the 6-cup grind, I observe a portion of the coffee grounds appear dry on top, although beneath that, the coffee grounds appear wet. It's as if the hot water is going directly through the filter without soaking enough in the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is my coffee maker broken? I tried cleaning with diluted vinegar, but this did not change things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it the beans? I do switch around, but the beans I buy are in the 10-20$ range per pound. I keep the beans in the closed hopper of the grinder.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Well this is a strange problem but it seems to have to do with the new grinder you are using or the way you use it since the grind is the only variable that has changed (according to your story).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watery coffee most often means that you don't use enough ground coffee. Try using 6g of coffee per 100ml of water for a medium roast. If the roast is very light you may use a slightly higher coffee to water ratio. If it is not the quantity of coffee it is probably the grinder setting. Try a finer grind, something between table salt and sand (probably just the medium-fine setting on your grinder, however do check with your fingers). The problem may be what was suggested in the comments. If the grind is too coarse, the water is just running through the coffee and doesn't leave the time to spread and steep. This is in line with the hole in the center of the coffee bed you are describing. Maybe try to measure the time the coffee needs to run through and see if it changes if you grind finer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this doesn't help then I'd suggest you properly clean the spout and make sure the water is dripping out the way it is supposed to. Maybe scale has built up which is channeling the water, forcing it through the spout in a stream that hits the coffee grounds with too much pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest you try all of the above which will most likely solve your problem. Additionally however you could cut up some standard paper filters and place them on the ground coffee so that it is completely covered. In theory the water should then distribute much more evenly through the grounds. I'd suggest you do this only &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; you have solved the general problem as a means to improve the flavor. It'd definitely be a quite "hacky" solution and I think first of all your machine should work the way it is supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Are there any natural sweeteners that work well with coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am curious about different natural sweetener options that might mix well with coffee. I know about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevia" rel="noreferrer"&gt;stevia&lt;/a&gt; but it gives the coffee a different flavor. Is there anything besides stevia that I'm not aware of? My apologies, I meant natural non-sugar alternatives, I should have specified that.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; options for sweetening are, in my humble opinion, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;actual sugar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or sugar syrups. Options include, in general order from less to more distinct taste...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;table sugar&lt;/strong&gt; (sucrose), including common refined white sugar or less-refined options like evaporated cane juice or turbinado;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;honey&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;agave syrup&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaggery" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;jaggery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or similar minimally-refined sugar;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;malt syrup&lt;/strong&gt;, from e.g., rice or barley;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;maple syrup&lt;/strong&gt; or maple sugar;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;molasses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I personally prefer my coffee black and unsweetened, I've used all of these in coffee. Any sweetener will change the taste slightly. The problem with stevia, for me anyway, is that the bitter notes of stevia are overpowering; I can't consume the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a non-nutritive or lower-calorie alternative, you can look at various &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_alcohol" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;sugar alcohols&lt;/a&gt;, which are (or at least &lt;em&gt;can be&lt;/em&gt;) naturally-produced, lower-calorie variants of sugars. They are produced by various methods, including fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good possibility is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylitol" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;xylitol&lt;/a&gt;, which is somewhat lower in effective calories and nearly as sweet as table sugar with less off-tastes than other sugar alternatives. Another option is erythritol, but may be less-commonly available. World-wide, other options including mannitol, sorbitol, maltitol, and isomalt may be more common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note well: different sugar alcohols may have effects on your digestive system, including bloating and loose stool, especially when consumed in large quantities. Start slowly :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why do I feel lousy, low, out of energy after the high coffee gives?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I started drinking a lot of coffee after coming to college. I became instantly energized and social after grabbing a cup or two. But then at night I became extremely dull, unsocial-able, and quite depressed and completely lack of energy and I crashed into the bed just to wake up late in the mornings. Why is this happening? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Because coffee and other stimulants do not supply "energy" - they cause your body to use its energy reserves a greater or prolonged rate than it normally would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your body does not burn/feed off the caffeine, the caffeine causes your body to burn glycogen/glucose and fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, naturally, once their effects wear off, and your body returns to it's normal state, the energy stores are going to be more depleted than they usually are, and your body will recognize that as feeling run-down afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's to be expected.  If you use more energy and engage in more activity, one should feel more tired afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What makes coffee from a coffee shop/cafe better than the coffee I make at home?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Depending on the coffee shop I go to I often find I like the coffee more than the coffee I make at home or that I have at other peoples homes. Of course cafes and shops have bigger and more fancy looking machines and often their own blends, but what is it that the machines do that home coffee machines can't match?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home I have a Delonghi Dedica machine which  has good reviews for quality coffee and I have used all sort of different coffee blends including ones from coffee shops themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Three things contribute to a good cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coffee itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tools used to prepare the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The skills of the person making the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you're talking about espresso or espresso based drinks (cappuccino) the skill involved is easily developed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you use a burr grinder or a blade to grind your coffee? Or do you use pre-ground coffee? This, believe it or not, makes a huge difference. Coffee shops use a burr grinder to get a consistent grind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without knowing the coffee shops you're referring to (as well as your own brewing habits) it's hard to give a reasoned answer. It may simply be the coffee used and the amount of coffee used.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>History of short and tall sizes</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tall&lt;/em&gt; sizing come from Starbucks or did Starbucks adopt it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my understanding &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tall&lt;/em&gt; are generic terms, but when I left Seattle (and in Seattle when I came back) it seemed there was a stigma against the terms because they were from Starbucks. Did Starbucks introduce these terms, and then other places in Seattle adopted it? Were the terms a part of Seattle coffee culture and Starbucks, as a part of that culture, used it too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Seattle has nothing to do with it—I just know that in Seattle more non-Starbucks places use the same lexicon than elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Short&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tall&lt;/em&gt;, and other sizing names are adopted by Starbucks to denote their own serving sizes. Any use in terms of coffee-serving sizes were coined initially by Starbucks which subsequently led to other coffee shops following suit as an established method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of sizes are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short 8 fl. oz. / 240mL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tall 12 fl. oz. / 350mL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grande (&lt;em&gt;Big&lt;/em&gt; in Italian) 16 fl. oz. / 470mL &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Venti (&lt;em&gt;Twenty&lt;/em&gt; in Italian) 20 fl. oz. / 590mL for hot drink or 24 fl. oz. / 710mL for cold drink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trenta (&lt;em&gt;Thirty&lt;/em&gt; in Italian) 30 fl. oz. / 920mL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see these words are fairly generic but are used in this way as size-naming convention by Starbucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costa also uses a different size-naming convention based off of Italian words.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does a percolator make "better" coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've heard from a friend that she uses a percolator instead of the "regular" brewer. I've never used or drank coffee made from a percolator, is there a difference? Does it make better coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be a subjective question, I don't know. Just want to hear your thought on it.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;First things first, you should decide if it's better than any other brewing method, or not. Decide your cup by tasting and experimenting. (By the way, it's unclear what you mean by "regular brewer" in your question. According to my experience, there's no regular way of brewing coffee.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not a fan of percolators. However, l can add a few objective things on percolators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, you should understand how it brews as a first step. The water in the container boils, gets through ground coffee, drips over the container again. Therefore, you can fine tune brew time. You may brew for a short time for mild coffee or brew longer periods for intense cups. There are nice schemas of how it works in &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_percolator" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final cup is generally dull as most of the volatile flavor has been vaporized during process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As aromatics are vaporized, it smells nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people brew longer with their percolator as they like the strong coffee taste in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may have a burnt taste out of your coffee by over brewing if you are not careful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  <title>Coffee ground too finely - how to deal with it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;We bought a pack of coffee and had it ground on site, like many times before. The new sales girl must have misunderstood something and used a too-fine setting, finest (for espresso) instead of second finest (for my moka).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if I use it, I get many grounds in the top container and basically have to discard about a quarter of the brew each time as its just a grainy sludge at the bottom. Not the end of the world, but rather unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a kind of "hack" how I could still use the perfectly fine coffee?  &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In this case, my usual pre-coffee tiredness solved the problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had planned to mix the espresso grind with my usual grind to minimize the total amount of grounds in the cup. The idea was &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1/2 too-fine grounds -&amp;gt; 1/2 the amount of dregs in the coffee.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being tired, I only remembered this when I had already filled the moka more than half-way with the too-fine grind, so I just topped it up with the other kind and coooked my coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But lo and behold: There were &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; coarse grounds in my pot - just some super-fine ones that weren't noticeable. I have since repeated the experiment a few times and can confirm that a top layer of "just right" grounds seems to be able to hold back most of the too-fine crumbs, especially those responsible for the "gritty" mouthfeel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AsoHY.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AsoHY.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A top layer of 1/4th to 1/3rd of the correct grind proved sufficient as "filter" in my experiments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, there is no excess clogging of the moka, causing the valve to trigger or hot steam/water escaping round the gasket. The pot works just as usual. Of course one may not compact the coffee grounds in the brewing chamber, but that's standard procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How should I clean my burr grinder?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a hand-powered Hario burr grinder. I occasionally rinse out the lower chamber with hot water and a sponge as it gets quite dirty over time. Should I clean the rest of it, and if so, how? I'm assuming the burrs get dirty but I'm hesitant to get them wet.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are two options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get yourself some grinder cleaner (Grindz, Urnex and probably other brands), that you just grind through. You can buy it online. It cleans the burrs, removes oils and other residues. Afterwards you need to grind some beans so that you don't have the cleaner in your cup of joe. This is a rather convenient way to clean your grinder, however definitely more costly and wasteful than the second option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disassemble your grinder according to the instructions provided by Hario and use any kind of brush (toothbrush, pipe cleaner, as long as the bristles are reasonably rigid anything works) to clean the burrs. All the other parts you could also wash with a mild detergent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it, it's easy and should be done once every other month in my opinion. I suggest brushing the burrs and rinsing the rest. It's easy, quick and clean enough.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How does a snack with a coffee slow down the caffeine's effect?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have stumbled upon the following sentence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Have your coffee with a snack to allow a slower release of caffeine into your system.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browsing the internet I could see exactly the same claims, not only in articles, but also in comments and unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is however no reliable evidence or any kind of proof of it. I'm inclined to believe that it works, the question though is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How exactly does a snack slow down the caffeine release?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not sure if it's coffee-specific or a general biological way the things work, so I decided to ask here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's probably due to the fact that your organism has nutriments from the snack to absorb at the same time , if everything mixs in your stomach then absorbtion will also be mixed . It's pretty much the same with alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to get rid of coffee addiction?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I drink 5-8-10 cups of coffee a day prepared on automatic coffee machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem is that I don't have a stimulating effect from coffee. So I usually feel if I must drink coffee or I feel tired If I don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried to get rid of this addiction several times. I can easily stop drinking it for a couple of days (or weeks). First 1-2 days I have a headache and I'm tired; but after that I feel normal. After 2 weeks I tell to myself why not to have 1 coffee, then 2 coffee and very soon I'm again on 5-8 cups a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;:
After one year nothing has changed. I'm still on 5-8 cups of strong coffee. I simply like how it smells, I like how it taste.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;First, the effects you observe are known as caffeine withdrawal and discussed &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3228/why-do-i-feel-lousy-low-out-of-energy-after-the-high-coffee-gives/3229#3229"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is not discussed how to get rid of a coffee addiction. First, you should understand if overcoming this addiction is necessary. I assume, most people who are members of &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Coffee SE&lt;/a&gt; are not likely to think that.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Cold brewing at varying temperatures - How does steeping temperature affect extraction?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've always cold brewed at ambient temperatures (typically in the 68-74F range). I've recently been speaking with people who say that they only cold brew at refrigerated temperatures, stating that it enhances the flavor and smoothness of their final product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question is, is there a scale or ratio that relates TDS to brew time and brew temperature? I know this might not be completely linear because the ratio and grind type will also play into this, but given a consistent ratio and consistent grind, is there a somewhat predictable result?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Brew at 75F for 12 hours yields TDS of 1.75
Brew at 65F for 13 hours yields TDS of 1.75
Brew at 55F for 14 hours yields TDS of 1.75
...
Brew at 35F for 16 hours yields TDS of 1.75
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so what if I told you, that I sell a lot of cold brew at my shop, and have had success with 4-hour steeps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried a bunch of stuff, and I've realized that since the temp is really low (mild to cold), it barely makes a difference in TASTE. The biggest factor is oversteeping (like, 48hours up brew), as it can make your cold brew sour. But as a rule of thumb and for sanity of the production team, I go for cold water and steep for 8-15 hours, depending on the time of day it's made.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does longer brewing time with hot water negatively effect flavor?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been reading the answers to related questions, but I'm still confused about the variable of the length of brewing time. I've heard that when using a Moka pot, one should turn off the flame immediately upon hearing the very first gurgle sound because if it brews a little bit longer (before the pot starts spurting coffee) the resulting liquid coffee can taste more bitter. I've also read that one of the benefits of the Aeropress is that the "brewing" time is so minimal that the coffee tastes better and is "cleaner". If less brewing time=less bitter,then does coffee made with a french press inherently taste more bitter than other methods? (Maybe people that use the french press prefer more bitterness?) I also read a post elsewhere from a person who says she bought a single-cup coffee filter holder with three holes at the bottom rather than the typical one hole, and that the coffee tasted better because the water drained more quickly. Does the faster the coffee passes through a filter make it less bitter? If so, I wonder why the three hole filter holder isn't more sold more frequently. The art of coffee brewing can be so mysterious ;/&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As discussed further in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/14/what-is-the-process-to-reduce-bitterness-in-coffee"&gt;this question about bitterness&lt;/a&gt;, degree of extraction is one significant factor in bitterness in your cup. There are a couple of other links to coffee bitterness in that question also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping other major factors constant (e.g., same temperature of water, same beans), &lt;em&gt;time and grind level&lt;/em&gt; are the easiest to modify to reduce bitterness. That is: &lt;strong&gt;shorter time&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;coarser grind&lt;/strong&gt; will (generally) result in less bitter coffee. While you certainly can't expect to get a reasonable brew from barely chopped beans in 15 seconds, small changes in time and grind level can have a noticeable impact on outcomes, especially for immersion-style brewing methods like French press, Aeropress, pour-over, and to a lesser extent stovetop methods like percolator or moka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifics vary by brewing method. For instance, some bitter-tasting compounds are filtered out by paper filters, so paper-filter pour-over will generally be less bitter than French press, for example. Also, your average paper filter will allow brewed coffee to filter more quickly with a coarser grind (finer grinds will more quickly clog the filter) so you might have to vary your pouring method to keep the total brewing time constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might enjoy trying to vary one parameter at a time: trying coarser- or finer-grind coffee, then with a shorter or longer period of time, in both cases trying to vary only one parameter at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've got a Takeya pitcher with a fine mesh insert that I've been using to cold brew. I fill the mesh with coffee and then as much water as will fit in the pitcher. Typically brew for 24hrs shaking it occasionally.
I like what's Starbucks offers (yeah I know) but I'm finding that mine is coming out much lighter in color and more watered down tasting. I've gone as far as not diluting it after brewing and it still seems light.
Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Did you follow recipe procedures (with all due respect)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;up the amount of coffee to water ratio. Cold brews will use at about double the amount of a hot brew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grind beans for cold brew? I've heard that you can go as fine as drip maker or as coarse as French press. If you feel that the ratio is correct and that you feel that the results are still weak, then you will want a more finer grind - but the suggestion is not to go finer than drip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use an arabica bean. Again with all due respect, cold brews work well to tone down some of the bitterness while retaining the other aromas. This translates to using arabica over a robusta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck and let us know how it turns out? And I actually like the Starbucks cold brews.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there a difference in quality of using a plastic/wood/metal stirrer?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I happen to see in more commercial coffee shops that stirring of coffee for Lattes etc. is done with a metal spoon, however when I order a plain coffee and go add milk/sugar there are plastic stirrers. Similarly when I go and have coffee at work the office has wooden sticks to stir the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides for sanitary reasons, does the type of stirrer used effect the quality of the coffee? Is there an "ideal" stirrer material when preparing coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm just reasoning...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polished gold or porcelain must be the ideal stirrers as they won't chemically react. I opt for porcelain as it may also help keeping the coffee warm as its thermal conductivity is less than gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing the three you mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wooden: Sometimes I taste it. So, I don't prefer it that much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic: There are many polymers we call plastic in our daily life. Some of these things are really of bad quality and I am suspicious if their thermal resistance is adequate for coffee. I wouldn't prefer them, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metal: Especially, if you mention polished 18/10 stainless steel cutlery, they probably resist the heat and won't react with anything. So, the only bad thing about them is, they may make your cup colder a bit quicker than usual. Just take the spoon off right after use. This would be my preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Should I press the coffee tight?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;This is about dripping coffee maker. I used to just dump grounded coffee on top of the filter, but recently I started pressing the grounded coffee tight. My thought was that, this way, it would be harder for the water to drip through, and potentially stay contact with the grounded coffee for a longer period, hoping the coffee would be stronger this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else do this? Does this make sense? Is there any reference of some sort of experiment proves either? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;What you're talking about is commonly referred to as "tamping". This is generally only used in making espresso, and is not recommended for any other brew method that I know of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are correct in assuming that the tamping will increase brew times and therefore the coffee will be in contact with the water for longer. This of course produces a stronger coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is not the "correct" way to increase the strength of coffee. The generally accepted way of doing this is changing the brew ratio. The brew ratio is the ratio of grounds to water, typically denoted in grams. The ratios range greatly depending on type of brewing. Tamping the coffee will also affect the flavour of the coffee, because one part of water will extract from one part of grounds longer, producing an undesirable taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want stronger coffee, simply add more grounds to your filter basket. This way your water is not in contact with the grounds for too long, but rather extracts from more grounds. The flavour will be noticeably better through this method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is just stainless steel housing and a wooden layer over it to protect your hands from the heat, or just a double walled stainless steel housing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plunger is the biggest issue since that's what provides the seal and ability to move the piston down. Is there any reason why cork wouldn't work for this? Wine bottles use corks to preserve freshness seems like a cork seal should be able to hold up for 30 seconds just fine under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

Especially in the world of coffee, where brewing methods are identified by &lt;em&gt;brands&lt;/em&gt;, it is hard to not talk about specific products. Therefore, I'll try to answer as best I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's talk about some of your suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ideally, double-walled tempered glass housing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the appeal of an Aeropress is that is durable, fool-proof, and easily brought on camping trips or stored in drawers and backpacks. Along with being bulky, doubled-walled glass or stainless steel would add weight and fragility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;fine stainless steel filter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is definitely an option, and you can buy metal filters for a few popular brew methods including Chemex and Aeropress, and off course, french press is typically a metal mesh filter. The thing about metal filters compared to cloth or paper is that even the finest ones cannot filter at the same level. Metal filters will always let in more oils and fines compared to paper, and this is why the might not be desirable for an Aeropress, where clean, bright coffee is expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is there any reason why cork wouldn't work for this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cork does seal well under the right conditions. But that's the key: right conditions. In a wine bottle, there is 1/2 and inch to 3/4 of an inch in diameter, and the cork is typically more than an inch long. It has also been created, molded, and formulated specifically for that task. A cork plunger would need to be thicker and be made specifically for that application to work, because you would't want it to flex and break the seal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, cork is terrible at remaining taste-neutral. Every cup of coffee you brewed would impart taste into the cork and negatively effect every other cup. You could prevent this by putting a layer of something on the bottom if the cork, but then you start looking at using plastics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for brewing methods similar to the Aeropress, I might suggest something like the &lt;a href="http://www.rokkitchentools.com/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;ROK&lt;/a&gt;. It uses hand pressure to extract espresso. No, i is not as easily carried around like an Aeropress but has a similar function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for brewers that have no plastic, well, there are many options in that field too such as french press, Chemex, mocha pot, espresso machine etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, you could try modifying a glass french press with some sort of cloth filter to create a sort of reverse Aeropress. You can try looking around other options online too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps to answer your question!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Re-using spent coffee grounds?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have an Osaka stainless steel pour-over &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nX69F.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nX69F.jpg" alt="like this one"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I brew a single cup of coffee (around 12 oz), is it possible to brew another cup with the used grounds by putting the cone dripper back over my mug and pouring more water through it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure this would be the same as using more water and brewing over a carafe to brew twice as much coffee, except I would be doing it later rather than all at once (if that makes sense).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is possible, what's the maximum amount of time I can wait before brewing my 2nd cup?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are a few elements to this answer, so I'll try to tackle them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;is it possible to brew another cup with the used grounds...?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. It is physically possible to do this. Just do what you described and voila, more liquid into the next mug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;this would be the same as using more water and brewing over a carafe to brew twice as much coffee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where you are wrong. Brewing coffee is chemistry, whether you are using a Chemex or an espresso machine or a cheap drip machine. Each stage of brewing produces different flavours from the coffee. I can't guarantee this is accurate but here is an example of what I'm talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of your pour controls the bitterness of the coffee. The bloom helps to get rid of CO2 and dissolves oils on the beans and in the grounds. It will develop your "body".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of your pour will determine the sweetness. Some people swear by small pours over a longer period of time, while others prefer the ease of just slowly filling the brewer evenly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the last half of your pour controls the intensity of your cup. This is where your question comes in. More water in this last section will produce a weaker cup, and less water a stronger one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these parts of the pour need to be melded together to create a delicious cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pouring your first cup then re-using the grounds for the second one means the second cup misses out of the main part of the brew. Yes, the liquid will tastes like coffee, but will not have very much caffeine, and will lack the flavours present in a well-brewed cup. You're basically making ultra-weak, bland coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to make more coffee and don't care about the strength, brew a larger batch into one carafe, then swirl and split it between tow cups. You should adjust your grounds-to-water ratio accordingly though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you answer your question!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>French Press: Does "plunge speed" affect taste?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Recently at the office a fellow co-worker of mine got a french press. I see that he slowly plunges the grinds down to the bottom as the roast brews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this really affect the flavor of the coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Plunging speed will only change the flavour in a minor way. Plunging slowly/carefully will prevent more sediment from getting through the filter as you push it down. Change in amount of sediment in your cup will change the mouth feel of your coffee, and may influence the flavour a little bit. I.e.: If there is too much sediment it may be more bitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found I do not even need to plunge at all when making French Press, I have started simply carefully pouring the coffee out through the filter without plunging. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>When to add alcohol for Irish coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When making an Irish coffee, is there a difference when you add the alcohol, before or after the cream? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I think it would make a difference is because the heat would make lots of the alcohol evaporate. So by adding it after the cream you actually get more alcohol in your coffee (and more alcohol soluble flavors). &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;An Irish coffee is traditionally a strong sweetened (with muscovada or demerara sugar or syrup) coffee with a doubleshot of Whisky (I guess around 40-50ml for a glass of coffee of 150ml) and a layer of aerated cream on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know what was used traditionally, I assume some kind of turkish coffee (or "Cowboy coffee"), where the grounds steep in water just of the boil for a few minutes or percolater coffee. Today I would probably use french press coffee or AeroPress with a metal disk instead of paper filter. You should keep in mind, that the coffee-sugar-whisky mix has to be higher in density than the slightly whipped cream. A pour over is likely too delicate (in taste and density). You also don't want coffee that's too strong (like espresso) because it would cover up most of the Whisky taste. Irish whisky tends to be lighter than Scotch or Bourbon. Add brown sugar to taste, but keep in mind that it is used to increase the density of the coffee-whisky mix as well, so one tablespoon should be added (for a glass of coffee as defined before).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whiskey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well it's called Irish coffee, so I would use Irish whisky. However I'm sure it's worth experimenting with different whiskys, trying to fit them to the flavor profile of the coffee. If you have a very nutty, chocolaty Brazilian coffee, maybe a smoky, spicy Bourbon fits better. I don't know much about whisky though. I'd just try different things. If you are afraid of too much alcohol evaporating, you could just wait until the coffee is cooled down to below 79°C. You can't drink it before that anyways, it would be too hot. After brewing, add sugar to cool it down, then I would wait until it's somewhere around 75°C, add the whisky, which will cool it down even further. Guessing to just below 70°C. Add cream and drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said before, the cream should float on top without mixing with the coffee. Thus it has to be added after, which is usually done over the back of a spoon. It should be whipped lightly, but not too much either. You want it to be of a creamy, slightly aerated consistency. You drink the coffee through the cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/food-and-drink/how-to-make-the-perfect-irish-coffee-1.2912857" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here is a link&lt;/a&gt; to a recipe similar to what I wrote, although theirs has some twists like nutmeg in it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is Navy coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My interest has led me to discover '&lt;code&gt;Navy coffee&lt;/code&gt;'. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to learn more since I do not know if this refers to a specific technique of coffee making or to a blend that is considered exclusive or historic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read from a website &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"it has a trace of salt so you won’t get dehydrated" &lt;a href="http://thedossiers.net/navy-coffee/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;¹&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What research supports this? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Navy coffee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one really knows for sure. Some naval vessels used to put salt in the coffee either to kill the bitterness (or to help stay hydrated), but it was neither a universal or permanent practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;William Ewing, QM1(SW) USN (ret), Quartermaster E-6&lt;/strong&gt; has this to about the subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When navy coffee was 50% chicory, 50% cheap coffee (most of my career), it was a dying practice, based on previous coffee that was very bitter. Nowadays, the 50% chicory formula is not bitter enough to require that, and many ships get Starbucks, which they then mix with the chicory coffee to smooth the taste even more.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Now, for a while, Denny's had some bad coffee, and for over a year, my friends and I added salt to kill the bitterness and extra sugar to overpower the salt. Then Denny's switched blends to one not as awful, so we could drink it without salt. - &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-Navy-people-put-salt-into-their-coffee" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Do Navy people put salt into their coffee?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other sources say the complete opposite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I had to make many, many pots of coffee as a mess crank (one who spends their first 90 days or so working on the mess decks. Think of it as KP for 90 days straight).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;We used a large commercial drip coffeepot and coffee, period. No salt was added, at least I never added any. That it is strong comes from the fact that the Navy has no contracts with suppliers that have decent coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It is possible that the salty taste does come from the fact that shipboard water is naturally salty. When a ship is in port, she's hooked up to local water. IIRC, ships at sea have a special desalinization process that isn't perfect, but it comes fairly close. - &lt;a href="https://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-91446.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;How the Real Men in the Navy Make Their Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a number of years, I used to put salt in the grounds to help remove the bitterness of the coffee. Please not that this was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; navy coffee and I was making a 100 cups at a time. No one ever complained, but that might have been to sure dumb luck too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Urban Possum has this to say about &lt;a href="http://theurbanpossum.blogspot.com/2004/11/navy-coffee.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Navy Coffee&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use an economy-brand coffee. Mother Parker's, for example, or Chase &amp;amp; Sanborn. If you have to talk in terms of roasts, these brands are a light to medium--perfectly acceptable to a majority of people. Their virtue is that they're cheap--hey, it's Navy coffee. We're talking government suppliers here.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use 2 level tablespoons for each 8-ounce cup. The standard measure for coffee is 1 level tablespoon for a 6-ounce cup. The power of Navy Coffee does not derive from the strength of the roast, but from the amount of coffee used, so as you can see, this one is stronger than most. Some old chiefs like the coffee so strong that it actually seems chewy (that comes from the tannins in the coffee and their effects on the tooth surface), but we don't need to go quite that far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt the grounds before you begin brewing. Salt, as in ordinary table salt. The measurement is a pinch, which is about 1/8th to a maximum of 1/4 teaspoon per 5 cups brewed. This is the secret to True Navy coffee: the salt will cut the initial bitterness of the coffee, but takes nothing away from the aroma. Don't worry too much about the taste, Navy coffee won't taste salty unless you use too much of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, the navy often employs the term a &lt;a href="https://www.rogersfamilyco.com/index.php/the-origins-of-a-cup-of-joe/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cup of Joe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to their Navy Coffee. Where this tradition first came into use is unknown but some believe it was due to the Secretary of the US Navy, Admiral Josephus “Joe” Daniels who abolished wine (or alcohol) on Navy ships in 1914.  Thus, coffee (the next best thing) was the beverage of choice for the sailors.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much does caffeine concentration in a cup of coffee decrease as a function of time (roughly)?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;For example, if I let a cup of coffee sit for 1-2 hours, would the amount of caffeine I get mostly be the same? Or does it decrease?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is quite stable, it doesn’t evaporate or break down at room temperature (or coffee temperature), apart from dissolving in the water used to brew your coffee. So after an hour or two, the caffeine content is the same&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; as right after brewing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the same is not true for some of the other substances that have us appreciate coffee, so you may expect the flavor to deteriorate a bit (or a lot, depending on whether you started with a handful of freshly ground slow-roasted beans or a few spoonfuls of Folger’s coffee-flavored sawdust). But that’s not what you were asking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;———-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; If we were &lt;em&gt;really nitpicking&lt;/em&gt;, we could even say that the caffeine &lt;em&gt;ratio&lt;/em&gt; (not content) increases due to a minute bit of water evaporating during the given time frame. But for the average household precision, “stays the same” is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Caffeine content of different brewing methods</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;For a given type of bean, do different brewing processes and temperatures (drip, French press, Mocha, espresso, cold brew, etc.) produce coffee with different caffeine content?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would seem temperature isn't a factor because, according to &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/277/8287"&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;, "caffeine is chemically stable even when passed through its boiling point (evaporation temperature) of 312°C (593.6°F)".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brewing method, however, would seem to matter. Mocha, espresso machines would seem to extract the most caffeine because they require finer grounds and use higher temperatures (steam) and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Short answer: No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly longer answer: The temperature, pressure and method of brewing barely impact the amount of caffeine extracted from the bean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because caffeine dissolves so readily in hot water, the single most important factor in determining the amount of caffeine in the cup is the amount of coffee used to prepare said cup. Arabica beans contain about 0.8-1.4% of caffeine by weight, depending on the variety. So if you were to brew an espresso (15g in 30g out) or a pour over (15g in 250g out), you would have the same amount of caffeine in each beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Slow Roasting Coffee Beans</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Conventional Coffee bean roasts at around 200-240C at around 11-19mins to ensure Maillard reaction in the beans to create the familiar taste of coffee we all know today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could we instead roast the coffee at around 160C where Maillard reaction and caramelization happens, however over longer periods of time say 35-50mins to ensure even browning throughout the beans and also develop a &amp;quot;cleaner/clearer&amp;quot; uniform taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any desirable effects or flavor profile that it will miss out due to the lower temperature?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have had no success at low temperature roasting, I have gone through a number of hacked popcorn popper coffee roasters. This requires some tweaking to get the temperature high enough to get a good roast. As a result, I have wasted a few pounds of beans on “low’n’slow” roasts. If you leave the beans in long enough, they will turn dark. But they never develop robust coffee flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A green bean has no flavor. Lots of caffeine, but no flavor. It is the roasting process which converts bean constituents into yummy coffee-flavored chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maillard Reaction is a specific reaction between amino acids (building blocks of protein) and reducing sugars. It produces specific chemicals like 3-deoxyhexosulose. These products do not provide coffee flavors. Which is good because otherwise your bread and French fries would taste like coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you roast beans at Maillard temperatures, you will have brown beans that taste like dark toast. But we don’t drink coffee because it tastes like toast. We drink it because it tastes like coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have given up on popcorn popper roasters. They don’t stand up to proper coffee roasting temperatures. I have switched to a BBQ rotisserie basket. With an eye on the thermometer, it does a very good job and leaves the stinky smoke outside.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Troubleshooting Moka coffee grind size vs sediments</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently received as a gift a pack of pre-ground coffee that was supposed to be incredible, but I just can't get it to work. I'm still getting used to my Moka pot, so its normal that I don't get a new coffee right in the first try, but this one is proving a challenge. No matter what I do, it ends up over-extracted (quite bitter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first suspicion is the grind, it doesn't look consistently sized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cpCDc.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cpCDc.png" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not certain, but I think this grind is the main culprit of a lot of coffee sediment going through:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lxssQ.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lxssQ.png" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6hGsr.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6hGsr.png" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm somewhat used to seeing a bit of sediment in my Moka coffee, but this is an outlier and I'm betting it is related to the bitterness. After trying different flame sizes (i.e. temperatures) and different amounts of water and seeing no change, I'm wondering if there's something else I should do, or some specific temperature/water level/method I should try - like interrupting the extraction midway with cold water as I've seen some people recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the extraction process is sputtering quite a bit, the coffee goes out on high pressure from the start. Maybe despite most of the coffee being quite coarse, it's still clogging the filter with the smaller particles? I'm definitely not tampering, don't even fill all the way through (like 90% filled).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is my analysis correct and the grind is the biggest problem, or is there something else I should experiment with my Moka pot that may work? Should I reserve this coffee for some other method like pouring over, or just give up?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A Moka grind is a tad coarser than espresso grind and ideally finer than standard pour over. If it’s too fine, you’ll see the &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3356/coffee-ground-too-finely-how-to-deal-with-it"&gt;excessive sediments&lt;/a&gt; or - worst case - even clogging up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the largest particles in your first picture are French press or even cold-brew worthy: I can see the curved, smooth outside of the beans. If you &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; get sediments, it means you have a very inhomogeneous grind, I would suspect a blade grinder instead of a burr grinder was used.
See that section of your first photo, with the extremes circled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Xz4D.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Xz4D.jpg" alt="inconsistency" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the difference in particle size, you will always get over extracted and under extracted coffee j the same cup, independent of brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your last picture shows a rather watery, thin coffee over the sediments, I would expect coffee from a Moka to be more opaque and possibly darker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fix, you could try sifting the coffee to separate the various sizes a bit, but frankly, I never was particularly successful with that. Apart from that, I’d first try the batch in a pour-over setup and if that doesn’t work (e.g. clogging up the filter), move up to French press.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>homemade cleaner for basic drip coffee maker</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to create a cleaning agent to use on a basic drip coffee maker using household items? If so, what ingredients are needed and in what ratios? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am mostly concerned with cleaning the insides that I believe are made from plastic. The carafe I can clean separately. I know that there are products on the market, but I am interested in homemade solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Ordinary white vinegar works just fine, but the smell bothers some people. If so, use citric acid. You can either pick some up at your local grocer, or &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B008AYJ3HY" rel="noreferrer"&gt;order it by the pound&lt;/a&gt;.

  <title>Upward size limit for espresso makers</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In my, somewhat limited, experience with espresso machines they generally only produce a few shots of espresso per load. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a technical limitation of espresso making or is it just that the manufactures expect normal, healthy, people to only drink a shot or two at a time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it another way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there machines out there that are capable of producing a pot of espresso or does the process require small batches?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The key here is &lt;em&gt;extraction&lt;/em&gt; from the espresso coffee. Only so much desirable flavor and body can be pulled from a puck of coffee. So, then you might say, why not make the puck bigger? Well then that would force the water through a thicker puck, causing the extraction to be slower and longer, giving bitter flavors. The amount of pressure needed to make a desirable "pot of espresso" with a larger "puck" (or probably more accurately, a "slab" in this case) would be a wild safety hazard, since the pressure would be too immense for any cost-effective equipment to handle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is it a technical limitation? Yes and no. I think it has more to do with being a tried process that gives repeatable, scientific results. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Are high-end cone grinders adjustable?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I switched from a modestly priced blade grinder to a moderately priced cone grinder because the results were inconsistent  (some very fine powder and some only fragmented beans mixed with usable grounds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I have more consistency and control if I switch to a high-end cone grinder? I'm thinking about a refurbished restaurant grade grinder, not an industrial grade machine as one might find at a Starbucks or boutique roaster.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes, high end grinders are generally adjustable. Some even have macro and micro adjustments. For example the &lt;a href="https://www.baratza.com/flat-burr-grinders/vario-grinder/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Baratza Vario grinder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hand grinders are also adjustable, and provide a good grind. See the &lt;a href="http://www.hario.jp/coffee/grinder.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hario range&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The larger commercial grinders are sometimes aimed more at bulk output than at a precise and consistent grind. They grind the coffee very quickly, which may not be the quality you are looking for. Some people prefer grinders that operate at a lower speed so that the temperature of the burrs stays low, reducing the chance of the grind getting over roasted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gearpatrol.com/2013/02/25/grind-it-out-10-best-coffee-grinders/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here's a list&lt;/a&gt; of mid to high end grinders. You will notice that they all have adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often see coffees labeled with marketing materials such as "contains only beans grown above x thousand feet." Does the altitude at which the beans are grown actually affect the final flavor of the coffee? If so, what are the mechanisms which cause this, and what does it do to the actual flavor of the final product?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Based on the study entitled &lt;strong&gt;Effects of Altitude, Shade, Yield and Fertilization on Coffee Quality (Coffea arabica L. var. Caturra) produced in Agroforestry
Systems of the Northern Central Zones of Nicaragua&lt;/strong&gt; the summary describes following on the altitude subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Altitude had the strongest influence on coffee physical
  characteristics, biochemical composition and organoleptic quality.
  Shade influenced significantly the physical characteristics and
  biochemical composition of coffee beans; nonetheless, the organoleptic
  quality was significantly enhanced by shade only in the altitudinal
  range of 950-1255 m. Fertilization and yield influenced positively
  physical characteristics of the coffee beans as well as their
  biochemical composition. The organoleptic quality was influenced by
  fertilization, but not by yield. Biochemical compounds showed strong
  relationships with organoleptic characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Amount of milk in a macchiato beverage</title>

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The Italian word &lt;em&gt;macchiato&lt;/em&gt; literally means "marked" or "stained" (related to the word "immaculate" [&lt;a href="http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=immaculate&amp;amp;allowed_in_frame=0"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]), so really it is an indication to add a small quantity of the "staining" liquid, be it espresso or milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;caffe macchiato&lt;/em&gt; (also called &lt;em&gt;espresso macchiato&lt;/em&gt;) is a shot of espresso (or two) with a "stain" of steamed milk and sometimes a little foam to indicate there is milk hiding under the espresso's &lt;em&gt;crema&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;latte macchiato&lt;/em&gt; is the opposite concept, where steamed milk is "stained" by a shot of espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The Keurig 2.0 machine is looking for an element (perhaps magnetic?) that is embedded in the authorized pods. The site &lt;a href="http://www.keurighack.com/"&gt;KeurigHack.com&lt;/a&gt; contains a video that shows a simple technique for bypassing this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically you need one lid from an authorized pod that you can place on top of your pods so that the Keurig 2.0 accepts these pods. The video goes on to show that it's fairly easy to make this a permanent change just by applying some tape to your authorized lid so that it sticks to the roof of the pod enclosure. The following screenshots were taken from the video. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>When making a long black, how long should hot water cool before adding espresso before combining?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;A long black is made by pouring espresso into hot water-- effectively the reverse of an americano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there an ideal amount of time, or an ideal temperature, at which the hot water should be allowed to cool to avoid burning the espresso during the combination process?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As an American, I've never heard of a long black, but it sounds like a great idea. I normally drink brewed coffee black, but I enjoy an occasional Americano. The only problem is that they're generally served around 400,000° and I can barely hold them and have to wait hours for them to cool down enough to drink. Sometimes I ask for ice or something to cool it quickly. If I just wait for it to cool, it tends to taste rather old and stale by the time I can handle it. Or maybe I just can't taste it because my tongue is crispy from preliminary attempts. But the crema and freshness is always long gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that must secretly be the real reason for a long black—by adding the espresso to the top of drinkable-temperature water, you still have a chance at the best flavors and aromas. As &lt;a href="http://www.fivesenses.com.au/blog/2011/12/19/the-espresso-menu-explained" rel="nofollow"&gt;the Australian coffee roasters Five Senses put it,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the crema, the long black tastes best as it cools slightly from boiling to a drinkable temperature. Only then will you be able to perceive some of the finer nuances and sweetness of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I would shoot to &lt;strong&gt;have the cup around the same temperature as good brewed coffee by the time it hits the drinker's lips&lt;/strong&gt;. According to &lt;a href="http://www.coffeedetective.com/what-is-the-correct-temperature-for-serving-coffee.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Coffee Detective,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[American-style brewed] coffee is best served at a temperature between 155ºF and 175ºF (70ºC to 80ºC). Most people prefer it towards the higher end, at about 175ºF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means, depending on cup type and ambient temperature, if you draw 200°F hot water from the machine before you start making the espresso and leave it uncovered, it will be roughly the right temperature to serve by the time the shots are ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon my return, what parts should I replace?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you live in a hard water area then clean using a citric acid solution and make sure that the pumps are then empty of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could if it's easy remove the gasket seal (if there is one) which sits on the metal fine filter where the coffee is pumped through, this is to avoid any residue drying and gunk/mould forming on the seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may depend on your model how easy access some of this. If you have a bean to cup then you'll need to clean the waste bin and empty the bean hopper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally store it in the original box, somewhere that isn't humid and you should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you fire it up again, you'll need to pump water fully through (again you could use a citric acid solution) and restore the gasket seals. I can't think of anything else you could do.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it necessary to keep a portafilter in the grouphead when not in use?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Some say that keeping a portafilter in the grouphead is both beneficial for the machine &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; affects the quality of the espresso (by keeping the portafilter warm).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this accurate? If so, what are the benefits of doing so?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Keeping the portafilter warm (and receiving / tamping a dose within a warm portafilter) is supposed to result in additional oils being released in the extraction, which in theory leads to a fuller pull and more crema. It's also supposed to add to the benefits of pre-infusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have experimented at length with this, and &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/137/does-pre-heating-a-puck-on-the-group-head-produce-more-crema"&gt;can detect positively no difference between a shot extracted from a cold filter, and one extracted from a warmed one&lt;/a&gt;. It might only be noticeable on higher-end (larger) machines, or simply larger filters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, it's a sound enough practice as it would help keep the group head and portafilter from warping independently, even ever so slightly. Even though the seal they make is assisted by the inclined plane the filter travles to reach the head, it's still good for the filter to mate properly with the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked my barista about this after Joel mentioned it, and he also said it's a good practice to keep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr; It can't hurt, and it might help, but YMMV on lesser machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiments in various presses, and the amount of crema they produce have shown that pre-warming &lt;em&gt;metal&lt;/em&gt; filters produces more crema. This eluded me because I own a pretty good machine that heats the filter quickly after it has been attached to the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accuracy would depend on your machine. The result &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be more crema, and everything that a fuller extraction entails. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;suggestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it on your machine and see if it makes a detectable difference.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the appropriate climate for a coffee plant?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In the tropics I know that coffee requires some elevation, but increasingly coffee is being grown in the subtropics.  What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for growing coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://www.coffeeresearch.org/agriculture/environment.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt; which prescribes the following subtropic and equatorial growing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The subtropical regions, at high altitudes of 16-24° (Illy, 21). 
  Rainy and dry seasons must be well defined, and altitude must be
  between 1800-3600 feet.  These conditions result in one coffee growing
  season and one maturation season, usually in the coldest part of
  autumn.  Mexico, Jamaica, the S. Paulo and Minas Gerais regions in
  Brazil, and Zimbabwe are examples of areas with these climate
  conditions (Illy, 21).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The equatorial regions at latitudes lower than 10° and altitudes of
  3600-6300 feet (Illy, 21).  Frequent rainfall causes almost continuous
  flowering, which results in two coffee harvesting seasons.  The period
  of highest rainfall determines the main harvesting period, while the
  period of least rainfall determines the second harvest season. Because
  rainfall is too frequent for patio drying to occur,  artificial drying
  with mechanical dryers is performed in this type of coffee growing
  environment. Examples of countries that have this climate are Kenya,
  Colombia, and Ethiopia (Illy, 21).&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;Excuse the rookie question, but I am a newbie to coffee. (I blame my nationality; I grew up with tea. ;) )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What equipment, exactly, do I need to get from coffee beans to a cup of espresso that I can drink? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Easiest thing is a bean to cup machine like any of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/b?node=368204031"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;, these will grind a pre-measured amount of beans, heat water and pump through into your cup and dispense the used grounds into a grounds bin internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going the other way you need a minimum of some form of grinder (preferably burr type) which can be manual or electric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 'normal' espresso machine like &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Espresso-Cappuccino-Machines-Home/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=10706951"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; which may or may not have a milk frother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can opt for a digital scale machine to weigh your beans, possibly mineral water if you hate descaling your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scales are for measuring an accurate amount of beans, I do this because I have a manual grinder. The water is cheap still mineral water because I live in the south of England and the water is so incredibly hard that it has tattoos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also you need cups to drink the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are the traits of a well made Cappuccino?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;How can you check if a Cappuccino coffee was prepared correctly? What specific traits will a properly prepared Cappuccino display that poorly made Cappuccino's will not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've heard that when you it stands still upside down (with perfectly steamed milk and froth is insanely heavenly), then it's perfect. Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;My take on this is to focus on the mechanics and preparation, which I think is an important part (though perhaps not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;) of a cappuccino being properly made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappuccino#Preparation" rel="nofollow"&gt;cappuccino&lt;/a&gt; consists of espresso and steamed milk (see distinction from a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte" rel="nofollow"&gt;latte&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Barista_Championship" rel="nofollow"&gt;World Barista Championship&lt;/a&gt; specifies the proper construction in their &lt;a href="http://www.worldbaristachampionship.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2015-WBC-FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;beverage definitions (.PDF)&lt;/a&gt; in §2.2.2. It consists of a single-shot of espresso (25 mL / ~0.8 fl. oz.), textured (steamed) milk, and &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 1 cm of foam (other places suggest 2 cm). Total volume is 150-180 mL / 5-6 fl. oz.  To the extent that you subscribe to the WBC being a benchmark, the &lt;strong&gt;components&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;volume&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;amount of foam&lt;/strong&gt; define physical properties of a properly made cappuccino. It also states that the components should be in "harmonious balance."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WBC states that aspects of the service are also crucial, such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;visual appearance&lt;/strong&gt;, such as that the beverage should fill the cup;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;served with accoutrements&lt;/strong&gt;, such as "spoon, napkin and unflavoured water";&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;logistical aspects&lt;/strong&gt; of drinking, such as temperature and holding the cup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, there's a lot of variability that might lean closer to personal preference. Some other topics mentioned at WBC and Wikipedia include being "wet" (referring to the foam, versus "dry"), and "traditional" (solid central circle of white foam, versus having &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte_art" rel="nofollow"&gt;latte art&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other recipes for cappuccino at home vary greatly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.folgerscoffee.com/coffee-how-to/how-to-videos/cappuccino" rel="nofollow"&gt;Folgers suggests&lt;/a&gt; to use equal parts of coffee (French press or drip), steamed milk, and foam. You'll get a rather different outcome from using coffee instead of espresso.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/en/coffee/how-prepare-cappuccino" rel="nofollow"&gt;illy suggests&lt;/a&gt; quantities for a more traditional preparation, using espresso and steamed/foamed milk.&lt;/li&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;Most coffee shops sell biscotti to have with your coffee. I've always wondered, is there a 'correct' way of consuming them together? Are biscotti ideally consumed with a certain preparation of coffee (e.g. a capuccino but not a latte)? Should I be dunking, or is that frightfully uncultured?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Adapting "Golf is a good walk spoiled," (whoever said it; &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/in-the-news-what-mark-twain-didnt-say-posthumous-money-pit" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Twain probably didn't&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;biscotti is a sure way to destroy a good coffee.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Dipping in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin_Santo" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;that wine&lt;/a&gt; sounds marginally worse than dunking in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soft, cookie-like biscotti available in many cafes won't hold up to any dunking at all, and will end up waterlogged and sad at the end of your sipping. The break-your-teeth traditional biscotti seem to call for something, but they don't seem edible to me. I prefer the &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/9256/how-to-make-softer-biscotti"&gt;middle-of-the-road, softer, chewy biscotti&lt;/a&gt; that can be enjoyed without submerging in liquid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the risk of this becoming an opinion-based discussion, for my money: &lt;strong&gt;If you want to drink coffee, just drink coffee.  If you want to eat a soggy cookie, eat a soggy cookie... but don't combine the two&lt;/strong&gt; and risk ruining your perfectly good coffee in the process. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;French Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single Cup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering that they might have to use different types of filters. The types of filter might vary on the coffee maker. Some say that single cup coffee makers should only use paper filters (I don't know why) and others might have to use this type of coffee filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is, do each of these have a certain filter you have to use with them or can they use multiple types?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Due to the fact that this is a lengthy question, I will try to be concise and to the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, yes, all of these main types coffee makers use a different type or size of filter. Sometimes each type can use a different filter. I will provide a non-exhaustive list of filter types for these coffee makers which you have listed. Although the list in non-exhaustive, it will provide the main types of filters for each device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Permanent versus Paper filters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A permanent filter is often made out of metal and is, in most cases, a mesh (not true for espresso machines). They are not disposable and are made to be reused many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An impermanent filter is generally made out of paper and is disposable and is generally not meant to be reused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Drip Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drip Coffee machines are one of the most common coffee machines for home use. The filter used will either be paper or permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A paper filter for the drip coffee machine will either be flat-bottom or cone-shaped depending on the make and model of the coffee machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat-bottom filters:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIiwu.jpg" alt="Flat-bottom Filter"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cone shaped filter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ntWce.jpg" alt="Cone shaped filter"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The permanent filter can take the same shapes, however it is generally a flat-bottom shape yet can be a hybrid between a cone shaped and a flat-bottom shaped filter. I can only describe this as an upside down triangular prism. Below is a picture of the aforementioned hybrid filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CvRrn.png" alt="Hybrid cone filter"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Single Cup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These filters are generally made out of paper and are usually a cone shape which is usually specific/unique to the type of single cup brewing device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;French (Push) Press&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A french or push uses a permanent filter which is made out of a fine metal mesh. It is on the bottom of the plunger. The entire bottom of the filter has three main parts, shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Parts of a French Press Filter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xrAHF.jpg" alt="French Press Filter Parts"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Espresso Machine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An espresso machine's filter is called a portafilter. It shaped like a small basket, made out of metal, and has small holes in the metal on the bottom. There are three sizes. The most common are the single and double shot filters and a rarer one is the triple shot filter. They increase in size to hold more ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are generally three types of portafilters in circulation with mainstream home espresso machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single wall. This is the most common in the industrial setting. It is contains only one wall on the bottom of the filter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double wall. Think about this as a portafilter for the inexperienced and is most common for the home espresso machine. It has a secondary wall on the bottom of the portafilter with only a few holes in it. The presence of two walls helps to regulate extraction pressure and is therefore good for those who are not very good at tamping pressure and grind size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pod filter. This is simply a specially designed filter that is the same shape as the others and comes with some home espresso machines. They are used to hold pre-made and pre-packaged espresso pods that one simply drops into the filter and can avoid many of the other steps of traditional espresso brewing such as tamping and grinding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portafilters (single wall) on left and baskets (which hold them and are upside down) on the right:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZeKtK.jpg" alt="Portafilters"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filter on the left is a single shot and the filter on the right is a double shot.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does the gas from degassing ground coffee smell bad?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a jar with ground coffee stored in a cupboard. Every time I open that cupboard a specific smell gets out, one that can surely be associated with coffee but that is not the same one that you can smell when opening the jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That smell is something like the "bad version" of that good and invigorating smell of ground coffee. Is not pleasant, and more acute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does that gas have a different smell? Is it due to carbon dioxide and/or the polyphenols?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;My guess, based on what you've said, is that the two processes involved (that are giving you the off-smells) are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;oxidation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancidification" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rancidification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rancidification ("going rancid") is a process by which fats (oils) break down into... other chemicals you don't want (and smell bad). The smell could be described as rank or rotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oxidation is another class of chemical reaction that could also produce off-smells and tastes. This could be caused by contact with air (specifically, for example, oxygen) or other factors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autolysis_(biology)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;autolysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes other factors of, for example, plant material breaking down by itself over time (e.g., self-degredation by a cell's own enzymes). There are likely other factors like this, if you store coffee (especially pre-ground!) for any length of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These descriptions are admittedly non-technical. If you're looking for more, ping me in comments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See also this question and its answers: &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off"&gt;When does coffee go off?&lt;/a&gt;  It discusses oxidation and other factors. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Light-colored matter clinging to roasted coffee beans</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;On a recent shopping trip I bought some locally roasted beans from Rwanda, which were labelled "Karenge".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aroma is delicious, but on opening the bag I immediately noticed light-colored matter clinging to the clefts of the roasted beans (click for close-up):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jVKHi.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jVKHim.jpg" alt="Karenge beans from Rwanda"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon grinding light-colored flecks are noticeable in their contrast with the dark coffee grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is this light-colored matter, and does its presence result from shortcuts in the coffee production or processing?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;What you are likely seeing is the &lt;a href="http://coffee.wikia.com/wiki/Coffee_bean"&gt;silverskin&lt;/a&gt; of the coffee cherry.  Green coffee beans prior to roasting generally still have the silverskin intact/attached.  As the bean expands during roasting and the silverskin dries out, it generally comes off.  Part of the roasting process is some sort of agitation and airflow to remove this chaff.  Depending on the roast level and other mechanical factors, more or less of the silverskin may be removed.  On lighter roasted coffee with less expansion you can often see bits of silverskin along the seam on the bean.  Some processing methods prior to roasting also remove less of the silverskin, "dry processed" coffee in particular tends to be more chaffy when roasting and may require a longer time agitating or smaller roast batches to remove chaff.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my lighter roasts end up with a bit more chaff than I'd like.  Like most anything involving coffee, you can find differing opinions on how much it affects taste.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I make my coffee taste stronger using a french press or gold filter?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I like drinking my own coffee at work, as it's cheaper and more convienient than buying espresso. However, recently I've been finding myself wanting a more long-black like espresso coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I achieve this using either a french press/plunger or a gold filter? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy my homemade French-pressed coffee more than anything I can buy at an espresso shop, though a long black is my preferred choice if I'm away from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of strengths of the espresso shop's infrastructure which you can emulate on a smaller scale:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Good coffee beans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy good fresh whole beans and grind them right before you prepare the drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Strong extraction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use more coffee and/or grind it more finely. More surface area will make it extract more and taste stronger. You can even make it really thick and creamy and add it on top of water for the long-black-like experience.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Difference between Brew and Keep Warm?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering about the difference between &lt;em&gt;brew&lt;/em&gt; mode and &lt;em&gt;keep warm&lt;/em&gt; mode in drip coffee makers. After my Black and Decker 2020B finishes brewing, it keeps the heating element warm for 2 hours. Is that different than if it had simply continued to brew for 2 hours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I want to &lt;em&gt;reheat&lt;/em&gt; my coffee after the keep warm period has ended, is there anything wrong with simply turning it on  to &lt;em&gt;brew&lt;/em&gt;? Would that be the same as the keep warm period and thus be fine, or would it cause the heating element to behave differently and possibly burn the coffee or cause a fire hazard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Normally in a drip coffee machine the 'brew' mode is where the water in the reservoir is boiled/heated and dripped over the ground coffee, before passing through the filter and into the jug. The 'keep warm' part is usually a hot plate under the jug which heats the jug from below, keeping the coffee warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My drip coffee machine doesn't allow you to switch it to one mode or the other, you just switch it on and it pumps the water through the filter until its empty - there is a floating switch in the bottom so it knows when there is no more water left, and the hot plate is always on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume that your drip coffee machine works in the same way but has separate controls for the brew and keep warm features. Switching the 'keep warm' feature back on isn't going to harm anything - I'd question the quality of the coffee after 2+ hours sitting on a hot plate though. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Reusing paper filter by placing metallic net filter in it</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;First, what I do; then, the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to brew coffee one cup at a time. To avoid waste, I only brew as much as I need, so I usually drink it all.  In order to further reduce waste, I have tried metallic net filters instead of paper filters, but they tend to allow an ultra fine silt to pass through, the presence of which at the bottom of the cup is annoying if the plan is to drink all the coffee.  So, I started doing this: first I place a paper filter in the coffee maker, to collect the ultra fine silt, which is actually very small in volume, and inside the paper filter I place the metallic net filter to collect the actual coffee grounds, which are 99% of the volume. Then, I brew my coffee.  When it is time to make more coffee, I only remove and wash the metallic net filter; the paper filter stays in its place, and gets reused about five times before it has collected so much ultra-fine silt that it is time to replace it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you see anything seriously wrong with this technique?  Does it perhaps have any side effects that I should be aware of?  Would such a practice be considered yucky by some?  (If it is, then this is a cultural issue that perhaps I should be aware of.)  Obviously, the coffee smells and tastes fine to me, but I have to wonder whether noses and palates that are more sensitive than mine think otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, it says "we prefer questions that can be answered, not just discussed", so if you have something to say, please just state it without starting a long discussion about it!  C-:=&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Brewed coffee ages like milk.  As soon as it is brewed its flavor begins to degrade and deteriorate, which is why it always tastes much better freshly brewed.  While you may not necessarily taste the difference from one pot to the next, it has definitely changed your overall expectation of the flavor.  The bouquet of coffee also is very complex, as is obvious from the fact that there is a distinct change in the scent from the time you grind to the time the brewing stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One flavor issue with reusing paper filters is that they tend to stop a large amount of the oils in the coffee from making it into the final product.  This could be desirable, as many (myself included) prefer the taste of paper-filtered coffee that does not contain the compounds found in the crema (the thin layer of foam on top of espresso, Turkish or French-press coffee).  These, which are often a combination of both sweet and bitter, are trapped by paper filters, but they will break down in the paper over multiple uses and wash into your coffee anyway, but not necessarily in the same form, which further changes the flavor profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If waste is a major concern, but you prefer paper-filtered coffee, you can make a compromise and use an Aeropress.  These use filters that are only about 2 inches in total diameter, meaning less gets tossed with each brew.  You could also look into filters made with recycled paper.  It won't reduce the waste, but it will reduce the environmental impact somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, though, that in the end paper filters are biodegradable and, if thrown away along with the grounds, can actually aid in creation of compost -- a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What happens to Colombian beans that do not make Supremo or Extra?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm learning about Colombian coffee and its &lt;a href="http://www.coffeereview.com/coffee-reference/coffee-categories/geographic-origins/coffees-from-the-americas/colombia/"&gt;national grading standards&lt;/a&gt; of Supremo (highest) and Extra (second highest). Does anyone know what percentage of all beans produced falls into those two categories? What happens to the beans that don't make one of those two grades?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;They get sold for less money as "standard export" grade coffee.  Because of NFC's marketing campaign, ANY sort of Colombian coffee ends up with higher brand recollection than most other coffee.  There is a slightly slanted view of the matter &lt;a href="https://www.sweetmarias.com/library/content/colombia-0" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The writers are coffee aficionados who prize distinctive origin flavors in their coffee, which is rarely present in NFC graded coffee since they are more often than not mixed batches of beans from different growers.  That isn't to say that the NFC's work doesn't ensure high standards for Colombian exports, but it isn't favorable to some sectors of the coffee market who prize distinct coffee from a single origin.

  <title>Is there a "standard" ratio of espresso to milk in a latte?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;If I order a caffè latte from a coffee shop, will it always be the same strength? As in the same ratio of espresso to milk? For example, I think I heard that Starbucks UK use more espresso than is normal, though I can't remember if that's compared to "normal for a latte" or the other Starbuckses in the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or does it vary wildly from shop to shop (and thus I need to learn or ask at each individual coffee shop)?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It varies by shop and order.  For instance, order a latte at Starbucks, you have a selection of sizes, and then variance in the number of shots (or espresso) you order in the drink.  Since the sizes are not doubled (12, 16, 20 ounces, not 12, 24, 36) and half shots are not a thing, the ratio will vary at the order level.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can coffee pods be recycled?</title>

&lt;p&gt;What are these capsules actually made of? How much of the materials can be usefully recovered for recycling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How widespread are recycling facilities? Presumably it will vary depending on the system and country etc.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Keurig have publicly stated they are switching to using fully recyclable materials by 2020 (I have no idea why it will take them five years to implement something most companies have been doing for decades, but that's beside the point).  You can see more at &lt;a href="http://www.keuriggreenmountain.com/en/Sustainability/SustainableProducts/OurProducts/ReducingProductWaste.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;their Web site&lt;/a&gt;.  You can also get Keurig-compatible (although not "approved") pods that do not have the outer plastic.  They are just an upper ring, a foil cover and a filter with grounds dangling loose.  While some of these make great coffee, I am told they go stle rather quickly if you don't have a tightly sealed container in which to store them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flavia/Alterra have their own recycling program.  I don't know about home-use situations, but at least for managed, corporate-use programs, their single-serve packets can be recycled using the packet-disposal boxes they provide.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;Several times one hears that drinking too much coffee produces an increase in blood pressure, that may be dangerous with people with cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it caffeine the only chemical to blame for this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder this because Tea and Mate (and also Chocolate) contain caffeine as well, and I've never heard of such a danger regarding to Tea and Chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is not that only drug that can raise blood pressure.  In fact many other drugs are much better at raising blood pressure and have fewer side effects.  If you are asking specifically about the chemicals in coffee, then yes, caffeine is the likely culprit if coffee causes raised blood pressure in an individual.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tea and chocolate also contain caffeine, but of course lower concentration than what is found in coffee.  Eating large amounts of chocolate or drink large quantities of tea could have a similar effect to drinking moderate amounts of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is this coffee Kombucha?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;About three weeks ago, I brewed iced coffee in a clean jar; I didn't drink all of it and left it in the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 1/2 the jar was filled, I then traveled and when I came back, I found in the bottom of the jar something sticky like rubber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this Kombucha ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't use any kind of "scoby" aka starter, it's just ground coffee with cold water and sugar. This isn't the first time this happened. It smells just as coffee would, nothing bad.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In order to be Kombucha, you would need to have a starter, unless (somehow) enough bacteria was present in the coffee / sugar / cup (highly unlikely). It would also be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; unlikely that even if a culture was unwittingly introduced, that it would bloom in cold water. It's not Kombucha unless it's actually fermented, and for that, you need a live, active &lt;em&gt;thriving&lt;/em&gt; culture (you must have a starter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you've &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; got at the bottom of the cup is a combination of settled sugars and residual grounds. While I doubt that tasting it would be harmful, I wouldn't quite recommend it :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Keurig Coffee Maker gets clogged and slow</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Recently my family passed down the first Keurig we ever got. I'm pretty sure it's the first one. &lt;a href="http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/keurig/k45-elite-brewing-system_en_general?wid=272&amp;amp;hei=202&amp;amp;fmt=png-alpha&amp;amp;qlt=75,1&amp;amp;op_sharpen=0&amp;amp;resMode=bicub&amp;amp;op_usm=1,1,6,0&amp;amp;iccEmbed=0&amp;amp;printRes=72&amp;amp;extend=0,250,0,0" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Here's a pic I found from the great Google.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I have been using it to fill my travelers mug before i go to work and it has been taking a long time. Sometimes it will fill my mug almost all the way up, sometimes it won't even hit half way. And it is extremely slow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried many different K-Cups but they all seem to have the same effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Due to the age and usage of your Keurig machine, I would say that you are experiencing two possible problems - one at a time or perhaps both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problems:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motor in the pump in your Keurig machine may simply just be getting worn out. If this is the problem, you should be able to hear it struggling to pump water out through the K-Cup. If you need a comparison, try comparing it to a newer model and see how it sounds. If de-scaling (see next problem) does not work, then you may need to replace the motor/pump. It may just be easier at that point to buy a new Keurig machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine seriously needs to be de-scaled. I would recommend running a solution of 25% lemon juice and 75% water through the machine. Make sure to run around 250 - 500 mL (about one to two cups) of this solution from the tank all the way through to a cup. Then rinse with atleast 1 L of of normal water (about 4 cups).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CAUTION:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have stated in other answers, breathing the fumes from this can be extremely dangerous for your mucosa (parts of the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, respiratory tract, and lungs). Do not breathe in the steam or fumes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a huge concern with lemon juice (which is why I recommend it), but if you were to use vinegar or a commercial de-scaler, this would be a huge concern. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just be smart about it. You don't want to end up with permanent damage to your respiratory tract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other possible problems (harder to fix):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be possible that a seal somewhere in the pump has worn out and air is entering the system as it is being pumped. This would involve replacing a seal and taking the machine apart though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be some other component, that I can't think of, that is damaged. Try the above solutions and leave a comment. Let me know if anything works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I changed coffee in my grinder, and now, coffee flow is very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to change 3 level of grinder for my new coffee...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Grinder level is coffee bean dependent? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Expanding comment into a (possible) answer...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the topic of &lt;strong&gt;different beans in a burr grinder:&lt;/strong&gt; I find that my (admittedly &lt;em&gt;cheap&lt;/em&gt;) burr grinder "chokes" on darker-roast beans. When I put dark roast beans into the grinder, the chute gets clogged with coffee grounds more quickly (as compared to lighter-roasted beans). I have a timer-based auto-shutoff model, and much less grounds come out when the grinder is "clogged" in this way. I attribute this clogging to the oil on the surface of the beans that is somehow "sticky" and more prevalent on darker roast beans, but I'm not certain. &lt;a href="http://coffeegeek.com/forums/coffee/questions/318466" rel="noreferrer"&gt;This article from Coffee Geek&lt;/a&gt; talks about cleaning more frequently for darker roast beans, as does &lt;a href="https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/learn/videos-home/ask-the-experts/burr-test-medium-dark-beans" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this review from Seattle Coffee Gear&lt;/a&gt;, as does &lt;a href="http://www.coffeereview.com/coffee-reference/from-crop-to-cup/grinding/burr-grinders/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this one from Coffee Review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the topic of &lt;strong&gt;espresso pulled from these grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; This is tricky and I'm really just speculating. Perhaps it's a similar situation: your darker-roast beans respond to tamping differently than your lighter-roast beans. If you're tamping hard and the grounds are clumping together somehow, you might be getting some channeling (resulting in uneven extraction); this could cause a more "watery" shot. You might be able to see evidence of this in the puck after you pull the shot, or you might be able to see it while pulling the shot if you use a naked (bottomless) portafilter. &lt;a href="https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-guide-diagnose-extraction-problems.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;This article from Home-Barista&lt;/a&gt; talks about a too-quick extraction being paired with grind flaws; are you seeing that? It also discusses various other flaws and corrections, too various to summarize here.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Will I develop a caffeine dependency by skipping 2 days?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months a ago I broke my daily caffeine habit because I disliked waking up every morning already "needing" caffeine. But, I LOVE coffee and I LOVE the buzz caffeine provides. So, for the past couple of weeks I have remained disciplined in having caffeine every third day. My reasoning is based mostly on the fact that the first 48 hours of withdrawal is the worst part of it, so I thought that by waiting 72 hours, I could have my buzz a few times a week without developing a chemical dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have anything science-based that can further inform me as to whether my thinking is right on this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;em&gt;absolutely develop a dependency&lt;/em&gt;.
The important thing to remember is that there are physical and mental aspects to addiction. If you look forward to it hard enough, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; amount of time can pass and you can still crave it just as deeply. Sometimes a deep craving can even result in symptoms that shouldn't be explainable by chemical explanations [Psychosomatic effects].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would also depend heavily on dosing. You would want to make sure that you don't try to compensate for your days off by going on a binge and placing yourself directly under the espresso maker until you've had 3 days worth! In fact, that could make the problem worse because the difference between your "on days" and off days would be so much greater you might await those days the same way a junkie looks forward to their next hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;droog has the right idea. Try to see if there are ways to rotate in other substitutes for coffee. Maybe you enjoy the hot drink, or you look forward to the short break it takes to prepare it. Regardless, people just don't go well with negative feedback. If you feel as if you are deeply depriving yourself, then change your approach. The way to be successful is to find a way that cuts down your caffeine intake while also not feeling as if you have lost something.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Which ginseng caffee should I order to get the experience of "Caffe al Ginseng" in Milano?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I visited Milano previous summer, I ordered "Caffe al Ginseng" in several places and I enjoyed a lot this coffee. Now I would like to order this kind of coffee on-line, but the shipping is quite expensive from Italy and there are too many options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can somebody propose me espresso ground coffees with ginseng extract or flavour to make Caffe al Ginseng at home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to "replicate" the same experience. It was pretty sweetish with strong flavour over the coffee taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this shop? &lt;a href="http://www.persalute.it/p/64/eng/red-ginseng-coffee-ground-coffee-250g.aspx" rel="noreferrer"&gt;http://www.persalute.it/p/64/eng/red-ginseng-coffee-ground-coffee-250g.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;According to Italian wikipedia, the first ginseng coffee popularized in Italy was an instant packet drink also sold in Asia. &lt;a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_al_ginseng" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffè_al_ginseng&lt;/a&gt;
If you're willing to go instant, you can try this: &lt;a href="http://www.veryasia.com/ginseng-coffee/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.veryasia.com/ginseng-coffee/&lt;/a&gt; (also available on Amazon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wiki entry suggests what you drank was probably espresso with dry ground ginseng. So if you don't want instant, you could get some espresso and add dry ground ginseng to the grounds. You can get ground ginseng at any Chinese herbal store. One writer, Peter Lim says a capsule (like the gelatine type you would swallow) is the right amount for a serving of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Moka pot induction heater</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering whether there was such a thing as a small induction heater/hob for moka pots? I have a small moka pot which I loath using on my electric hob. I think it is a waste of energy given that the smallest hot plate is significantly larger than my little moka pot. It would be great if I can get a small induction hob that I can just keep in the dining room to use when I fancy a post-dinner tipple. Another benefit for an induction hob is that it shouldn't get significantly hot, making it ideal for the dining room.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the purpose of the crimp on a moka funnel?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Spurred by &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/2024/262"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; recent &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/moka" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;moka&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;moka&lt;/a&gt; question...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funnel on my moka pot has a "crimp" -- a little ring-shaped indentation -- around the middle, similar to this one from Bialetti:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BlhFe.png" alt="moka pot funnel with arrow pointing to crimp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the purpose of this crimp?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is indented toward the middle of the funnel (i.e., not protruding out of the funnel). It's far too low to indicate recommended "fill line" for quantity of grounds (for my taste anyway!) There's no other attachment that fits into it, nor does it engage with any other part on the pot (e.g., the top lip of the funnel sits on the moka pot base). It's one piece of sheet metal; e.g., this isn't a point where two pieces attach. Some moka pots have funnels that have this crimp, and others are solid/flat around the side.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The crimp is there to support the &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/2026/127"&gt;reducer&lt;/a&gt;! The reducer slots into the funnel, and sits on the ridge. You then put coffee on top of it, allowing you to use less coffee in larger pots.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is a "dry process" coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have seen some varieties of unroasted coffee beans listed as a dry process.  What exactly is this referring to?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;With the dry process, the fruit is left intact for an initial fermentation stage. Then the beans are hulled, washed, dried again, sorted and graded (as with other processes). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's more expensive than other processing methods because of the real-estate and time and labor invested in the initial fermentation. But it seems to get &lt;em&gt;more fruit&lt;/em&gt; into the bean. Dry-processed coffees tend to have very complex fruit and wine notes that are not found (or rarely found) in washed and semi-washed process coffees.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee spider web score</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been purchasing unroasted green coffee beans for a while now, and they all seem to have this spider web looking diagram representing a composite score of some sort of the coffee.  &lt;a href="https://www.sweetmarias.com/product/tanzania-isende-fbg"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; link has an example of what I am talking about (fourth listed image).  Does anyone know how to interpret these scores.  Also, what does "Cupper's Correction" mean?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The graph shown is a spider-web graph that is similar to a line graph but in a shape of a spider web. In this case, the scale (middle line, goes from bottom to top) shows the score each section can get. A blue line (or any color) is drawn according to the scale. A score closer to six will have its vertex nearer to the center of the web and a score nearer to 10 will be nearer to the outside. This graph seems to be scoring the different qualities of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Cupper's Correction is used when the grapher thinks that the total score (add all the smaller ones) should be higher or lower. In this case, it's two so the original total score has two bonus points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source for Cupper's Correction: &lt;a href="http://legacy.sweetmarias.com/library/content/cuppers-correction"&gt;http://legacy.sweetmarias.com/library/content/cuppers-correction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The cupper's correction is a term we use to measure the intangible qualities of a cup: if, for instance, a coffee totals 88 points, but it is high quality enough that we feel it should&amp;lt; be a 90, we add in a +2 cupper's correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the "&amp;lt;" in the quote is a typo.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Store Costco beans in individual vacuum sealed canisters?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is it a good idea to split bulk (2-3 pound bags) Costco coffee beans into separate (1 pound) vacuum sealed canisters? This would be done quickly for reduced oxygen exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would use up a canister every 2 weeks. Will degradation of the beans over time (6 weeks total) be a significant problem?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;First, I think you need to start with the quality of the bean you bought. I have noticed both at Sam's Club and Costco that more often than not, the bags of beans are not sealed.  You need to dig to find a bag where the beans don't slide around inside the bag.  If you can shake the bag and the beans move around like a box of cereal, move on to the next bag!  If a bag has lost the seal, you don't know if it has been 'open' for a week or three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the debate goes back and forth about freezing or not freezing. Do what fits your life style best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the more you can limit exposure to oxygen until you use the bean the better.  Coffee beans are like a lot of other items, they can become stale over time if cared for properly.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What Type of Coffee Is Used In a Coffee-Maker?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I come from a land of tea-drinkers and have only recently taken a fancy to coffee. I just ordered &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00H34OA7U?psc=1&amp;amp;redirect=true&amp;amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; coffee-maker for myself, which is the first that I'll ever own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a bit perplexed as to what &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of coffee is used in a coffee-maker. It gets all the more confusing since I couldn't get my hands on all the types on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, I had been making coffee with the help of this Nescafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IFWNE.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IFWNE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this instant or ground coffee? What is the difference between the two? Can they be used in my coffee-maker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the coffee-maker, I also ordered myself a bottle of &lt;strong&gt;Grandos Espresso Instant Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;. Would I be able to make it with the help of my coffee-maker?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Ground coffee is just the roasted coffee beans ground up to a fine powder. In order to make the beverage coffee, you need to combine this with hot water to extract the flavour (there are many different ways to do this). Typically, there is a filter that makes sure that the water can pass through the ground coffee but none of the ground ends up in your drink. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instant coffee is dried brewed coffee - they grind up the coffee beans, brew the coffee and then remove the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coffee machine or coffee maker is used for brewing coffee from ground coffee, not instant coffee. Instant coffee powder just needs to be rehydrated, so adding hot water is enough. It will completely dissolve in the water, which the ground in a coffee maker will not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The machine you bought seems to be an espresso machine (it puts the water with high pressure through the ground coffee). This requires a relatively fine ground. Preground espresso will probably work, or you can also buy a grinder and grind the beans yourself. It also seems to have a pressurized filter basket, which means it will be quite forgiving and therefore easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does using an Aeropress keep more of the coffee oil (crema)?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that coffee made with my Aeropress has a much richer flavor even though I use the same water temperature, number of scoops, roast, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this because the Aeropress method produces crema (the tawny substance found in espresso shots)? And, if so, is there a way to optimize crema extraction with an Aeropress?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The aeropress does not produce crema. There is no where near enough pressure using the aeropress to produce crema. Crema doesn't make coffee better, its typically a sign of good espresso, but isn't found in any other form of brewing nor is it what make the coffee actually taste better. French presses don't create crema either, and its a misleading yet common belief that they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aeropress likely has about the same amount of oils as a pour-over cup of coffee if you're using the paper filters. The aeropress get it's richness from its style of brewing known as "immersion brewing". Longer contact with the grounds extracts compounds usually left behind by pour-over/drip methods. Combine with pressure, the aeropress, in short, just extracts more flavor by having a longer brew time and an environment which increases solubility with pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarification:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AeroPress has a short "brew time", however what I was meaning to say is that the aeropress and other immersion brewers have a longer contact time of the bean and the water. Therefore you have more extraction. The aeropress, unlike any other immersion method uses pressure to increase solubility. It's known that if you increase pressure that you extract quicker, and your solvent(water in this case) is able to achieve higher saturation.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;First thing to keep in mind is that taste varies from person, so you may try other beans/brews that have similar descriptions, so you can learn about your own taste perception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That been said, would be nice to know your equipment, in order to help you more. If you are using an espresso machine, maybe is time to have it cleaned. Mine was dirty a while ago and any beans would taste like burnt rubber, even light roasted ones. If you are using some infusion method (inverted aeropress or french press), try reducing the brewing time.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How long does it take to reset caffeine tolerance</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've read on different websites, mainly fitness related, about cycling a pre-workout due to a build up of caffeine tolerance. 
The suggestions generally range in 1-2 weeks, but I think this would be a great question to have here.  Some links would be nice, if you could point me to some studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, How long does it take to reset caffeine tolerance to pre-caffeine levels? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can lowering down caffeine for a period of time work as a partial caffeine tolerance recalibrator? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you are looking at cycling your caffeine naivety with an eye for fitness  benefit (caffeine increases exercise tolerance), I think you should first look into whether there is any true benefit to the cycling.  You are talking about purposefully inducing a cycle of addiction/dependence and withdrawal, however, I am not sure I have ever heard that the exercise tolerance from caffeine decreases as caffeine tolerance increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cycling (a sport I am familiar with) most pros maintain some level of caffeine tolerance.  I've the routine before the day's workout is an espresso or two.  I've never heard of cycling that caffeine intake.  With a doping and performance maximization such a ever present in cycling, it seems like if there was really benefit to cycling, it would be happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/5374-coffee-lessens-pain-exercise.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the exercise tolerance is the same or similar regardless of the level of caffeine dependence. (&lt;a href="http://users.clas.ufl.edu/msscha/premed/caffeine_musclepain.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;actual study here&lt;/a&gt;) The most I could find online for cycling was some bodybuilding forums talking about cycling their pre-workout stimulants.  Not really any specific information about what is contained in the mess of supplements they are taking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on that study and the lack of information for cycling caffeine tolerance, I'd suggest that the withdrawal symptoms and side effects of caffeine consumption on naive individuals are not worth the purported but undocumented benefit of cycling your caffeine consumption.  I think while it's true that some of the mental stimulation and other effects of caffeine may taper off with tolerance, the exercise tolerance benefit does not.  However, individuals ignorant of this, or seeking mainly the mental stimulant part of caffeine effects, may resort to cycling their caffeine intake.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR The bottom line is for physical performance, there is not a reason to cycle.  For mental performance there is a build up of tolerance and off periods would provide a benefit at the cost of symptoms encountered during the withdrawal period.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How does using coffee filter make the coffee different?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Somewhere I read that coffee contains carcinogens unless it's filtered, and I think I've noticed that such filtered coffee seems to be weaker. I let it stay for about 5-10min, and it still tastes weaker than coffee made without a coffee filter (paper one of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is, how is a filtered coffee different from unfiltered coffee, assuming we're using a paper filter? Mainly I'm looking for a scientific explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you want stronger coffee (referring specifically to the amount of total dissolved solids), then you really just need a stronger coffee to water ratio. Or just simply add more coffee. 
Although what I think you are really experiencing is a difference in mouth feel. Using a paper filter with certainly give the coffee clarity. Really fine paper filters (like a chemex filter - being thick and made from soft woods) will evidently filter out very small particles - which results in a very delicate, crisp, and light mouth feel tasting cup of coffee. On the opposite end of the spectrum you have the french press. Which you end up having tiny fine particles left in your end cup, which gives a great amount of body, and a very heavy mouth feel. Both are totally fine cups of coffee, but are totally subjective to your palate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing about extraction is that you really only want to extract about 20% of the coffee you have. If you look at an extraction versus time graphed out, you can see that it represents the curve y=sqrt(x), where extraction continues to increase as time goes on, but at a slower and slower rate. All this means is that by simply letting your coffee brew longer, you are not exactly going to make it any stronger past a certain point. You simply just need to add more coffee. As for the filter - your over all brew strength, or total dissolved solids - should basically be the exact same compared to if you didn't filter it with paper. The main difference is how it's being presented to your mouth. &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSquf.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSquf.png" alt="Extraction versus Time graph"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a good starting place is a 1:16 ratio, meaning 1 parts coffee to 16 parts water. Depending on how that taste to you, just manipulate it until desired. Hopefully this helps out! &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does adding milk to coffee reduce its antioxidant properties</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I heard this a while back, the milk binds with the antioxidant molecules of the coffee and renders them useless. A quick Google seems to suggest that this isn't true but the study which concluded this was conducted by Nestle so was no doubt biased. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A follow up question would be, if you drink black coffee and have cereal for breakfast does that pretty much count as putting milk in your coffee too?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I found that generally, scientific studies do show a negative impact on phytochemicals like antioxidants, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308682" rel="nofollow"&gt;one such example&lt;/a&gt; stating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An immediate decrease in the total antioxidant activity (23%) and total phenolic content (14%) was observed after addition of strawberry preparations to yoghurt. The total anthocyanin content did not change immediately, but decreased 24% throughout the yoghurt shelf-life. The individual compounds, (+)-catechin (60%), (-)-epicatechin (60%), kaempferol (33%) and quercetin-3-rutinoside (29%) decreased after 24h in the yoghurt made with the strawberry preparation. During the remaining period of storage these compounds increased by 47%, 6%, 4% and 18%, respectively. Pelargonidin-3-glucoside decreased 49% after 28 d. Immediately after the addition of the strawberry preparation to yoghurt, ?-lactoglobulin decreased to values lower than the limit of detection and ?-lactalbumin by approximately 34%, and was reduced further slowly throughout yoghurt self-life. An immediate interaction between the carrageenan present in the strawberry preparation and ?-LG was observed. The variations of both polyphenols and protein in the presence of carrageenan and the potential interactions were discussed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, some phytochecmicals are available to the consumer longer than others in the presence of dairy. To be fair to the &lt;a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/2/259.abstract?etoc" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Institute of Nutrition study&lt;/a&gt; referred to in the Nestle press release, they do not indicate &lt;em&gt;for how long&lt;/em&gt; the antioxidants are still available after the introduction of dairy they only notate that after consumption they found coffee phenolics in the plasma of their test subjects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chlorogenic acids (CGA) are antioxidants found in coffee. They are becoming of interest for their health-promoting effects, but bioavailability in humans is not well understood. We hypothesized that adding whole milk or sugar and nondairy creamer to instant coffee might modulate the bioavailability of coffee phenolics. Nine healthy participants were asked to randomly drink, in a crossover design, instant coffee (Coffee); instant coffee and 10% whole milk (Milk); or instant coffee, sugar, and nondairy creamer already premixed (Sugar/NDC). All 3 treatments provided the same amount of total CGA (332 mg). Blood was collected for 12 h after ingestion and plasma samples treated using a liquid-liquid extraction method that included a full enzymatic cleavage to hydrolyze all CGA and conjugates into phenolic acid equivalents. Hence, we focused our liquid chromatography-Electrospray ionization-tandem MS detection and quantification on caffeic acid (CA), ferulic acid (FA), and isoferulic acid (iFA) equivalents. Compared with a regular black instant coffee, the addition of milk did not significantly alter the area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), or the time needed to reach Cmax (Tmax). The Cmax of CA and iFA were significantly lower and the Tmax of FA and iFA significantly longer for the Sugar/NDC group than for the Coffee group. However, the AUC did not significantly differ. As a conclusion, adding whole milk did not alter the overall bioavailability of coffee phenolic acids, whereas sugar and nondairy creamer affected the Tmax and Cmax but not the appearance of coffee phenolics in plasma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nestle press release found at &lt;em&gt;www.nestle.com/media/newsandfeatures/good-news-milk-cream-coffee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever line of research you choose to follow, it may not really impact your health over much anyway. The National Center for Complimentary and Integrated Health summarizes antioxidant research saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Several decades of dietary research findings suggested that consuming greater amounts of antioxidant-rich foods might help to protect against diseases. Because of these results, there has been a lot of research on antioxidant supplements. Rigorous trials of antioxidant supplements in large numbers of people have not found that high doses of antioxidant supplements prevent disease.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Actual Cezve: advice for buying</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'd like to buy 200-300ml &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cezve" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Cezve&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure what features are important, such as what material it's made of, handle design, pot shape, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the important features to look for when purchasing a cezve, as far as function or usability is concerned?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are many things to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not really important whether it is copper or not. (Copper is for tourists in Turkey and generally of bad quality.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I advise you to choose a stainless steel one. If you choose copper, find a real thick copper one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here, you can see a very good, thick copper cezve that I encountered. However, this is quite expensive (&gt;100$) and really hard to find even in Turkey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ypCzp.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ypCzp.jpg" alt="thick copper cezve"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thermal capacity... The thermal capacity must be high. It's hard to explain this on text. The cezve must be a bit sturdy. This is all I can say. The copper ones aren't generally sturdy. A bit thicker stainless steel ones are nicer for that. So, you can brew your coffee fast and also homogeneously distribute the heat. This is quite important when preparing your coffee in your own hands. The traditional copper ones are traditional as copper was easier to produce historically. Steel is easier to shape now. So, you can go for steel. An indicator for good thermal capacity is the boiling character of your coffee. If your coffee starts to boil from the edges, then it is possible that the thermal capacity is less than it should be (or the fire is way too strong to brew coffee).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bottom must be a bit larger than the top. So you can easily keep it on the oven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The slope I can advice is abut 10 degrees from bottom to top for best brewing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The height must not be more than 10-15 centimeters to stir the coffee easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take care about right/left-handedness. Some cezves have the option to flow the coffee only on one side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this will help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here, I'm adding a photo of my own. It is a right-handed stainless steel one. It's thickness is about 1 mm. No slope at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Roasting my coffee beans</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just read online that some people roast their coffee bean before they grind the bean, to adjust the flavor. This sounds really interesting, and I would like to try. I would like to do this properly, and I am wondering about couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What temperature to use, and for how long? I would imagine that this is determined by the current roast of the coffee and the target roast I would like, is there any kind of lookup table as a guidance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people mentioned cooling and de-gas after roast. What does that mean? I understand the cooling part, but what kind of process is de-gas - I guess it is some process happening on its own as the bean is cooled, but I am curious what exactly it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Your first question isn't clear exactly.  All &lt;strong&gt;drinkable coffee&lt;/strong&gt; has been roasted first, as raw coffee beans are not edible. I've read that re-roasting beans isn't practical for some reason that I'm not clear on, but I agree with Peter Pei Guo's, comment about why you would want to re-roast coffee in the first place.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after roasting, coffee beans produce carbon dioxide gas as a result of the chemical changes happening inside the bean.  This gas takes some time to be released from the interior of the bean, anywhere &lt;strong&gt;from 3-5 days&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've brewed my own home roasted coffee immediately after roasting to see if this is really true, and yes, it is.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after roasting the coffee has a really harsh, sour taste from the acidity that accompanies carbon dioxide gas (carbolic acid).  It also foamed (bloomed) really violently with the addition of hot water.  After resting the roasted coffee for about &lt;strong&gt;5 days&lt;/strong&gt;, the coffee from the same batch of beans &lt;strong&gt;tasted great&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of &lt;strong&gt;the indicators&lt;/strong&gt; of freshly roasted coffee beans is &lt;strong&gt;the bloom&lt;/strong&gt; that they produce as some residual carbon dioxide gas is released with &lt;strong&gt;the addition of hot water&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;time passes&lt;/em&gt; and the beans begin to stale a bit, the &lt;em&gt;bloom lessens&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;strong&gt;disappears&lt;/strong&gt;.  After properly resting freshly roasted coffee however, &lt;strong&gt;the small amount of residual carbon dioxide doesn't affect the taste&lt;/strong&gt;.  Immediately &lt;em&gt;after roasting&lt;/em&gt; however, the &lt;em&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/em&gt; levels are &lt;strong&gt;too high&lt;/strong&gt; to allow good tasting coffee when brewed.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does coffee really stunt your growth?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have heard that coffee (or other chemicals such as caffeine in it) can actually prevent you from growing. Is this really true?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No.&lt;/strong&gt; That coffee (or caffeine or anything else in coffee) would stunt growth is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;debunked myth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/18/health/the-claim-drinking-coffee-can-stunt-a-childs-growth.html"&gt;an article from the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that cites a small university study that showed no relation in bone density/gain in adolescents. Another article &lt;a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/its-a-myth-theres-no-evidence-that-coffee-stunts-kids-growth-180948068/"&gt;from Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt; cites the same article and a few other studies from the NIH and others that show very little impact of caffeine / coffee on related growth factors, the other factors which are largely explained by other factors (e.g., sugar or other stuff from other types of beverages).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, caffeine and other chemicals in coffee have certain other effects, and certain people are sensitive. Here's a related article about some &lt;a href="http://udel.edu/~danikoll/Factormyth.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; coffee myths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Will my tap water work for brewing espresso?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just picked up a Gaggia Classic and I am wondering if my delicious Denver tap water will do the trick or if I should go with something bottled. I am looking &lt;a href="http://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&amp;amp;d=water-standards" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the espresso standards and &lt;a href="http://www.denverwater.org/docs/assets/5EB822C6-EDF3-C0C9-871E2F58438E152B/2013WaterQualityReport.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the Denver water report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearest I can tell, it's pretty close to the sweet spot for total dissolved solids but I don't know how to decipher the other values like pH. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to descale every now and again so mostly I am just curious if this H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O will cause any serious pain. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Provided that you descale your machine whenever needed, your machine should not take damage from using tap water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since your tap water is also safe to drink, this leaves &lt;strong&gt;taste&lt;/strong&gt; as the only reason for concern. Dealing with this question is simple: just make a direct comparison between bottled-water espresso and tap water espresso. Check if you taste any noticeable differences. If this is not the case, the tap water should be fine. While there may be "guidelines for taste" as far as the tap water vs. bottled water question is concerned (e.g., softer water is typically better), what tastes good and what does not is a very complex question - so the tasting is the only way to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you will need to descale your machine from time to time in both cases - so using bottled water to avoid descaling is probably not cost-effective (nor environmental friendly).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it normal for coffee beans branded "Seattle Mountain" to shine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I bought a bag of Seattle Mountain coffee beans from Costco. Not sure whether it was freshly baked in the store, but I suspect that was the case, since there was a station right beside the coffee section (although I do not really know what that station is for, merely a guess).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bean is particular shiny. After grinding, it tends to stick together a bit, very loosely though. I have two questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the shininess indicate that it is freshly baked? Does it indicate it contains a higher level of some sort of oil?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the powder occasionally forms small chunks, does that make the process less efficient when the water running through it? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;To start, I would highly doubt the beans were roasted there in store.  Roasting at a commercial level takes large specialized equipment that would be dangerous for average customers to be around (400F+ after all) and create a smell that would easily fill the entire store and be unpleasant to some customers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, unless there is a roasting date on the bag, there isn't really a way to tell exactly when the beans were roasted.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oils on the outside of a bean can mean many things.  Any given bean will generally become more oily and shinier as it is roasted darker and the oils migrate to the outside of the bean.  This is a process that happens near instantaneously with the roasting process.  However, it also continues much more slowly after the roasting process and beans that have been improperly stored or become stale may become more oily than they were immediately after roasting.  However, some processing methods will also produce beans that become more oily earlier in the roast process.  Dry processed coffee will often start to oil at a much lower roast level that coffee processed by current wet methods.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oil does not make the process less efficient by any noticeable measure.  Some of the oil is transferred to the paper filter and some ends up in a cup.  Many people claim to prefer metal mesh filters because more of the oil (and flavor) ends up in the cup.  However, other people claim they can't tell the difference.  The oiliness CAN affect the grinding process if the grinding machine is gravity fed and the beans cling to each other or the container too much.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR The oil level or sheen of the coffee can't tell you much unless you know other things about the coffee as well.  It doesn't effect the brew process very much either.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does coffee lose caffeine as it is roasted?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have heard that coffee actually loses caffeine as you roast it, which means darker blends have less caffeine. Why is this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is a very common misconception.  Coffee does not lose caffeine as it is roasted.  It is often misunderstood that darker roasts have less caffeine. Caffeine's melting point is 455F which is well above what most beans reach during the roasting process. Essentially, caffeine content changes because the mass/density of the beans change (they lose water and undergo changes in the roasting process). If you measure your coffee by volume, dense greener beans will have more caffeine. If you measure by weight, darker roasted beans will have more caffeine.  The total amount of caffeine in a batch of beans changes very little, if any.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Different grinding size for boil coffee and coffee maker?</title>

&lt;p&gt;When whole beans is not an alternative in a store, you often have the choice between coffee ground for a drip coffee maker, and for immersion (boiled) coffee. Is grind size then important?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes.  For a drip coffee maker, most people will want to use a medium grind that balances getting enough extraction and still allowing the water to flow through the coffee grounds.  For immersion (boiled) coffee, you generally want a course grind that will slow extraction somewhat (reduce the chance of over extraction) and make the grounds less likely to end up in the final product.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can a handheld milk frother produce micro-foam?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When steaming milk with a steam wand, many sources I've found say that the texturing stage of milk frothing can only be done before the milk reaches body temperature, hence why cooling milk and milk jugs is important, as it allows more time for this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an handheld milk frother (such as Aerolatte) needs milk to be heated before it froths, is it possible to produce a good quality micro-foam?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It certainly won't compare to a steam wand, but yes you can totally get okay milk texture using one. In all honesty though, I've had better success using a french press. Heat milk via stove stop, put your milk into a clean french press, and push and pull the plunge repeatedly until your milk froths. It's not perfect - but good enough to pour some latte art.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>When preparing a ristretto shot, should the brew time remain the same as a normale?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have heard that a ristretto shot is in the realm of 1:1.1-1.5  bean to coffee yield ratio &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/2456"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Is the brew time to remain the same? I have used about 25s as a rule of thumb for my espresso shots. If so, the flow of coffee from the machine is very slow, but if not the shot can be completed very quickly. I have tried both preparations and prefer keeping the shot time constant. Is this the prevailing wisdom?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The time could absolutely stay the same for both your ristretto and normale shots. But - for that to happen your grind is certainly going to have to change, and obviously your yield (since you are now pulling a smaller / ristretto shot). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example:
If you pull a shot that's:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20g in | 25s | 20g out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you decide to pull a larger/normale shot, but you want to keep the time constant. Then you are basically forced to loosen your grind to a coarser grind size.
Then you could pull your normale at: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20g in | 25s | 30g out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that answers your question!&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;What is the name of the coffee, and what are the benefits of the beans digested by cats?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Civet coffee, also known as Kopi Luwak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some excerpts from the Wikipedia entry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;refers to the coffee that includes part-digested coffee cherries eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;in the coffee industry, kopi luwak is widely regarded as a gimmick or
  novelty item...
  "general consensus within the industry ... it just tastes bad"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It would appear that the Luwak processing diminishes good acidity and
  flavor and adds smoothness to the body, which is what many people seem
  to note as a positive to the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gist of it: The animal is supposed to pick the ripest beans and eat them. So its only getting good ripe beans. The animal partially digested the beans, and that process is supposed to improve the flavor. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it possible to roast coffee in an industrial glass kiln?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could you roast coffee in an industrial glass kiln and it be drinkable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strange question and purely hypothetical. This came about with a discussion with one of my friends who is a glass maker at university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thoughts was that you could not control the temperature enough, however he did state that with glass making, the art is in how fast you can heat and cool down the kiln. So in effect, I don't think the temperature control would be an issue. I feel my issues are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rotating of the coffee
during the roasting (as it would not be in a drum). It's possible to "spin" glass in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_casting_(mirrors)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this
way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post roast cooling, would there be a way you could make a makeshift
cooling bed that would be somewhat effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drinkable&lt;/strong&gt; - I guess this depends on personal taste, so for the sake of this exercise I will state that drinkable as the quality of instant coffee. So something you would drink to be polite but not find any pleasure in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you can run the kiln at sufficiently &lt;strong&gt;low&lt;/strong&gt; temperatures and have a solution for stirring the beans, yes you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; roast coffee beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Drinkable" on the other hand is a hard to quantify term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you would roast the raw beans slowy until 200 - 230 C over a time window of 15 - 25 minutes, depending on desired darkness and roast type. 
This allows for a long and slow &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maillard reaction&lt;/a&gt; and reduces the content of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorogenic_acid" rel="nofollow"&gt;chlorogenic acid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Your extremely hot kiln ("cold" glass techniques use temperatures over 800C!) woud be even harsher than industrial roasters with their "90 seconds at 400 C" method. No time for a good Maillard reaction and reduction of chlorogenic acid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while you probably can roast (= darken) the beans in a kiln if you are really quick, the results would lack the aromatic profile desired in good quality roasts and the probability of having just a "burnt and sour" brew is extremely high.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Decaffeinated Coffee Beans</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently bought a bean-to-cup coffee machine and I drink a lot more coffee than I should. As decaffeinated coffee would do me good, I was hoping that there was a decaf coffee bean. I would like to use the bean grinding function of my machine but I do not want the caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's no strain of coffee bean that has no caffeine when it is grown, but you can find whole-bean, decaffeinated coffee.&lt;/strong&gt; "Decaffeinated" coffee has been treated to have most of the caffeine removed. Decaffeination is done when the beans are still whole, so you can certainly find whole-bean, decaffeinated coffee (though I suppose decaffeination could also be done after grinding). The decaffeination process is often done with whole, green (not-yet-roasted) beans, which are subsequently roasted (still whole). Most places will sell whole-bean, decaf coffee -- local coffee roasters, coffee shops, markets, mail order from the usual suspects... &lt;a href="http://store.starbucks.co.uk/decaf-espresso-roast-fairtrade-certified/011037989,en_GB,pd.html?&amp;amp;srule=Featured&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;sz=12&amp;amp;cgid=whole-bean&amp;amp;prefn1=decaffeinated&amp;amp;prefv1=decaffeinated" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/en/coffee-at-home/whole-bean-coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;illy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.lavazza.co.uk/uk/at-home/blends/caffe-decaffeinato.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lavazza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.peets.com/decaf-house-blend.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Peets&lt;/a&gt;, ...

&lt;p&gt;For more on the subject of decaf coffee, see &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/120/how-is-decaffeinated-coffee-made"&gt;this question about how decaf coffee beans are produced&lt;/a&gt; and another question about the fact that &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/120/how-is-decaffeinated-coffee-made"&gt;decaf coffee still has a little caffeine in it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of "half-caf" coffee has become popular, mixing part decaffeinated beans with part regular (not-decaffeinated) beans, which might be a good option in your case to reduce (but not eliminate) the caffeine. These half-and-half blends are also available from retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What am I doing wrong if the used grounds in the filter basket are like wet sand?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a relatively cheap (&amp;lt;£100) espresso machine. Sometimes I find that after making a drink, I remove the handle and find the filter basket has lots of water in, so rather than tapping out a dry, compacted lump of coffee grounds into the bin, I have to wash a sloppy mess down the sink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get it right, but I haven't worked out what I'm doing inconsistently to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have seen this happen due to the age of the coffee being used. I believe that fresh coffee, something roasted within a week of use may cause the soupy puck you are experiencing. The rule of thumb is if the coffee tastes good, don't work about the puck. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What makes Brazilian coffee unique compared to coffee from other countries?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Can you tell me what makes Brazilian coffee unique?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Brazil is unique in that it is the largest producer of coffee, but it is also unique in that it produces a huge volume of dry processed coffee.  Dry processing is not unheard of, but is much rarer in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dry processing produces a coffee that IS different than most other processing methods. The coffee tends to roast differently and also produces much more chaff when roasting.  It also tends to have a different flavor profile than the same coffee processed differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many countries or regions will espouse the benefits of their method of processing, but there are other factors that greatly affect the reasons for choosing a particular method.  High humidity or rainfall areas will generally have a hard time dry processing coffee.  More labor intensive methods may be unfavorable in areas where labor is not had cheaply.  Water intensive methods will be undesirable in frequent drought areas or areas where water is expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil is somewhat synonymous with dry processing.  My roaster has a line on it for "Brazil" coffee.  What it really means is dry processed coffee.  Filling the roaster with dry processed beans past the line will overload the unit's ability to get rid of chaff as fast as it is produced and ruin the roast.  But even in the equipment manufacturers world, the two mean the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What reasonable diet substitutes for coffee cream are there?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; cream in my coffee. I can only stomach black, when it's excellent, properly brewed and so on. But at work I have no conditions for making excellent coffee - I make do with decent brand instant (lyophilized), I still need cream for it, and I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; coffee to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And recently I went on a diet. I switched from sugar to stevia, and it's acceptable. But I still use cream for the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the cream awfully cuts into my diet efficiency, so I'd like to switch it to some diet-compliant alternatives that will still make the coffee palatable, not a watered down slop, remain low-calorie and hopefully not cost an arm and a leg (even in spite of how rapidly would &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; reduce my weight) or require overseas shipping (to Poland).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are my options?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I can relate to this. I often home roast, and always do pourovers, so I am used to great coffee. Pretty much the only time I put creamer/etc into coffee is bad coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had good success with adding hot chocolate mix into bad coffee. You can get fake sugar versions of this, which are zero calorie (and come in convenient little packets), and they will make bad coffee considerably better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure about Poland, but I suspect you can find something similar there.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the purpose of a coffee press?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;At one of my local cafes, you can order your drink in a coffee press. It looks like a large mug with a pump on top:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2IFI0.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2IFI0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is this used for? Does it affect the taste or strength of the coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press"&gt;French press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put ground coffee inside it, pour hot water, stir a little bit, and then wait for 2 to 4 minutes (or longer if you want a strong and bitter coffee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After waiting, use the pump to filter the ground from the coffee and pour the coffee into your mug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend using coarse or medium ground coffee, otherwise, the coffee will go through the filter and will end up in your cup (and mouth).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Used Keurig smells and tastes like cigarettes</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was recently given a used Keurig from a relative. Unfortunately this person was a heavy smoker. I ran vinegar through the machine as well as removed and rinsed the little cup that holds the k-cups, but it still smells and tastes like tobacco. What can I do?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;First of all, note that the smell of the machine itself is unlikely to come from the interior of the parts that heat and transport water -- after all, they are regularly cleaned with hot water and smoke has a hard time getting there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So running vinegar through the machine won't change that. Rather, it is the other surfaces that cause problems. Thoroughly cleaning &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; surfaces of the machine may help a little bit (including the easily accessible ones behind the cover), and storing it in a room that is thoroughly aired for some months should also help to some extent. Depending on the temperature, a garage may also be an option. You need to be careful to not break the machine during cleaning and airing, though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!!!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;After some time has passed and no one answered, yet. Maybe I can come up with an answer. The question is not clear and if I understood correctly, the answer is too broad. Therefore, I will try to elaborate my answer by summarizing factors that effects &lt;em&gt;the tag&lt;/em&gt; of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Please leave comments as this is a quite broad answer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The species&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we say coffee, we mention two different species of &lt;em&gt;Coffea&lt;/em&gt; Genus. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Coffea arabica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_canephora" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Coffea canephora&lt;/a&gt; (aka robusta). They have many differences. Shortly, Arabica grows in the mountains, more expensive and has more oil (so flavor), less caffeine. Robusta grows in the seaside, less expensive and has less oil (so flavor), more caffeine. More detailed discussion can be followed under &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/116/what-is-the-difference-between-robusta-and-arabica"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The origin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You grow this plant in different places. Location and cultivation affects the taste. So, the origin has effects on the flavor. You may hear "Ethiopian arabica" or "Indonesian robusta" quite often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it comes the blend. After the harvest, the fruits are collected, dried and the beans are picked. When you collect different beans from all over the world, you blend them. Sometimes, single origin beans are used to taste the flavor as it is. Sometimes, they are blended to mix the effect of a variety of beans. Blends may be all arabica, all robusta or mixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Roast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the blend is prepared, roasting starts. During roasting normally up to 15% of the beans weight is dried out. This process is one of the main decisions based on personal preference, blend structure and the targeted drink. A list of coffee roast varieties can be found &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_roasting" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Note that there are also unlisted very very light roasts as in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2432/how-to-create-green-coffee"&gt;green coffee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The grind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grinding is also closely related to the targeted drink. For example, the coffee must be as fine as powder for preparing Turkish coffee. On the other hand, such fine grinding is so unpractical in French press as the grains could easily travel through the filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Brew&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose a brewing method. As a subtitle, use proper equipment for that method. Master your brewing method. Needless to say, there are (probably) hundreds of them. I could enlist three main methods as: pressurized extraction, thermal extraction, and cold-brew methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a questionnaire, baristas in Italy state that even pouring the espresso may affect the flavor. Apart from that, it is a known fact that the espresso cups must be pre-heated for a better experience. So, even serving the coffee is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The freshness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus article to the aforementioned ones, freshness. One should take car of the freshness of the coffee at each step. The beans themselves must not wait for years. After roasting, they should be degassed for two to three days before grinding. However, they should be consumed right after the grinding. There is a famous expression on that: &lt;em&gt;the customer not the espresso must wait&lt;/em&gt;. In one experiment it is shown that, if one day old ground coffee is used, the foam volume of espresso is 35% less than the one prepared by freshly ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I determine the origins of coffee beans in a blend?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is there a method exist to understand the type of the beans in a blend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, I will be glad if I can find a quantitative way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to determine the origins of the beans in a blend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;or if this is not possible,&lt;/em&gt; to determine whether the beans are from Africa or America (or Robusta)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;if possible,&lt;/em&gt; with relatively easy gadgets that I can find at every house. No gas chromatography, FT-IR, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, any other suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The short answer is no.  Short of genetic testing, it is near impossible to determine the origin of beans.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be able to make an educated guess at the whether or not Robusta beans are in the blend based the shapes of the beans and caffeine content.  But that would require a trained eye as as there is a great amount of variation in beans and it might be possible to mix up robusta, natural peaberrys, etc.  Robusta will raise the caffeine content, but depending on the blended amount, it may be hard to detect.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Effect of Sugar on Perceived Bitterness in Coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Food and Function&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.geek.com/science/sugar-changes-the-chemical-structure-of-tea-and-coffee-1630074/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sugar changes the chemical structure of tea and coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this effect of sugar in water on coffee solids to be trusted? I like some coffees black (pourover, drip) and some never without sugar (espresso drinks, Aeropress) and sometimes with evaporated milk or cream. I work at a coffee shop as well. Some have said that sugar counteracts bitterness in coffees (I assume due to caffeine). Does this supposed scientific backing have any credibility?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you are asking whether the science can be trusted, I would say yes.  The effect is already well known.  You even understand it insomuch as you apparently don't drink more concentrated brews (espresso, aerpresso) without a "masking" agent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this study is doing is finding a more specific reason for the already acknowledged effect.  People commonly believe that sugar or salt "masks" the bitterness from caffeine.  This study is saying that sugar or salt are not just masking the bitterness, but actually changing the chemical properties of the caffeine in solution, thus changing the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why is coffee mostly hot brewed?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is coffee always made with hot water ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there is iced coffee, but even in this case, coffee must be made with boiled water before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My simple coffee machine heats water into vapor, then rises it to the top of the machine to fill the filter and turns to coffee. It's obvious that it's impossible to do this with cold water and a traditional machine. But if it was, would the taste be the same as of a cooled traditional coffee ?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at what turns coffee grounds and water into coffee:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's an extraction process where aromatic compounds and oils and caffeine are extracted from the coffee bean into the water. It's a "standard chemical process", done in millions of kitchens and cafés all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic chemistry will tell you that the temperature of the solvent and other environmental parameters like pressure typically determine how fast this happens, but also the ratios of extracted substances, if applicable. Surface area comes into play as well, that's why e.g. coffee for espresso machines is ground finer than for filter machines. Using the same batch of beans in an espresso machine and a drip coffee maker gives you two &lt;em&gt;totally different&lt;/em&gt; taste profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same applies for extraction processes that use &lt;strong&gt;cold water&lt;/strong&gt;, a method termed "cold brew" and &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/search?q=Cold%20brew"&gt;discussed on this site&lt;/a&gt; as well. By the same rules as explained before, this means you need significantly longer extraction times (we are talking &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt; here) and should expect a different taste.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What makes a successful coffee shop?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I would like to open an artisan coffee shop in the next three to five years, I have a few ideas which will set it apart from other specialty shops.  However, when coming up with a business model, how should an owner weigh the product that is being served to its customers?  Is it more about the experience and atmosphere and quality of the product? I have zero background in business modelling or development, but would like to get a few pointers in terms of moving forward with this.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You're going to have to understand the market of the local area of where you intend to have your coffee shop. When starting out, I highly doubt people from miles away would travel just to receive a cup of coffee from your shop. So before you've been able to establish a brand you'll need to start somewhere, and that is providing for the local community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unfortunate observation of mine is that it seems as though there is a majority of people who do not actually know what a good cup of coffee is like nor do they care; it's all about the caffeine fix or the environment of the shop itself. Very few people will be extreme critics of the quality of your coffee and depending on where you wish to be located you may be targeting the busy commuter that pops in to get his fix, or the chill artist that wants a relaxing environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Target your local area and find out what people like and what ideal direction you want your coffee shop to be going in i.e. do you want to open more stores elsewhere? Do you want to become a brand that also roasts it's own coffee and makes blends? Know what direction you want to go in should help mold what your coffee shop evolves into and what type of customer you will target.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Should I press the coffee into my espresso machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The other day, I was watching an interview with an award-winning barista about how he prepared the award-winning cup of coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he was putting the coffee into the coffee basket, he was also using some kind of stamp, saying that the best pressure to apply is 22.5 kilograms when pressing onto the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I was not doing anything like that until then. When I tried (because the award-winning barista is doing it), my espresso machine could not handle the amount of coffee I did put in there and instead of a coffee stream was producing coffee drips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to the question - my home espresso machine (Kenwood Kmix) should handle 16 bars of pressure, but is far away from professional device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should one apply pressure when filling coffee to espresso machine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if yes, how much?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The process of compressing the coffee powder in a portafilter of an espresso machine before pulling the shot is called &lt;strong&gt;tamping&lt;/strong&gt;. There is a lot of information available on the web explaining how it is done correctly, such as, e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.coffeeresearch.org/espresso/tamping.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tamping is an important part of making a good espresso shot, so yes, you should press the coffee in the portafilter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for compressing the coffee powder is to allow the pump to build up the pressure needed for brewing espresso correctly. If you don't tamp it, there is typically not enough resistance and the water rushes through the portafilter too quickly, resulting in underextraction of the coffee powder (and hence, suboptimal taste). Furthermore, a good tamp prevents &lt;strong&gt;channelling&lt;/strong&gt;, where the water does not flow well-distributed through the coffee powder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the coffee drips too slowly when you tamp, a couple of things can be tried:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tamp with less force. The correct pressure depends on the coffee powder, the diameter of the portafilter, etc. - so 22.5 kgs may simply not be right for your combination of machine and powder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grind your coffee less fine - this will lower the resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change your beans. In my experience, lighter roasts cause more resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options two and three are only listed for the sake of completeness - normally the tamper force is adapted to the other variables, and not the other way around. A good espresso making tutorial should give you a starting point on how to find the correct tamping force and grind coarseness level for your combination of beans and machine. Also, if you own an espresso machine and never heard of tamping, you may want to read one anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are important factors to consider for a bean-to-cup machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm advocating for my office to purchase a bean-to-cup coffee machine to replace an auto-drip machine. &lt;strong&gt;What factors should I consider before suggesting a particular bean-to-cup machine?&lt;/strong&gt; I'd be happy to hear anything from general warnings to full-fledged product recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary hope is for this to be as pleasant and pain-free as possible, both for &lt;em&gt;consumers of the coffee&lt;/em&gt; (e.g., produces a good cup), and for &lt;em&gt;maintainers of the machine&lt;/em&gt; (reasonable to service/maintain). This is for a small office, "medium duty" -- perhaps 100 cups per day. I'm hoping to avoid pod-based machines, for less waste and better freshness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm primarily interested in drip-strength machines, but perhaps this is a terrible idea for this kind of machine. I hoped that there might be a small number of obvious choices, but I'm seeing a dizzying array of offerings. I fear that I'm missing something crucial. Noise? Quality? Ease of cleaning the hopper? User-empty-able bin? Quality of grinder? ...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have experience with particular machines? If you've used these machines, what is the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; feature about the machine in &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; office? Are there other important considerations that I'm missing?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Some major factors for consideration:
1) Manufacturer and warranty - with more integrated parts I've had to return or replace my fair share of these (and finally moved to separate machines for better taste and performance at the cost of convenience).
2) Capacity - how much are you brewing and for whom? 
3) Adjustability - ability to vary the grind based on the bean / strength of coffee you desire.
4) "Cleanability" - how easy is it to disassemble the machine to clean it - with these integrated machines it is essential that you break them down and clean them frequently to maintain good taste and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>french press technology stalled?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Looking at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press" rel="noreferrer"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, I'm stunned that there are no real technological advancements with the French press.  I've seen the aeropress, and it's interesting, but why has the French press itself not changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, the plunger has multiple pieces, allowing grinds to get between them.  What prevents the invention of a better press?  (I can't imagine much of an improvement to the beaker, outside of using a plunger like the aeropress.)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;What do you mean by improve? French press is one of the most popular brewing methods in the world, and rightly so: it's dead easy to operate and produces a great cup of coffee. The mechanism is very simple and easy to clean, a good french-press pot will last years if not decades, and if any part of it breaks it's cheap and easy to replace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What improvements might you make in general? Control over the brew is probably the most important, and with French press is there really anything you could add? The plunger separates the grounds and the coffee very effectively in a good pot, so not much room for innovation there. The other main variables: grind and timing are beyond the scope of the actual pot. In terms of maintenance and ease of use, the pot is optimal already too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could argue that the Aeropress &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an improved French press, since the brewing method is similar, especially if you use a metal filter. But it's more of a faff to use, doesn't scale so well (you can get 12-cup Cafetières), and tailored much more to the coffee enthusiast than the average person who just wants a cup of what the know and like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; A cafetière is already optimal for making French press, there's no room for significant innovation, beyond inventing new ways to brew coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Volume of water to 2 grams of instant coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I picked up a pack of Kenco Millicano 2 gram sticks to take to college with me because the coffee at the college doesn't taste great and is €1.50 for a tiny cup, so I was wondering in your experience what would be an acceptable volume of water for this mass of coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Those sound like single-serving packets; &lt;strong&gt;they are probably intended for a single "cup" of coffee -- somewhere between 150mL - 250mL&lt;/strong&gt; (5 fl. oz. - 8 fl. oz), depending on how strong you prefer your coffee. Volumetrically, instant coffee is usually on the order of 5-10 mL (1-2 tsp) coffee powder per cup, and this sounds like it's about the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd suggest starting with 150mL / 5 fl. oz. and try it. Add more water as necessary. Or, in the event that you like it even stronger, use less water next time. For a strength more like mass-market coffee, you might get up to 350mL cup (10 or 12 fl. oz.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aren't there directions on the packet or box? Seems like there should be. If so, I'd use those instead. :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Doppio vs. Short Black: What's The Difference?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across an &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-all-the-different-types-of-coffee-drinks/answer/Peter-Baskerville" rel="noreferrer"&gt;answer on Quora&lt;/a&gt; that describes the many different espresso-based coffee drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the author's answer, he defines a doppio as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Double Espresso or twice the amount of coffee and twice the amount of water.  Basically it describes two shots of espresso in one demitasse container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then goes on to define a short black:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A pure intense Italian favourite with a biting crème head.  Contains 75ml of pure double shot (2) coffee essence made from 24gm of fresh ground coffee beans.  Traditionally served in glass and is referred to as Espresso by European customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any difference between the two if they're both double shots of espresso served in a glass container?  Or is a short black a technical term referring to a specific ratio of coffee to water?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, a short black is a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; espresso, as in it's literally just another word for a single espresso. A short black is a single 30ml shot, and a doppio is two, 60ml. Nothing added to either, and the vessel you're serving it in varies by where you are, and doesn't change the name in any case :-)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>how to make French Press coffee the right way?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'll start by saying I'm pretty much a newbie to making coffee, and in the French press brewing which is why I joined this forum to learn. After reading a number of posts/info and watching videos on Youtube, 
I've tried a few techniques but I still think I haven't quite grasped it.
My main issue is once I have let my French press settle for 4 mins, the ground coffee on the bottom looks exactly the same as when I first put it in about 2 heaped tablespoons. I know it isn't instant coffee but I also read in a post at limiting the amount left at the bottom. This is where I'm getting confused. How much ground coffee should be left after letting it sit?
My french press is a Bodum 12 oz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that you read a few posts on the Internet the wrong way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The grounds will not disappear, if anything they will appear "more", volume-wise because they swell in the hot water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two points about "grounds on the bottom":

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the bottom of your &lt;em&gt;cup&lt;/em&gt;, indicating a too fine grind of the beans or a hole in the filter mesh. Some very fine "dust" is ok, though. This is french press, not filtered coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee sitting on the grounds after pushing the plunger for too long can negatively influence the taste of the last cup, making it excessively bitter, for example. So drink / pour the coffee shortly after you finished brewing. The time threshold depends on your beans and personal taste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Coffee ground sieves: Can they make a noticeable change in the flavor?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have seen a kickstarter project lately, named &lt;a href="http://thegadgetflow.com/portfolio/rafino-coffee-sieve/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Rafino&lt;/a&gt;. It claims to include a set of fine sieves to separate ground coffee into finer levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it may be beneficial, mostly for Turkish coffee and in general, to systematically determine the levels of grind for any method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would sieving or separating coffee do to the final flavor of the cup?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In all coffee-brewing methods, consistency is key. Different particle sizes of coffee will extract at different rates and controlling extraction rates and replicating them is part of making better and better cups of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rafino seems to be tailored more towards the filter or french press brewer. In these brewing methods, fines, the smaller coffee particles produce the majority of the problem in extraction and off-flavours produced in the end cup. With filter brewing, it restricts water flow and can cause inconsistencies in the extraction. With french press, the fines can overextract due to the full immersion process and cause a lot more bitter flavours to be present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filtering out inconsistent coffee grounds results in a much more evenly extracted coffee as the majority of grounds will extract more uniformly without any under or over extracting much more than the rest. This should give a much more balanced and bodied cup assuming other variables are as diligently controlled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better grinders can minimise fines but an extra step can ensure particle size consistency. However I'm not sure about the extent of adverse effects of exposing ground coffee to air for so long would be to which I would suggest minimising grounds-sifting time.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Are ghost-burr grinders better than conical burrs?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I would like to know if ghost/crushing burrs produce better particle uniformity than conical burr grinders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost burrs are particularly not so popular in the US, but some notable brands are from Fuji Royal in Japan, and some steel-manufacturing companies in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conical burr grinders are used by Breville and Baratza (at least the most legitimate ones). I particularly use the built-in grinder on my Breville, and the uniformity is great, but I'm attracted to the ghost-burr grinders by Fuji Royal and Yang-Chia (amongst other competing companies in Taiwan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone owned either of these kinds of grinders?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In theory a hybrid burr set where a flat burr is followed by a conical burr would be ideal, combining advantages of both burr types. In practice though there are many confounding factors in grinder design and world class grinders can be found with all types of burrs. Some of the best grinders in the world made by Ditting is Switzerland use large precision flat burrs rather than conical burrs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conical and hybrid grinders are more expensive to manufacturer and are therefore less common in cafes. But that is not to say that a conical grinder like the Mazzer Kony /Robur is not a superb grinder just because it's flat disc burr brethren vastly outnumber it. It can be said that conical burrs are seen more often in higher capacity grinders. Some other well regarded commercial burr grinders include Cimbali, Mahlkonig and Bunn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice though there are many confounding factors in grinder design and world class grinders can be found with all types of burrs. Some of the best grinders in the world made by Ditting is Switzerland use large precision flat burrs rather than conical burrs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can be said is that industrial production roller mill grinders put all of the burr grinders to shame, producing the best particle size uniformity of all. However these room filling behemoths, with similarly large price tags are impractical for use in cafes or even small to medium scale industrial coffee grinding where burr grinders dominate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer the question posed then, no. Peg discs do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; produce superior  particle size uniformity than true burr grinders - conical or flat disc. Quite the opposite in well established by myriad reputable sources and can be seen in plots of particle size distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flat (non burr) disc grinder crushes /fractures coffee beans in a less predictable manner than precision burrs that have a more consistent and more sharply delineated size reduction path. Excessive fines can be thought of as unwanted dust arising as a byproduct from a less precise size reduction&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to make lattes with plant milk</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have just bought a VonChef Milk Frother. I am not sure if I am doing something wrong but the following happens when I put milk into the machine up to the maximum and press go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hemp - it just seems to heat to a lukewarm level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rice - it doesn't froth the milk and heats to a lukewarm level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coconut - it overflows after like 30 seconds with froth and the milk isn't warm enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are my dreams of preparing tasty rice milk lattes not going to happen or should I rather get a Nespresso Milk Frother?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You need a high-protein plant milk in order to obtain proper froth as the froth is kept in shape by what are essentially entangled protein molecules. According to google, rice milk only has ~10% of cow milk's protein, which explains why it doesn't work well. Soy milk has pretty much the same percentage of protein as cow milk, so that is worth a try. Coconut milk has ~70% of cow Milk's protein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the heating: try a different setting of your frother. Heating should work the same no matter what milk you use.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the cheapest way to use coffee beans?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been given two large bags of a popular brand of coffee beans, I would like to buy a machine to use them but do not want to spend a lot of money, is a standard coffee filter machine suitable please?  I have heard I might need a grinder? Many thanks&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; ways to brew coffee, and several that are on the "inexpensive" end of the spectrum. Your tone sounds like you're not &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; into coffee, so to that end here are my broad recommendations in that will give you an adequate cup with minimal fuss and expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You'll need two basic pieces of equipment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A grinder&lt;/strong&gt;. You can buy an inexpensive electric rotary grinder that will be adequate for most purposes -- one example &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00006IUX5" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. You can also use it for grinding spices or seeds. If you already have one, you will get &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; odor holdover from one grinding mission to the next, but it's probably fine if you're not very picky. 10-15 quid new, or even cheaper used from a thrift shop etc. You can even mash them up with mortar and pestle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some brewing mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;. The cheapest and simplest are probably &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_brew" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;drip brew&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., pour-over or auto-drip), but I online a few more down below. Your options are manual pour-over (my recommendation) or auto-drip:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual pour-over&lt;/strong&gt;. My pick would be a manual pour-over coffee cone, &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0014CVEH6" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;such as this one&lt;/a&gt;, a plastic cone holder for like 5 quid. You put the cone over a mug, put in a paper filter, add medium-grind coffee (even as fine as the rotary grinder will give you will be okay), and slowly pour water over the top until brewed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto-drip&lt;/strong&gt;. You can find a really cheap auto-drip machine, &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001NXC5YC" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;for instance this one from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, for like 10-15 quid, or even cheaper used. Water goes in the reservoir, paper filter in the basket, add some ground coffee, press the button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's one solution for decent cup of coffee for as little as 15 quid all in (grinder, coffee cone, paper filters), or perhaps 25-30 for an auto-drip solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See also questions tagged as &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/pour-over" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;pour-over&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;pour-over&lt;/a&gt; for how-to information.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there any way to preserve roasted coffee beans?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I know different people try different things to preserve roasted coffee beans, including freezing them or vacuum sealing them. But do any of these actually work? I have a very rare and expensive coffee bean that I'd like to take out once a month or so on special occasions, and I'm trying to see if there's anyway to do this without buying the coffee new every time.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coffee beans, once roasted, are perishable; they don't "keep". Within roughly five days of roasting staleness is detectable (taste/quality is adversely affected). There is one way to preserve freshness: consume freshly roasted beans within roughly a week. Don't freeze; beans absorb moisture and lose flavour— ick. Vacuum packs aren't the answer, either. To remove all gases from packaging would require a system using pressure, 29" Hg, that no one, not even coffee giants, can afford. The best practice is to just buy beans (roasted on the day you purchase, ideally) in quantities you'll use within a week to 10 days. &lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Chicory was added to coffee in order to stretch the supply of coffee because it was in short supply and expensive. Though it doesn't taste exactly like brewed coffee, chicory has a similar flavor profile and for some the flavor is complementary. Today, chicory use is predominately due tradition, as is the case here in Louisiana where many, especially in the more southern region of the state, prefer their coffee include chicory.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What/when/how do you consider coffee as organic?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Our shop joined this bazaar and we we're selling roasted beans (Brazil Santos) which we get green then roast in our shop. A customer was asking questions about the coffee beans and the only one thing I wasn't able to answer thoroughly was: "&lt;em&gt;Is this organic?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What coffee is organic?&lt;/strong&gt; or should I say: How or when do we consider a certain coffee to be organic?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You were most likely right in saying 'no' straight out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee is considered organic if no chemical substances were used for its production. This includes herbicides, pesticides, and I believe some fertilizers too. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; agrees with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if you're a coffee producer and you're sure you don't use chemical substances and there are no residues in the soil, that's not enough. You have to &lt;strong&gt;certify&lt;/strong&gt; your product and you'll be able to say that your coffee is &lt;em&gt;certified organic&lt;/em&gt;. The certification process and agency will depend on where the coffee is grown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the certification costs. And some producers might not afford it (thanks to &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/users/76/chris-in-ak"&gt;Chris_in_AK&lt;/a&gt; for pointing this out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you're only roasting the beans and not producing them, it's not really up to you (you could ask your provider if the beans they're selling you are certified organic). But you could buy beans that are certified organic.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Extending the Japanese Brewing Method to Espresso</title>

Does adding ice to a cup, so the espresso hits the ice immediately, give a similar effect to the Japanese Brewing Method?&lt;/p&gt;

Espresso is concentrated more robust in its taste profile while the Japanese method is &amp;quot;more delicate with a lighter body&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to make coffee candy to eat later?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When I drink coffee with my stomach not very full, I usually don't feel very well later on. Because of this, I tried to start eating the coffee instead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to make some kind of coffee candy with just sugar and coffee, sometimes I try adding some oil, but it's not getting in the way I want it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using raw grounds into it (When I'm lazy I just eat the grounds with sugar ^^'), and I wanted it to become more solid, kinda like chocolate, but from coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm doing for now is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melting sugar in low heat with very little water, mixing the grounds in the molten sugar, then let it cook for some time while mixing it, and then I take it out from the fire into a plastic container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried mixing the sugar and the coffee before melting too, and I've tried mixing some oil on it before and after melting the sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do anyone know any recipe for this, preferably with the raw grounds?&lt;br&gt;
(I made some research, coffee grounds have lots of anti-oxidants fibers and other good things, so I want to keep using it xD)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I was at a new restaurant in my area the other day, and they had this ingenious little snack: &lt;strong&gt;Chocolate-covered coffee beans.&lt;/strong&gt; The beans are left as they would be just prior to grinding them into grounds, and covered in a layer of chocolate, with a nice crunch to them. It's really as simple as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been working on finding them in local supermarkets. Gourmet and specialty grocers such as Trader Joe's or Whole Foods might have them; I'm not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it common to put honey in coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I heard from people in France and Bulgaria that people sometimes use honey to sweeten coffee (mostly older people).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it common in some cultures to use honey? Or is it just some individuals doing it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I confirm MT San's point on availability. Sugar has become a commodity, but in the past, it was a luxury item. This luxury trait remains with high-end cane sugar, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past people either dos not know about powder sugar, or could not afford it. They used instead honey, maple syrup, or other locally (so cheaper) available sweeteners. This habit remains for some people, usually older, as they have started in their youth, and that became their personal standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly honey can be more expensive than sugar today. Sugar is now a major commodity, and the price is really well "engineered". Honey has lower circulation, and the prices are comparatively high. But now the Elderly may have better incomes too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, no citation here. This is personal observation of my relatives, and a parallel with chicory, which originally replaced coffee in "poorer" regions of some countries, and the custom remains, even though the regions may not be "poorer" anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Good quality espresso / cappuccino maker that doesn't leak or break within 18 months of use</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been buying de Longhi coffee machines for a while now and they seem to be getting worse.  I started on a Delonghi EC152 which was low cost and pretty reliable.  Then when my 2nd one died, I tried to order a replacement but it had been discontinued and so equivalent model was a EC146.B which was really poor.  As luck would have it, or so I thought, I received another de Longhi as a present, an EC 270.  But this leaks like crazy after only a few weeks.  If you fiddle with the valve on the  water vessel it stops leaking for a few  hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I would like to buy a coffee maker which doesn't leak and which will last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willing to spend a reasonable amount to get something that will last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking for a home use machine for say 1-2 cups per day.  Our cooker is an electric hob - so not sure the stove types would work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions would be most appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could anybody identify this device and know how it functions?&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It looks like an old syphon or vacuum coffee brewer.  The coil on the bottom vessel heats the water to boiling and is forced up thru the center to the top vessel where the ground coffee is placed.  Two interesting things are what looks like a plug to seal the pour spout in the center ring to hold in the pressure and something I haven't seen is a sealed top vessel that has what looks like a whistle to the right of the lid.  I guess that is to let the person know when the water is completely in the upper chamber and the coffee has started to steep and to turn off the heat so the bottom vessel can cool drawing the brewed coffee into the bottom vessel.  Clever idea if it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to judge time between cracks when roasting</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just roasted beans at home for the first time and have a question about the expected timing between cracks.  I roasted 1 cup of beans in a &lt;a href="http://www.crateandbarrel.com/stovetop-popcorn-popper-black/s497401?a=1552&amp;amp;campaignid=206278616&amp;amp;adgroupid=13795205936&amp;amp;targetid=pla-56128534817&amp;amp;pla_sku=497401&amp;amp;scid=scplp16373921&amp;amp;adpos=1o1&amp;amp;device=c&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjw6am-BRCTk4WZhLfd4-oBEiQA3ydA3uOqhoXcTUslYTnmy0Ly2QOdh0i_ysy-RyKBlW1sA44aApwF8P8HAQ" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Crate and Barrel stovetop popcorn popper&lt;/a&gt; on the side burner of my outdoor grill with the heat on high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I had researched ahead of time, I was expecting to hear the series of first cracks, then pause of a couple of minutes, then faint cracks.  Instead though, the first cracks started around the three minute mark and continued for the next four minutes.  I can't tell if the second cracks ever started, since the sound never stopped from the first round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The color and texture of the roasted beans is close to other store-bought beans, but they smell burnt.  I kept thinking I should take them off the heat but thought it might be too early and I hate weak coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should there be a space of time in between cracks?  Does this sound like I had the heat up too high?  I was stirring constantly, about one turn every 2-3 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Distinguishing between end of first crack and the start of second crack can be very tricky. A lot has to do with the variety of beans being roasted and your heat application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I think happened to you was that you lost control of your heat. At first crack your beans become exothermic (give off heat) and you didn't reduce your heat. What happened then is that you had too much heat at raced through the "development" time in your roast profile. 
To correct this you should reduce your heat at the start of first crack and develop the flavor by how much/long  you let the beans go for before taking them off the heat.
This is a critical time for your roast because your are developing the flavor in your roast by time and roast level. How you apply heat changes from variety to variety and darkness. 
Take the time to read up on roasting theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a good basic guide: &lt;a href="http://coffeeforum.org.au/roasting-how-to-do-it/a-basic-roast-profile-guide-for-home-coffee-roasters/" rel="nofollow"&gt;A basic roast profile guide for home coffee roasters.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Sealed or non-sealed immersion cold-brew</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What's the difference (pros/cons) on brewing full-immersion cold-brew (resting at the refrigerator by night) hermetically sealed (closed mason jar) vs non-sealed (opened mason jar, Toddy, french-press, etc) ?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is just a guess, but I suppose using a non-sealed container would speed up oxidation and deterioration of the coffee due to continuous exposure to atmospheric oxygen, just as storing the dry beans in an open container would. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, from my own experience, 12 to 24 hours of such exposure would not yield a perceptibly different taste. What's more important is that you store the finished product in a sealed container, preferably with as little air as possible (I use a water bottle). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, also in my experience, cold-brewing with a french press is more convenient, since one can simply push down the plunger and pour the finished product as opposed to lengthy fumbling with filters.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There may be some advice on this. My first will be to check the pressure as you can do this with your pretty machine. Please check if you are around 9 bars when pulling the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason of delay is, it takes a while for the water to wet the grounds. So, it is normal to wait for a few seconds to see the first drops. However; if it is more than a few seconds, the most possible problems I can think of are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pressure is not enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have tamped so forcefully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The grind is too fine&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Why does instant coffee foam when stirring it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have seen that when preparing coffee without milk (just water and coffee), instant coffee (at least Nespresso) foams when stirring it just a bit. However, regular coffee grounds do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does someone know the reason for this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have noticed the same thing. I believe it occurs because minute gas particles in the instant coffee, trapped during &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/411"&gt;the production process&lt;/a&gt;, are suddenly released. This gas (air or something inert) rises to the top and bubbles or foams. It dissipates immediately, unlike crema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think it's caused by any physical chemistry stuff, like heat from dissolution or any actual reaction, though I do notice it more with very hot water. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How should I get the most flavors from my coffee in different temperatures while drinking?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I seem to notice that once my coffee has cooled down significantly, then I am able to taste a wider range of flavors. Am I the only one experiencing this, and is there a way to get different/more flavors while the beverage is still hot?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Interesting question.
You are not alone when noticing flavor differences with different temperatures of coffee. When cupping coffee in a controlled lab situation for Quality Control purposes, I will often make multiple passes through the cups to taste the differences that are present as the coffee cools. Doing this tells me/us what we need to do while roasting to highlight/change the flavor profile of the roast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high acidity/brightness of a light roasted Kenya disappears as the cup cools. The darker roasted coffee that will show more "sweetness" at a high temp will show off more as it cools. These are but two examples. Other flavor characteristics that are found in roasted will definitely change as the coffee changes temp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of what you are tasting is perception. Here is a link to the key being how our taste buds translate it to our brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science/Food-temperature-affects-taste-reveal-scientists" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Food temperature affects taste, reveal scientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the coffee is roasted the only thing you can do to change the flavor profile of your coffee at high temperatures is changing the brewing method. All the variables in brewing will without a doubt change the flavors that you perceive.
This will lead you to experimentation to find the flavors that you want to see.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Recommendations for tasty decaf coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am currently attempting to decrease my caffeine consumption and was therefore wondering whether anybody has experience with decaf coffee? Although I want to reduce the caffeine, I don't want to compromise on the taste. The decaf options that I have tried so far were disappointing, such that I was hoping somebody else had any specific brand recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;When we werekeeping our caffeine consumption low, we used to brew a 50:50 mix of normal and decaf.  Both were at the good end of what the supermarket sells ground, and were a nominally similar roast.  The overall efect was like slightly less good normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could probably progress to something like 25% normal in decaf, especially if the normal was a slightly richer flavour than the decaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could of course step all of this up a level by buying beans to grind yourself or buying small quantities of freshly-ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used Cafe Direct decaf for this.  I've since given up on that idea and have my last coffee of the day just after lunch, so this was a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Consequences of wrongly cleaning espresso machine with vinegar?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I use a small and simple espresso machine (&lt;a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=krups++model+963&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwil_KSA19PQAhUBJcAKHY_UBAoQ_AUICigD&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=612" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Krups Model 963&lt;/a&gt;). Yesterday, I wanted to decalcify it and (being a rather unexperienced "barista") did what I usually do when decalcifying my water boiler: I poured vinegar concentrate, diluted with water, into it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Afterwards&lt;/em&gt;, I wondered whether this might have been a bad idea and started some Google research. I found out that many people discourage the use of vinegar for decalcifying coffee machines because the vinegar may damage the cauldron. This seems to be of particular concern if the cauldron is made of aluminum, which seems to be the case with my machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the cleaning and some iterations with pure water I tried to make some espresso. I didn't notice anything wrong so far: The machine seems to work well, espresso tastes good (or: as usual). The only thing that worries me is that when running the machine with pure water (without espresso powder in the sieve), I noticed some small white particles in the hot water coming out of the machine. These &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be just chalk, but I also read that it could be part of the inner coating of the cauldron which has been dissolved by the vinegar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;strong&gt;I wonder whether it is still save to use the machine or not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I wonder whether&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cauldron could be damaged so severely that it may explode?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the produced espresso could be toxic due to aluminum or parts of the cauldron's coating leaking into the espresso?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice is appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'll answer as a chemist and not as a coffee expert, but occasional exposure to vinegar won't substantially damage a piece of aluminum. Also ingesting traces of aluminum &lt;a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=1076&amp;amp;tid=34"&gt;isn't toxic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Dragon curve floating on freshly brewed coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;As a PhD student in mathematics, I like my coffee - quite a lot. But I'm also poor (because, duh, I'm a PhD student), so my funds available for coffee are pretty limited. In order to still be able to have a decent cup of coffee, I decided to invest in a nice hand grinder and an Aeropress - figuring it would pay for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here I am, hand grinding coffee beans, a local barista recommended, brewing what I consider to be surprisingly decent coffee and still - something is wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My coffee - for some reason - has a dragon curve floating on its surface!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately - being in my office - I am not able to take a picture of it. But it comes really close to an actual dragon curve, posted below for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cy7PD.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cy7PD.jpg" alt="Dragon Curve"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dragon infested office clearly isn't suitable to work on ones thesis and hence I sit here, wondering about dragon curves and what might cause one to show up in my coffee cup instead...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technical details:&lt;/em&gt; I'm using a fine - but thin - paper filter in my Aeropress and some blent of mostly Arabica coffee for my beans of a medium grind size. It seems most likely to me that the dragon curve I observe is made of lipids - especially since Arabica (according to a quick internet search) seems to contain a decent amount (~15%). That, however, doesn't explain its fractal appearance. I've seen lipids floating on coffee many times before, but as far as I can remember, they just formed boring puddles or were entirely absent (maybe due to using a thicker filter). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I welcome any attempt, preferably backed by published research, to explain this distracting phenomenon as well as pictures of similar curves formed by lipids on liquid surfaces (preferably coffee).&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's probably not a dragon curve, but the fractal projection of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brownian motion&lt;/a&gt; of coffee lipids on the surface of your tasty beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brownian motion is best explained by statistical physics. Small atoms or molecules collide each other continuously in very high speeds in the liquids even if they seem serene. However, as the total effect (average) of these collisions are quite stable, we see a still surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The small particles, which are very light in mass, can be affected by these collisions. So, they may move with respect to these collisions. So, you can observe these collisions as &lt;strong&gt;Brownian motions&lt;/strong&gt; if you put some very light powder or lipid on top of the surface of a liquid. Very probably, this is what you have experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fractals_by_Hausdorff_dimension" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you can find a very comprehensive list of fractal sketches, including the ones related to Brownian motion. Do any of them look similar?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I produce better espresso shots with my Gaggia Classic?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just bought an espresso machine, Gaggia Classic.I tried making an espresso from pre-ground coffee with the pressurised filter (Crema Perfetta) that comes with the machine and I found the coffee was extracted quite fast. For example, within 10 seconds I already get 30 ml of espresso from 7 grams of pre-ground coffee. Despite having beautiful crema, the coffee tasted sour. Did I do anything wrong? The dosing I used was generally recommended for a single shot of espresso, but I used the 2-cup pressurised filter instead of the other smaller one that's said to be for PODs. &lt;strong&gt;Question 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Any recommendations for getting a better shot of espresso from these things that I already have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also would like to try the non-pressurised filter selling online as it's claimed to produce better quality espresso. I have learned that this kind of filter is commercially used with commercial machines that generate the brewing pressure at 9 bars. But my Gaggia classic is 15 bars, based on the specification document. &lt;strong&gt;Question 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Will this higher pressure result in faster extraction when I use a non-pressurised filter? I have learned that there are other factors that help slow down the extraction time such as tamping and grinding size, but &lt;strong&gt;Question 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Will these factors be significant enough to overcome the 15 bars? I don't want to modify anything in the machine like adjusting the brew pressure of which the method is shown on the internet.Thank you for your comments and answers. I'm totally new to making espresso myself, but I really love espresso.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The standard parameters of producing a decent espresso is previously discussed here: &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2959/what-are-the-standard-espresso-parameters-dose-mass-volume-time-etc/2960#2960"&gt;What are the standard espresso parameters (dose, mass/volume, time, etc.)?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from this answer, assuming that you have a semi-automatic home type espresso machine, if you want to stick with pre-ground coffee and cannot change the grind size, all you can change is the following three:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tamping&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dosage is more or less stable in between 6 to 8 grams. Time is mostly the variable that decides either you produce a spectrum of drinks from ristretto to cafe creme. Thus, you should study on tamping. Illy suggests 20 kgf vertical force. But I assume your home-type machine may not handle such tight pellets. So, try to find the best by experience. (By the way, such devices are designed as 15 bars, but while they are in action they are automatically regulated to 9 bars.)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How long does it take coffee beans to degas?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;A google search brings up a great article by Hannah from Fellow Products called &amp;quot;Understanding Degassing: Is Fresh Best?,&amp;quot; in which she claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Degassing varies depending on the type of coffee and roast. It therefore can take anywhere from 2 to 12 days until the coffee is ready to brew. Some rules of thumb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 24 hours is when a bulk (approximately 40%) of CO2 leaves the bean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darker roasts usually degas faster than lighter roasts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer roasts usually degas faster than faster roasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is anyone aware of any other research on this topic?  Can anyone corroborate, or does anyone disagree?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Degassing is discussed a few times. The most cited answer in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Coffee SE&lt;/a&gt; is probably &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/6/why-is-it-not-recommended-to-drink-coffee-immediately-after-its-roasted"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Degassing takes up to 2 to 4 days to achieve drinkable coffee. If you really want to shorten this, grind earlier. But you should try yourself for best timing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best flavor is around 1 to 2 weeks. Again, you should follow your taste buds based on the beans and the roast degree.&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>How do flavors like vanilla and hazelnut get into coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was at a local coffee shop today and I noticed for the first time ever that they served vanilla coffee. This surprised me, as I had not yet ever seen coffee with vanilla flavoring, and got me thinking about how that comes to be. Could anybody help me with this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In a coffee shop (assuming both places like Starbucks or non-chain versions), flavour syrups are a staple. Some have &lt;a href="http://store.starbucks.com/cat/more/syrups-and-sauces/"&gt;their own range&lt;/a&gt;, others use &lt;a href="https://www.monin.com/m/products/top-10-flavors"&gt;generic manufacturer's&lt;/a&gt; that are also used in other cooking or bartending applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd assume a dash or two of these are added to your coffee and voilá: Vanilla (hazelnut/caramel/...) coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option are &lt;a href="http://www.folgerscoffee.com/coffees/ground-coffee/hazelnut-coffee"&gt;flavoured coffee beans&lt;/a&gt;, but for a coffee shop, that's pretty unlikely, as they would have to keep various beans at hand and switch between orders. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much weight reduction occurs after roasting coffee beans?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Does the roasting process lead to weight reduction? If so, what are determining factors? type of coffee? type of roast(dark, medium etc) ? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have X lbs of unroasted coffee beans, how much (average) roasted coffee beans you get after roasting?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The roasting process leads to water loss in all types of beans. Most beans start off at about 10-12% moisture and end up around 3%.
My experience gives about 15% weight loss (shrinkage) for light roasts and around 20% on dark roast profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of a dark roast weight loss in my roasterie would be: 
Starting weight: 240#
Roasted weight: 195#
Shrinkage = 195/240 = 81% of start weight so 19% loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't seem to find any online documentation of this. Just daily experience of being a professional roaster.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee is going to be extinct by 2050, some claims by 2080</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;This is very general question but I have read many articles stating the "extinction of coffee" but all are with very different perspectives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is discussion question, as this question doesn't have a straight forward answer. I will like to know the views and explanation behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I am coffee lover, I can't take the trauma of it being "gone"&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A web search for &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=coffee%20going%20extinct" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;coffee going extinct&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; finds many articles, e.g. in Business Insider, Aug. 30, 2016, &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/coffee-shortage-climate-change-2016-8" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;A coffee shortage is looming — here's how soon it could be extinct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the global coffee supply is currently at risk, with shortages already starting to affect the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;half of the world's area that's deemed suitable for growing coffee will be lost by 2050 if climate change remains unchecked, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://fairtrade.com.au/%7E/media/fairtrade%20australasia/files/resources%20for%20pages%20-%20reports%20standards%20and%20policies/tci_a_brewing_storm_final_24082016_web.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;according to a new report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;a href="http://climateinstitute.org.au/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Climate Institute of Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2080, the report estimates that wild coffee (which helps us find genetic varietals that might be more resistant to climate stress) could go extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperature and heavy rain have helped a fungus called Coffee Leaf Rust spread through Central America and into South America, destroying crops. Pests like the Coffee Berry Borer are spreading for the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a half a degree of temperature change can make a region that used to be a coffee gold mine unsuitable. Moving production to higher altitudes is not always feasible and can be especially difficult for the small farmers that make up 80-90% of coffee growers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2050, half of currently suitable land will no longer be suitable, unless the world can limit warming to the 1.5-2 degree Celsius rise that was set as a goal at the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement, and really, even 1.5 degrees is pushing it for most farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 120 million people in more than 70 countries rely
on the coffee value chain for their livelihoods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many countries where coffee exports form a main
plank of the economy are also amongst the most
vulnerable to climate risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crop adaptation strategies include developing more
resilient production systems, diversifying crops,
and shifting plantations upslope. The global trend,
however, is towards intensification as producers
seek to lift yields at the expense of more complex
and carbon-rich landscapes. Ultimately, climate
change is likely to push many producers out of coffee
altogether.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Magazine, Nov. 16, 2012, &lt;a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/16/coffee-under-threat-how-wild-arabica-could-go-extinct/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Coffee Under Threat: How Wild Arabica Could Go Extinct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee grown on commercial plantations, like many other crops grown to produce high yields, lack genetic diversity — and are thus highly susceptible to disease. Wild Arabica, which makes up just 5% of Ethiopia’s coffee crop compared to other kinds of coffee, is thought to account for over 98% of the coffee bean’s gene pool and has an estimated value to the coffee industry of almost $1.5 billion per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If disease or climate change causes a die-off of commercially grown Arabica, it’d still be possible to re-engineer it from a wider genetic pool — which is why wild Arabica is so precious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <title>What am I doing wrong when I do my pour-over?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently started to brew my own coffee using the pour-over method because buying from the coffee shop was getting too expensive for a daily coffee drinker. I bought a bag of coffee grounds and a coffee dripper online. The dripper is a stainless steel type with a couple fine mesh filters in it, which lets me do pour overs without a paper filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's my method: I'm putting 3 tablespoons of grounds into my dripper, and then with a kettle of 17oz, just off the boiling water, begin pouring over my grounds with enough water to fill the dripper half full. I wait 10 seconds while the grounds bloom and then I fill the dripper to the top and wait for the coffee to brew. Then, when the dripper gets about half empty, I fill it back up with water. I intend to end with ~16oz of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem is that the grounds end up plugging up my dripper and the drip process ends up taking forever. By the time all the water has passed through my coffee grounds and dripper the coffee is COLD!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I doing wrong? Am I trying to get too much coffee out of the pour-over method? Is it really only meant for a single cup serving? Like 6oz and 1 tablespoon of grounds? Are my grounds not fine enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;
Despite what everyone is saying here, I've done a little research and I've read that when doing pour overs, you want your grind to be more fine. They say the consistency of sugar, not sea salt. I find a little truth to this in that when I originally bought the dripper, I used a bag that had grounds that have been much more fine that what I've been using lately. Needless to say, I think I just need to experiment with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TtHWN.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TtHWN.jpg" alt="coffee dripper"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You need to use a coarser grind.  You have grounds that are just the right size to block the mesh. Too small and they'll just pass through, making your coffee gritty.  Medium-sized and they'll block the mesh.  Large (coarse) enough, and coffee can flow around them.  Not too large: you won't be able to extract enough from the beans with this brewing method using very coarse grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are you grinding now?  If you're using a blade grinder, you'll often get a large variety of grain sizes (from very fine to very coarse), which means those medium and fine grains will start to clog to holes, even if much of the grounds are coarse.  A burr grinder will give you more consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would recommend a plastic or ceramic pour-over brewer, which uses a paper filter.  This method is much more forgiving.  Paper filters won't get clogged with medium grains, and fine grains won't pass through.  I can easily brew 8-16 ounces with my "single-cup" pour-over brewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last suggestion: Give your bloom more than 10 seconds!  60 seconds will give your grounds enough time to fully bloom and become ready for further brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to avoid coffee grounds in my cup with a Bialetti?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When I make coffee with my Bialetti, there is a bit of coffee grounds in my cup. Is the coffee too thin ? On the package is written that it is fine for the Bialetti machine. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The reason is that your coffee grounds are too fine. Your &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_percolator" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Percolator&lt;/a&gt; needs coarser grains for various reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowing water trough it more easily – else the pressure needs to go too high and your coffee will taste burned as it is roasted a second time from the overheated filter basket &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not allowing small small grounds to "whirl" up in the water and reach the top &lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; and flow into your final coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this and if above does not help, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; —if needed— still go with what @Ecnerwal suggested as a last ressort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; You can avoid a good part of this by using very warm (non boiling) water, instead of cold water. This means the water will boil earlier and the grounds will not get exposed to too much heat over a longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Do not over–power your stove. When I cook my coffee, I turn the (electrical) stove to between level 7–8/12. Using a lower heat not only makes the coffee drinkable and removes a lot of the overly strong and often bitter taste, but also prevents smaller grounds to whirl up as the water has less energy, moves less and allows smaller grounds to sink back into the filter again.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What causes the stains around the cup when coffee is prepared with cafetiere (French press)?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When I use my French press (cafetiere) coffee maker, there's these strange marks left around the top of the coffee cup (see picture). Am I doing something wrong, maybe blending incorrectly? Using the wrong coffee type maybe?&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRBg2.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRBg2.jpg" alt="how it looks"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I could think of two possibilities. First one is more common, I assume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In time, the cup calcifies. So, some irregularities causes an unpolished surface. This surface catches color easier than polished ceramic/porcelain. You may try to clean the cup with vinegar. Maybe then with some bleach to get rid of such calcification and organic irregularities. Give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the grounds you use includes finer grounds that can pass through the filter, you may end up with a muddier-than-normal French press cup. Those fine grounds may swim on top of the water and leave some trace. If this is the case, make sure about your grind size and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Water temperature for Aeropress: inverted vs tradional</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering why the aeropress directions call for water that is between 165~175 °F (73~79 °C)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always though that water should be between 195~205 °F (90~96 °C).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I've read a few things and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KakEQiQzNUo" rel="noreferrer"&gt;watched some videos&lt;/a&gt; that make me think if you are using the inverted method of brewing with the aeropress that your water should be hotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anybody have any experience or want to through their thoughts in on the subject? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This page on &lt;a href="https://angelscup.com/blog/taste/coffee-extraction-sour-vs-bitter/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Angels' Cup&lt;/a&gt; has (see the middle of the page) a concise summary of the key variables and results in brewing coffee with a given method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it tastes &lt;strong&gt;sour&lt;/strong&gt;: The problem is &lt;strong&gt;under extraction&lt;/strong&gt;, so adjust brew time &lt;strong&gt;longer&lt;/strong&gt;, or adjust water temp &lt;strong&gt;cooler&lt;/strong&gt;, or adjust grind size &lt;strong&gt;finer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it tastes &lt;strong&gt;bitter&lt;/strong&gt;: The problem is &lt;strong&gt;over extraction&lt;/strong&gt;, so adjust brew time &lt;strong&gt;shorter&lt;/strong&gt;, or adjust water temp &lt;strong&gt;hotter&lt;/strong&gt;, or adjust grind size &lt;strong&gt;coarser&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temperature affects the sour notes significantly more than the bitter notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… you have to be willing to experiment. Don’t think of it as a waste of beans. Gulping coffee without paying attention to flavor is a waste, experimentation is the best possible use of good beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried varying the grind size and water temperature in an AeroPress, and so far my results agree with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I've found that brewing medium roast beans with 175°F water (using a calibrated thermometer) produces coffee that's not sour, while higher temperature water often produces sour coffee (tasting a bit like vinegar). The company recommends 175°F except with light roast beans, in which case some people prefer 185°F water. See &lt;a href="https://aerobie.com/aeropress/faqs/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;their FAQ&lt;/a&gt; about temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not tried varying the brew time. The &lt;strong&gt;inverted method&lt;/strong&gt; lets you increase the brew time but you can accomplish that without the mess by inserting the plunger, pulling back slightly to decrease the pressure below room pressure, then waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that the brewing variables are interdependent. That probably explains why people using the inverted method to brew longer would use hotter water to compensate for what would otherwise be over extraction. (I don't know why cooler water extracts more than hotter water.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal brew time, temperature, and grind size will vary with brew method. AeroPress immerses the grinds in water, thus it's relatively insensitive to grind size.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can you use sparkling water to brew coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Has anyone ever tried it yet? What flavor/mouthfeel/extraction benefits are there, if any?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you heat the water as per most brewing methods, it would no longer be carbonated/sparkling by the time you brewed with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would thus be confined to a cold-brew method, and if you wanted the water to remain carbonated you'd have to cold brew in a sealed container. That would be moderately inconvenient but should be possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you could brew coffee by any means and force carbonate it after the fact, which would thus have no effect on the brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never tried it, don't find the idea personally interesting, but all it should cost you to try would be a bottle of sparking water and the hassle of getting the coffee grounds into it, waiting a day or so, and then pouring it out through a filter and cleaning up the mess before recycling the bottle. Please report your results.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>D.I.Y. Pour Over Coffee Maker</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a friend that wants to try a pour over coffee but she doesn't know if she wants to invest in another coffee maker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you think you could just use your standard drip coffee maker to hold your grounds and use a kettle to pour water over the grounds and get the same results?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should work since there is no magic involved in the pour over coffee maker. The only problem could be the pressure from the wet coffee on the 'arm' holding the coffee since it was never made to keep the coffee in midair. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It wouldn't be expensive to get only the coffee dripper ( I got a plastic one for 2 euro, fancier porcelain once come for 10 euro as far as I know). With them, you apply the same principle you mentioned. Boil water, pour a little on the coffee to let it soak, wait 1 minute, slowly pour the rest of the water on the ground ( be careful not to push the coffee away with the water) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trough the result might differ due to the plastic, which could give a little different taste.&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Amount of money I should spend on a Grinder</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I currently have a Chemex, a Aeropress and a bialetti espresso Machine(electric espresso machine, bad quality). I use mostly the aeropress and the Chemex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grinder is a Hario manual grinder. I want to get an electric one.
How much should I spend, minimum, on a electric grinder so I can get a good grind for my brewing methods?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Depends on if you want to be able to grind true espresso grinds.  My daily grinder I received as a wedding present and it suits me just fine, a Cuisinart for about $40 dollars.  If I want to grind for espresso, this is completely incapable of doing so, so I ended up getting a $180 dollar unit that is capable of timed grinding and grinding to espresso level grind.  This unit is a Breville with a cone burr, which I honestly really like because it doesn't have the static of the Cuisinart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very much a personal choice type of question.  If you have $10000 burning a hole in your pocket, I'm sure you could find a grinder to match, or if you are worried about keeping the lights on, you could probably find one to suit your needs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few recommendations..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low End:&lt;/strong&gt;
Cuisinart DBM-8 -- Does good coarse grind, to a reasonably fine grind.  Drip brewers and pour over are right in the middle of its standard grind range.  Biggest con is it is a flat disc grinder and generates quite a bit of static so be aware that it will make a bit of a mess.  Cannot grind espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid Range (150-250)&lt;/strong&gt; -- The Baratza Encore is really popular and a pretty good price.  It has conical burrs and gearing specifically intended to reduce static and heat.  I personally use a Breville Dose Control Pro which is about the least expensive grinder I could find with the portafilter holder and timed grinding.  Thus far I've been happy with it, low static, very very fine grind level for espresso if needed, but I am seeing some reviews about how the internal components tend to fail after extended use.  Someone may be able to comment on the feasibility of the Encore for espresso grind better than I.  Breville can grind espresso, someone please comment on Encore / Virtuoso espresso grind capability!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Range&lt;/strong&gt; --  The sky is the limit here.  You could go with a higher end Baratza going all the way to the 1000 dollar range and probably higher, if you've got that $10,000 dollars burning a hole in your pocket you could go big with a 60 lb EK43 (and then send me a big tip!).. just kidding.  The EK43 runs about 2500 and is a shop grinder, although it is now a barista favorite for competition.  When you start getting into the super high end machines, personally my favorite is Mahlkonig but really.. there's no reason for this caliber of grinder at home.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, how much to spend is a tricky question.  I would say a minimum of $40 and a max of however much you want to spend.  If you have the money, and want a solid reliable workhorse, I would probably go with either the Baratza Encore or Baratza Virtuoso.  Baratza is one of the higher quality, and popular home grinders that don't completely break the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there any process after roasting coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;We use coffee beans after roasting. Can we use it directly after roasting? Is there any further processes after roasting the coffee beans before being used for consumption?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Typically after roasting coffee there is a rest period during which you don't want to use the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly 85-90% of carbon dioxide contained in a coffee bean after roasting will be released in the first 24 hours.  You CAN immediately brew coffee with fresh roasted coffee, but the flavors will not be fully developed, and you might get a metallic taste in your brewed coffee which is a side effect of the carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my shop, we allow the coffee to rest for 12 hours before grinding for the customer, and we don't cup coffees until they have rested for a minimum 12 hours.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are some coffees that benefit from longer rest times.  Some recommend up to 10 days rest time for espresso because you will get higher extraction yields (tds yields) after a long rest period (per Scott Rao who is an expert on the subject).  Other coffees like some Ethiopians will develop more pronounced floral / berry flavors after a slightly longer rest period of around 5 days (recommended by Joe Marocco over at Cafe Imports if I recall correctly)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than this rest period and grinding, there is no process that needs to be accomplished after roasting coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much coffee grounds do I use for a large percolator?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;For the 10th year in a row, I have charged myself with the duty of brewing coffee for parish's Fall Festival.  Usually, I am provided with a giant tub of Folgers and told I might want to rinse out.  They also give me a little card that says how many "perks" I'll get out of every cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of coffee maker I'm talking about, you put the coffee in a metal hopper in the pod and water splooshes out the middle and burns you when you try to open it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sEEhV.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sEEhV.jpg" alt="Coffee Maker"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've got 3 coffee makers: I can't remember the exact sizes, but I think they vary between 35 and 100 cups. I usually make a pot of regular in the big one, a pod of decaf in the medium and a backup pot of regular in the small one.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to purchase big bottles of filtered water for this endeavor and also to get fresh ground beans from a local roaster the night before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really want to know is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the actual cup-to-coffee ratio.  I know 1 Tbsp to 6 OZ and could do the math (But that's like 8 Cups of coffee grounds for 100 cups of water which I believe is chest-hair territory)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the ideal ratio, how far can I deviate before I sink into bathwater territory? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of ignoring &lt;em&gt;volumetric&lt;/em&gt; measures and using &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially for a huge pot like this one, any old kitchen scale should be precise enough to allow a good dosage (for just a cup or two, you need more precision). The general recommendation for filter coffee is &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;60g coffee per 1000g water &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And remember that 1000g =1kg = 1l.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the "bath water territory", I admit that I have gone down to "1 heaping teaspoon per mug", which translates to ca. 7g per 200-220g or 30-35g per 1000g. That's pretty close to what aficionados call "bath water", but I'm sometimes a whimp when it comes to filter coffee. 
If you are dealing with the average crowd of American (weak) coffee drinkers (sorry for bashing the cliche here), I think you can easily go down to 50g/l or even slightly below without the majority even noticing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as you are working with a small local roaster, I suggest you get a small sample beforehand and run a little test. Note that his coffee might (should!) brew differently from the supermarket sawdust. You might want to choose the right roast if you're going to lower the ratio. Tlk to your roaster: Factors that should be kept in mind are the type of machine and the fact that the water will probably be very hot, so the selected roast should be able to withstand it somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the grind will be important, but "medium" should be a good starting point. If your machine needs coarser grounds, you will have to increase the coffee by 5-10% to get the same result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, even if you did some test runs at home and think you perfected every parameter, that kind of machine you will be using is not designed to maximize the coffee quality, but the output - that's just how it is. The results should still be significantly better than "get a few cans of [you know which brands] and boil them to death with chlorinated water". Most of your guests will enjoy the fête and the community and pay only little attention to the coffee - they will taste your effort and appreciate your dedication nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And if you do all that to make sure &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can have a decent cup of coffee at the festival, I still think that's worth it!)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Espresso machine fish tank smell</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just purchased a used Expobar Office Pulser it came with a very strong smell fish tank or algae smell. What does that mean and how do I get rid of the smell? The water passes through the machine with no trouble and is clear when it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You've got colonies (of bacteria, and perhaps algae.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd be looking for something a bit stronger than vinegar or citric acid in the sanitizing line, though either of those might be a good place to start, just to clear out any calcium deposits that other things might be using as a growth substrate (attaching to.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your preferences, and/or any information you can find about what is recommended for your machine, this might be bleach and water, or one of several choices from the (beer) brewing products such as PBW (powdered brewery wash), Star-san, or Idophor. Star-san (at least) will also attack calcium deposits (it's mostly phosphoric acid.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rinse well, many times, when done.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to tell if coffee beans are burnt?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I bought a bag of whole bean "Medium Dark" coffee from a café which recently started roasting its own beans. To my taste it is awful, however am unsure if the coffee is burnt or just not to my taste. I am considering returning the beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What ways are there for telling if coffee beans are burnt?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Char - smell and taste. Excessive oil coating the surface of the beans. The extracted coffee will have a flat taste. Hard to describe, but the taste will be predominately "charred" and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cracking a bean open may help, I don't think it should be black through and through, but I don't have any experience with that.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Running an empty grinder</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;To always have fresh coffee I put in the grinder only the amount I want to drink at that moment.
Then I just grind until no more coffee comes out - but that causes the grinder to run empty for a few seconds every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can it cause harm to the grinder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the Rancilio Rocky (without doser)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;No it's not a problem. Producers know that people at home often single dose their coffee, so I assume they consider that when producing a grinder (in fact most coffee shops that do pour over grind single doses as well). Maybe in some manuals it's written that you shouldn't let it run empty on very fine settings, but that's more to avoid warranty claims than because it would actually hurt your grinder and I assume they are referring to letting it run for minutes on end, which you probably shouldn't do. And why would you? The burrs in any case shouldn't touch each other at all, even on fine settings (or only at the flat part of the burrs, but certainly not the blades). I have yet to seen a grinder that was getting damaged due to the few seconds of running empty after your dose went through.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the clear plastic sticker on New England Coffee bags for?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I got a couple bags of New England Coffee and noticed there is a clear plastic sticker with 9 holes in it on the front of each bag.  It seems like there are also small holes in the bag underneath that correspond to the holes in the sticker, but they are very small.  Also the sticker is very sticky (i.e. it is not meant to be removed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know what purpose this serves?  Is it for freshness somehow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sticker is always in the same place, and can be seen here if you zoom in and look closely.  It's Under the words "Chocolate Cappuccino", and its center is in the sky underneath.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Good observation in both meanings. Yes, the transparent thing is for freshness. It is a one-way valve for the coffee to release redundant CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas out of the package.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've read online that removing the sleeve of the pannarello wand and just using the inner rubber as a wand can create better micro foam, I was excited to try as I couldn't get my EC685 wand to produce nice foam for latte art. I've read that you need to release the pressure (purge) first before removing the sleeve. So I did. It worked for 5 seconds (and I can see it works so much better than with the sleeve). However...5 seconds later, the rubber flew into my jug and milk splashed everywhere. Has anyone had similar issues? Is it just not possible to use the EC685 wand without the sleeve?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have the exact same machine and the inner rubber wand is tightly attached. It doesn't come off even if I pull it firmly. If yours is falling off that easily it could be that either it is clogged (so the steam pressure is shooting it off), or it is lose (which you should be able to push it back in place) or it is defective (or missing a part). &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the history of coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm a coffee addict and curious about coffee. My question is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word coffee comes from? When was coffee discovered? Who have discovered the coffee? Who are the figures and from which countries the coffee is brought to the Asian continent? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; The great article of &lt;em&gt;Reginald Smith&lt;/em&gt;'s "A History of Coffee" is a must read for everybody who has interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the stories of coffee's discovery, which is more common than others is as follows: Kaldi, a monk and a goatherd, sees his goats gets excited after eating some berries. Then, prepares the coffee from the beans of the berries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second, less common one is as follows: Yemeni priest Ali bin Ömer banished to the mountains of Yemen. There he discovers the beautiful flowers of the coffee tree, then the beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etimologically coffee roots from Arabic ?ahwa (????). The root of Arabic word is unknown, but some say that it is originated from some poetic form of a word for wine as it is forbidden in the Arabic world. This name is more or less similar all around the world today: Turkish kahve, French cafe, Italian caffe, German kaffee, Dutch koffie, English coffee, Latin coffea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wild Coffea arabica is known to be cultivated in Harar valley of Ethiopia at earliest AD 850.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beverage stayed local for a while, then became known among Arabs. East Europe became aware of it through Ottomans; Especially Austria and Italy. Then, the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee was a very valuable asset even in those years. Therefore, strangers were not allowed to access green beans for long in the Arabian peninsula. Baba Budan, an Indian Pilgrim, was the first one who can manage to take out seven coffee seeds out of Mecca to Mysore strapped to his belly. Then, cultivation out of Arabian Peninsula and East Africa boomed.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does hydration level change the effect of caffeine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Apologies if this question does not belong here, it may be suit for the &lt;a href="https://chemistry.stackexchange.com"&gt;chemistry site&lt;/a&gt;, but it pertains to the consumption of coffee directly -&gt; so here it is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does your prior level of hydration have any affect at all on how much of a "buzz" the caffeine from coffee gives you? I spoke to someone who thinks it's the case that having drunk a glass of water &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; coffee sustains the effect versus it being the first liquid introduced into your system and the rationale behind that was since your body is not in need of any liquid the effect of the caffeine is somehow prolonged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side is that if there's nothing in your system and only the coffee, is it the case that its effect would be stronger since it would not be diluted with other things (e.g., water) in your system?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has anyone experimented with this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any difference at all?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some resources for explaining the biochemistry behind this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Definitely. This is why you get caffeine jitters when you drink coffee on an empty stomach. Caffeine is a diuretic so it makes you more dehydrated. It is recommended to drink water before drinking caffeine, because caffeine also increases stomach acid and can cause stomach pain.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;That will completely depend on the blend of espresso you are using.  Different coffees will have different pull times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience as a barista, you'll aim for about 28 seconds on most shots.  Some of the blends we've used aimed more at 25 to 31 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are the differences in perceived quality of Robusta vs Arabica bean blends?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There are many different varieties of coffe, but cafea arabica and cafea robusta are two different species grown in my region of Colombia, robusta specifically grown for its increased resistance to disease and pests.  But how are these two species differentiated in the quality of the prepared drink?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Robusta is often used to "cut" blended coffee because it is most often cheaper to purchase than Arabica beans.  Since it generally has a higher level of caffeine than Arabica, it may also be used to up the "kick" of blended coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robusta is generally though to have an inferior flavor to Arabica, partially because the extra caffeine imparts some bitterness, but also perhaps because of it's growing conditions.  While some very few places out there may strive to produce superior Robusta beans, they are working against a market that generally considers it an inferior product and will not pay as much for it.  Therefore less care is often given to Robusta plants and processing since the return on investment is lower. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Do flavoured coffee beans need to be brewed at a different temperature?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have in the past seen flavoured whole coffee beans on sale. &lt;a href="http://www.thebeanshack.co.uk/contents/en-uk/d2_FlavouredCoffee.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an example (though it was a roadside market stall where I saw them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you need to brew the coffee at a lower temperature, or otherwise prepare it any differently than you would do with unflavoured beans?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Here comes an unintentionally snarky answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flavored coffee and high quality coffee are rarely synonymous. Since flavored coffee masks the organic and natural flavors of the coffee itself, it's rare that a quality bean is used in the first place. Imagine ordering a &lt;a href="https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/the-glenlivet-18-year-old-whisky/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Glenlivet 18&lt;/a&gt; with Pepsi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ergo, I'd say that your brew temperature with a flavored coffee isn't extremely important. In the end, you're really just going to be tasting artificial (natural if you're &lt;em&gt;lucky&lt;/em&gt;) flavors that cover up the taste of the bad coffee underneath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I would say, however, is before you start using quality coffee after using flavored coffee, be sure to clean your equipment thoroughly. The flavors used in those coffees have a tendency to stick around long after they're gone.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;howstuffworks.com has complete directions for removing coffee from all kinds of materials. Here is what they say about Cotton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cotton and Linen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Follow these steps to remove coffee stains from Cotton and Linen:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blot up excess.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pretreat (the method of applying a stain-removing agent directly to    the stained area before laundering) with Shout Liquid Laundry Stain&lt;br&gt;
  Remover, then launder immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If that is not possible, soak the stain in a solution of 1 quart warm    water and 1/2 teaspoon dishwashing detergent for 15 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rinse well with water.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next, sponge the stain with rubbing alcohol.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rinse and allow to dry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the stain remains, use an enzyme presoak (follow directions on    label).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rinse well with water and dry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launder as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Another method that has worked:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stretch the stained area over a bowl and secure with a rubber band.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pour boiling water through the stain from a height of 2 to 3 feet.    Stand back to avoid splatters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Although cotton and linen can stand boiling water, some of the    finishes and colors used on the fabrics might be damaged by such&lt;br&gt;
  harsh treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be sure to test on an inconspicuous corner first. (If coffee    contained cream and any greasy stain remains, follow procedures to&lt;br&gt;
  Remove Milk and Cream.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  <title>Is decaffeinated coffee more acidic?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Apparently caffeine is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Chemical_properties" rel="noreferrer"&gt;weakly basic&lt;/a&gt;. This means, presumably, that in coffee the caffeine actually neutralises some of the acids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is decaffeinated coffee more acidic than caffeinated coffee as a result, or does caffeine only have a negligible effect on the pH of the brew?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;According &lt;a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/543945-acid-levels-caffeinated-vs-decaf-coffee/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this source&lt;/a&gt;, a study by Dionex, a part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, found that decaf coffee is &lt;strong&gt;less acidic&lt;/strong&gt; than regular coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, all coffee causes the stomach to produce acid and the scientific results of the effect of both types of coffee on this are inconclusive. Some studies have found that patients drinking decaf have less stomach acid issues and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://teeccino.com/images/uploads/pages/File/DECAF.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this source&lt;/a&gt;, the nature of the beans used to make decaf coffee are higher in acidity in any case, because these beans are used due to their ability to retain flavor after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, decaffeinated coffee beans have less acid in them than their counterparts, but because the choice beans for decaffeination are already high in acid, this may make most decaf coffees have a higher acidic content in general when compared to other coffees.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How would the ratios of iced coffee differ from regular coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;If I'm making iced coffee, should the ratios of the ingredients (coffee, water, sweetener, milk) differ in any way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If so, how?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Recipes vary according to taste, but if you want a similar concentration ("strength") of coffee, you'll probably want to use a stronger brew of coffee (basically amounts to using more grounds). This is because you're diluting the coffee when you add the ice (which melts), even more so if you're trying to start with freshly brewed and very hot coffee (melting more ice). Here's a suggestion from &lt;a href="http://www.chow.com/recipes/30487-basic-cold-brewed-coffee" rel="nofollow"&gt;Chow&lt;/a&gt; and a discussion from &lt;a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/05/whats-the-best-way-to-brew-iced-coffee.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Serious Eats&lt;/a&gt; that discuss the methods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, though, I prefer the result of cold-brewed coffee. Rather than brewed-hot and served-cold, it's both brewed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; served cold. I think the cold-brew extraction is a better complement to the cold service. Furthermore, less ice might be needed to cool the beverage to a similar temperature, which is an added bonus. See the myriad questions with &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/cold-brew" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'cold-brew'" rel="tag"&gt;cold-brew&lt;/a&gt; for more on that subject. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for milk/cream and/or sugar/sweetener, this seems to be entirely personal preference. I take mine black, so I'll let others comment on that. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Which vitamins &amp; minerals does coffee provide?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've heard that coffee contains small amounts of several vitamins/minerals and even worse, it can interfere with iron absorption and wipes out B vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does coffee has any vitamins &amp;amp; minerals which are essential to life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In example: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Coffea arabica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Here are some nutritional information for brewed coffee that list macro- and micro-nutrients such as those you list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;from &lt;a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beverages/3898/2"&gt;Self&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/?q=nutrition+information+coffee"&gt;Google search page&lt;/a&gt; includes nutrition information from USDA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like there are traces of various B vitamins, a fair amount of riboflavin (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and traces of minerals such as magnesium, phosphorous, and potassium. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this nutrition data will certainly depend on the origin, roast, preparation methods, and other factors, which affect what gets into the cup from the beans.  Unless you're eating the beans...&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to follow Aeropress instructions when water filters through too quickly</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When I try following the Aeropress instructions (2 scoops coffee, fill to level 2, stir for 10 seconds, press for 20 seconds), I find that all the water has filtered through before I get to even 10 seconds of very gentle pressing.  Most of the filtering takes place while I'm still stirring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I doing something wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using pre-ground coffee (Tesco decaf).&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It sounds as though the pre-ground coffee you are using is not ground fine enough. Generally the more coarse the grind, the faster water will filter through.   You may try throwing some additional grind on your coffee, or buy pre-ground coffee that is more finely ground (although a snob such as myself would never actually advise buying pre-ground coffee).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Should I use weight or volume when measuring doses?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My pour over/drip coffee pot recommends that I measure 10-12g of coffee per person whilst my grinder has markings to indicate whether the ground amount is for 1 or 2 cups. I notice that darker roasts being slightly more oily seem to weigh more and therefore the volume is less compared to a lighter roast so the question is which method of measuring is correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that taste is subjective and I have been using 11g so far but given the variability in weight and volume is there a correct method which perhaps can be adjusted for different roast types?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In cooking in general weighting dry ingredients would be much more precise and give you greater control over your variables.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>In terms of taste, what is the correct way to produce a full cup of coffee using an AeroPress?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When I made my first cup of coffee with my AeroPress I couldn't help but notice that it only filled my cup half way. I've watched a few videos on YouTube of people using an AeroPress and from that I've build a short list of ways you can top your cup off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just add plain water to top your cup off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repeat the entire process (new filter, new grounds and water)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once empty just add more water on top of the grounds that you just used. (This is the method I use.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In terms of overall taste, what is the best way to get a full cup of coffee from an AeroPress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;My personal preference is to just add a bit of water to top my cup off.  I do not use the inverted method, and by adding additional water during the brewing (since I tend to get just a bit of drippage during brewing) I tend to end up with pretty close to a full cup.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you are looking for a much stronger (pseudo espresso) cup, the second method may be for you.  It has only really the drawback of using an additional sum of coffee and filter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would not recommend using the 3rd method.  At that point you are just headed to over extracted grounds and a less desirable (by most people) cup of coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, you are looking at producing a cup sized quantity of good coffee with method one, a cup sized quantity of Aerpresso with the second and a cup sized quantity of likely over extracted coffee with method three.  Any of these may be fine depending on what you are trying to achieve.   &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Do Automated Pour Over Machines provide the same flavor profile compared to manual pour over method?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I use 2 manual pourover methods&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method 1: Brown Melitta #4 paper filter rinsed using my Bonavaita drip machine's brew basket. 185F filtered water and beans grinded with Baratza Encore burr grinder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beans from SquareOne, Intelligentsia, Novo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method 2: using a Hario V60&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been noticing several automated pour over machines coming to the market - Poppy Pourover, Bodum, Invergo, Kitchenaid and lots of others getting on the automated pour over bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are these automated pourover machines even worth looking into?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Several "automatic pour-over" machines have recently come onto the market from manufacturers such as those you listed.  They are something of a hybrid between the ubiquitous, conventional "automatic drip" machines and manual pour-over methods.  That is, the automatic pour-over machines attempt to perform the same sequence of steps recommended for manual pour-over, but in an automated fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, compare the &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Blue Bottle pour-over drip guide&lt;/a&gt;. This suggests a multi-step process of pouring. With water at a particular temperature, do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heat the cone and wet the filter;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pour a small amount of water to wet the grounds and "bloom", then wait;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pour the rest of the water slowly in the middle of the grounds pile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other guides recommend pouring in circular motions, or in multiple iterations, or at a particular rate, or in certain places.  See also the question about &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/339/pouring-technique-for-drip-pour-over-coffee"&gt;pour-over techniques&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular auto-drip machines, on the other hand, simply drop water in one go over all of the grounds in a somewhat uncontrolled manner.  This also relates to a question: does auto-drip taste different than pour-over? That's a separate, open question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article from LifeHacker gives &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/automatic-pour-overs-do-they-make-a-better-cup-of-coff-1583005950" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a comparison between the new-fangled automatic pour-over machines and how they compare to real, manual pour-over&lt;/a&gt;, and another from &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/16/ottomatic-chemex-coffee-brewer_n_6329320.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;HuffPo&lt;/a&gt; about the Chemex model. Their conclusions are varied (see article for more) but:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they're more expensive than conventional drip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some models have controllable settings for certain parameters (e.g., bloom time; temperature)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they provide precise repeatability for certain parameters such as rate, contact time with grounds, water temperature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, they provide attention to detail that can be done by hand; some do this better than others. However, most just heat water and drip it over the grounds somewhat better than a conventional drip coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don't want to learn the "style" or "art" to manual pour-over, or &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you appreciate the nuances of manual pour-over (over auto-drip), but can't quite focus attention on details that really distinguish manual pour-over,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;these machines might be for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Ideal Way to control shot extraction with Gaggia Classic</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Wanted to know if anyone has a really good, possibly verified method of controlling shot preparation and extraction with an unmodified Gaggia Classic espresso machine.  I don't have, nor do I want to add a PID.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is your method?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The best way to control of shot extraction without adding excessively complicated electronics (if by PID you mean proportional-integral-derivative controller) is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How fine is the bean grounding (the finer the grounding, the higher the density -&gt; the slower the extraction).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applied pressure on the grounded beans in the machine group head (the higher the pressure applied (similarly) -&gt; the slower the extraction).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pressure and temperature are also important parameters to be concerned before moving to PID control (for example your extraction time/lenght could be longer but if the temperature of the water is low, there won't be excessive essential oil extraction). &lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Quality of ground coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Recently I've had some amazingly bad coffee in local cafes, and this week I had the same experience with some ground coffee I bought.  I used a french press for that.  Watery, dark colour, bitter and hardly any coffee taste. Just to be sure I packed a moka express well and the result was awful, very dark and very bitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I know I should be using better materials etc., but bear with me.  This reminded me, not in a nice way, of long past attempts to get a second brew from filter coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is this just very poor quality raw materials roasted beyond the limit, or has the industry started to do something like extracting flavour for those capsules you see around and then roasting the heck out of the remaining grounds and selling them?  Maybe this sounds a bit far fetched, but the food industry has form.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;My first thought would be &lt;em&gt;stale coffee&lt;/em&gt; rather than commercial conspiracy but, assuming you live in North America, I don't blame you for that.  The time since roasting is important and, compounding on that, the time since grinding, thence finally how you brew it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So your questions should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What did I do different in the way I brewed this time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long since this coffee was roasted?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long since this coffee was ground?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't be afraid to ask the source when it was ground, and when it was roasted.  Time from roasting to now should be measured in days (not weeks), and time from grinding to now should be hours, minutes, or even seconds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the attendant cannot answer you it illustrates the fact that they don't know and you do care. Thence maybe one day you'll find a source where the attendant both knows and cares, so shop around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are different beans, different roasts, and different tastes. So, once all of the above is attended to, you may still, quite reasonably, conclude that the taste of that particular roasted bean is not for you. Again, exercise your options: go elsewhere, roast your own, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the endless search for something better.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to make Turkish coffee in a syphon?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been experimenting with my Syphon to make turkish coffee, my thoughts on the matter are that using the syphon without a filter would allow the water to boil, move to the upper chamber, let the vapor out, move back to the lower chamber and then boil up again... making it easy to do the three boils required for the turkish coffee. (plus it allows me to get around my lack of a proper Cezve) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I've been unable to find information in Google about using this approach to turkish coffee. So Im opening this question seeking to find information on using this approach, I would like to know if anyone else has experience doing something like this, or any online sources about it? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I, being a native Turkish and experienced Turkish coffee drinker for my life, quite conservative about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be some major problems on producing the genuine Turkish-style with a syphon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The extraction process is made by heat, not by pressure in Turkish coffee. So, syphon is not what it is intended for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two (or even three) times is quite correct during preparation. But boiling is quite wrong. Never boil Turkish coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A well-prepared Turkish coffee is layered. So, the grounded coffee subside at the bottom of the "fincan" (cup). Ideally, it never gets mixed in the drinkable layer of the coffee. (Those remaining grounded coffee is for the fortunetellers.) I assume, by moving coffee in between the chambers of syphon three times, you cannot settle the grounded coffee easily. So, it will fill into your mouth. This is undesirable.&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Will cold water result in cooler coffee with drip coffeemaker?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In electric drip coffeemakers, water is pushed up by boiling a portion of it at a time, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend told me that unless he uses warm of hot water in the coffeemaker tank, the resulting coffee will be much cooler. I find this very hard to believe as I always use cold water and the coffee comes out hot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the water will travel past a heating element, and steam "bubbles" will push the water on the top where it will "drip". BUT is it possible that in cheaper coffeemakers the cold water can slip past the heating element un-heated and travel up with the following bubble, cooling down the outcome? Is this where the watts will really come into play?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not asking if cold water should be used, but rather if such a scenario is possible. I do not have a precise thermometer or a cheap coffeemaker to test this. Also, I found this very hard question to google, as the only keywords I can think of are "cold, water, drip, coffee".&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I hardly believe this is directly related to coffee. Still, as a more than 15 year experienced engineer, I would like to answer this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is simply and clearly "no".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the water to be able to travel to the top of the drip coffeemaker machine, it requires to gain some latent heat by changing its state to gas phase first. That's It simply means, it needs to be vaporized first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, just at the top of the coffee and filter, there is a condensation space. At that space the gas (vapor) returns back to liquid phase (water) and starts to drip. Therefore, you obtain a slow flow of heated (to the near evaporation point) dripping water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot think any other way of bypassing this flow. Even in cheaper drip filter coffee makers.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are the guidelines for 'specialty' coffees?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;As I work in growing coffee, many people talk about the markets for different coffees.  While I focus on the sustainability of my coffee, many people have told me that you really want your coffee to be 'special'.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to figure out what this special means.  Some roast their coffee with peanuts or cacao bean for flavor, some claim that because they grow coffee on a very high mountain or an especially cold climate that their coffee is now 'special'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any objective criteria for specialty coffees?  Which specialties add the most value in terms of price?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are not any firm guidelines established for what constitutes a specialty coffee.  Theoretically no one would consider anything made by Folgers to be a specialty coffee, and anything produced by a small local roaster should probably be considered specialty, but there is a lot of gray area in between.  For instance, some people may consider the bagged beans Starbucks sells to be specialty coffee, others (myself included) would not. Specialty is largely a marketing term like "Cloud" is for computing.  "Cloud" is used ambiguously for private, public, small, large, closed and open platforms.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally I would define specialty coffee as something not produced and sold on a national scale.  Most specialty coffees are not "branded" by a company because they are bought in lots and sold sort of "as is".  That is, the roaster bought X amount and when they sell through it, it is gone.  This is opposed to a larger company that will always have "Sumatra Special" available for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start talking about roasting with other things, or adding flavors, you have moved to "flavored" coffee, which I personally would never consider specialty coffee.  Oils and additional flavorings may be well liked by many people, but they can also be used to mask the shortcomings of less expensive beans and are generally used to produce a consistent tasting product.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly when you start talking about growing conditions, it can vary, and doesn't necessarily mean anything.  You can have beans that come from the same lot differ widely even in processing.  There is no "perfect area" to grow coffee and good coffee can be grown in a fairly well defined, but still variable conditions.  Advertising that coffee was grown in a specific place doesn't mean it was properly grown, harvested, processed or roasted well.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How best to reduce tannins in black coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've traditionally had coffee with milk, no sugar. However I've recently switched to a diet that involves either reducing milk intake or switching to a milk substitute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to make the switch to black coffee, but I'm finding the tannins (metallic/coppery taste down the sides of my tongue) a little too much to bear. I use a coffee pod machine mostly, but I've also found this problem with espresso black coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do notice the 'tannic' taste more when the coffee has cooled, but I'm wondering if there are certain types of coffee bean, roast styles, or even serving styles that I could adopt to reduce it without introducing milk back in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: A few notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've had the same problem with almond milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introducing sugar is a no-go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://chemistry.about.com/od/foodchemistryfaqs/f/Does-Salt-In-Coffee-Reduce-Bitterness.htm" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Salt can reduce the perception of bitterness.&lt;/a&gt;
Sugar-alternatives can help too (stevia, et al.).
But assuming you don't want to add anything to your straight black coffee, I would change what you have control over. Brewing method and coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold brewing reduces acids extracted from the coffee, which reduces bitterness. AeroPress brewing extracts less than most other hot methods like a french press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For coffee, try out light roast or medium roast coffees, as these will have less tannins. You should also try out dry-processed vs wet-processed coffees, as those methods introduce different flavors to the coffee. Most dry-processed coffee will have a more stone fruity flavor due the the sweet cascara fruit flesh drying onto the beans.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Normally, the main reason that roasted coffee has a shelf life is its freshness. If the package is properly closed it is mostly safe. Your concern should be its flavor which should be faded away already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you must also think about the mold that may cover the beans. Mold may grow on coffee beans or ground coffee in time. It may cause allergic reactions according to &lt;a href="http://www.healthguideinfo.com/pollen-mold-allergies/p88147/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; or even more. &lt;a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_7807900_remove-mold-coffee-beans.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt; includes a guide how to remove mold from coffee beans &lt;em&gt;-however this method affects the flavor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;Because it is quite hard to take the basket out of the portafilter, I tend to leave it there. But this means I can't clean the space between them. Is that OK?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The space between them is very hot to be cleaned right after preparing the espresso, actually. It is better to wait for a while and then remove the portafilter to clean if you are not planning to prepare a second one right after. See image below from a manual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4JkRY.gif" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4JkRY.gif" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space in between can be cleaned after given number of use. E.g. after every 50 use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, I tend to use decalcifying agents after per 100-150 use. Then, I also remove the parts and clean thoroughly. Otherwise, I just wipe the space in between with a wet cloth.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Typical set up/menu for farmer's market coffee stand?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What equipment is pretty typical for a coffee stand at a farmer's market?  I would like to server pretty standard drinks including drips, pour overs, lattes, espressos, etc.  What are suggested menu items to have to really establish a clientele, but to also not go overboard on expenses, and what equipment is generally needed to open a stand?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head (by no means exhaustive):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A two-group double boiler espresso machine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want two groups in case something goes wrong with one of them, you're not out of business. You also want to be able to use the steam wands while extracting, so the need for each group to have a double boiler is pretty big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of one machine that costs a ton, you can get two machines (each with one group and a double boiler) that cost anywhere from $1000 to $3500 instead. Try not to go with home appliances - even though I have nothing but great things to say about Breville, they &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; designed for that kind of continuous duty cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redundancy is not all that's important, you need to be able to make more than one drink at a time :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;At least two burr grinders with dose control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dose control gives you consistency. And you need to be able to grind as many beans as you plan to offer without cleaning grinders each time. These can get insanely expensive as you get into features like auto tamping - the biggest thing to look for is accurate dose control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend a model that fires once you stick a portafilter under it, with a button to extract into a pitcher. They &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; come with a small stand to tamp, if not, grab some of them (if not auto-tamping).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Refrigeration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't recommend using a cooler with ice for dairy - it's going to start off as too cold and work its way up to being too warm. A small dorm-size fridge would be better, and cheap enough that you can have a backup you can run home to get if you need it. Get a good fridge thermometer to figure out the ideal setting for the fridge (usually a dial between 0 and 9), mark it with a sharpie once you get around 35 degrees Fahrenheit (don't buy one that won't go below 40 degrees). Remember that fridges have cold spots, so measure at the bottom as well as near the coils (where the ice lives).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also need refrigeration for you, too. Nothing says gross like sweat falling into coffee! An evaporative air cooler, or at least some fans really help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Misc Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your pour-over setup, some presses, tables, rubber mats, pitchers, various kinds of spoons, condiment / syrup dispensers, napkins, etc. Don't forget cups, sleeves, alternative sweeteners (be nice, buy honey from a vendor there, helps business). Also, don't forget corrugated trays (recycled) for large orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also never have enough cotton bar mop rags. Don't forget a camping stove or induction cooker, and if you use an induction cooker, make sure everything you need to put on it will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going to be blending stuff, get a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; blender that can eat through ice easily. Another thing that's nice to have two of in case one breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't forget, you need to be able to wash your hands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Sanitizer is good, but having a basin and bucket is also helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, don't forget whack-buckets, trash cans, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ticket Handling System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really important. Imagine you have 20 people lined up and 10 orders going. Make sure you know what people ordered, what needs to go out next, and that the tickets are clear. Soy instead of whole milk? Make sure the person making the drink knows that, and that it goes to the right person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POS (point of sale) systems are increasingly cheap and really help with this. But old fashioned pen and paper tickets work well too, if you have a system in place. This is a really bad way a great setup can fail if you don't get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Water&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're going to need some big plastic bladders full of clean filtered water. You'll also need to make sure it's possible to get that water into the coffee machines easily :) Transporting that much water can be a challenge because it can get so heavy that applying the breaks in a normal vehicle takes on a whole new dynamic. Got a place that delivers it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you do a dry run, that's the only way you'll be sure you have everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything else is pretty unique to what you want to offer, but if you keep it simple it's not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; bad. If you're going to offer cakes and snacks, have a way to keep them fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Menu Items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep it simple and keep it confined to what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can make consistently well. Tell people they're welcome to ask, but avoid anything super complicated from becoming a permanent fixture on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cost your drinks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should charge 3x your cost to be safe, 2 - 2.5x if you want or need to be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; competitive. 3x is pretty certain to cover your costs, overhead, and profit. You need to know how much it costs you to make every single thing, how much it costs to just open and tear down, and everything else. Another great reason for keeping a simple (10 things is good) menu.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are coffee flavorings found around the globe?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Recently I learned that in some Middle Eastern countries they add cardamom and cloves to their coffee to flavor it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any other coffee flavorings found around the globe I might not have heard of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I prefer my coffee flavored just with water. However, it is common for people to flavor their coffee with many other ingredients with respect to their personal preference. As personal preference is closely related to culture, &lt;strong&gt;yes, you may enlist some location-based flavoring ingredients for coffee&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Turkey&lt;/strong&gt;, generally, coffee does not have any ingredients except sugar. In the west part, mastic is sometimes added for flavor. This is a common tradition with Greeks, I assume. In the Southeast part, cardamom is rarely added. This is a common tradition with Syrians, I assume. I never heard of cloves around here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugar&lt;/strong&gt; and its close relatives: I think this is the most common one, independent from the geography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Milk&lt;/strong&gt; may be the second most common one. Mostly used in the Italian-influenced Western coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chocolate&lt;/strong&gt; is only common in the Austrian-influenced coffee recipes, I assume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From now on, I think we may say not very common flavorings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/strong&gt; is common both on Austrian-influenced coffees and old-style coffees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastic&lt;/strong&gt; is common around Aegean Sea with Turkish brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardamom&lt;/strong&gt; is common around Syria with Turkish brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloves&lt;/strong&gt; is common around Arabian Peninsula with Saudi brewing method (say, a brewing method close to Turkish).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chicory&lt;/strong&gt; is common in Vietnam, South India and in New Orleans/Southern Louisiana of USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Butter&lt;/strong&gt; is common in East Africa, Himalayas and very recently in North America under the fancy name of "bulletproof".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coconut&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Marjoram&lt;/strong&gt; are my recent encounters in some old Turkish recipes together with Cardamom. Especially, when the beans are ground in &lt;em&gt;dibek&lt;/em&gt;, an ancient Turkish coffee mortar.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to prevent Bonavita 1900 TS drip-brewer from producing bitter flavored coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My family bought me a Bonavita 1900 TS for Father's day. Unfortunately after burning through 3/4 of a bag of coffee, I still haven't produced a good tasting carafe of coffee. Every time, it comes out (varying levels, but still) bitter and dry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried grinding (with my Capresso Infinity) in the exact middle setting and worked my way all the way to the most coarse setting under coarse. Can still go further, but I have a feeling I'm missing something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using BJ's Kona blend Arabica, medium roast. Yeah, not the highest grade stuff. But I like it good enough from my old 12 cup Cuisinart at 6 scoops with 12 cups of water (per the coffeemaker measurement). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried anywhere from 55-65g of grounds with 1L of water in the Bonavita. Which is way more grounds than I used to use in my old Cuisinart, but I'm trying to follow recommendations I've found online.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased the Bonavita as well. After years of using basic automatic drip coffee makers this was an adjustment. I still haven't perfected the art of the cup using the Bonavita. The problem is that the Bonavita brews at the correct temperature, so I think you really need to be a little more precise when brewing (at least that's what I discovered).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the Bonavita brews only 8 cups--and each cup is only 5 oz. I use a scale to get as close as I can to the correct water-coffee ratio. I no longer use a scoop: a scale is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found that with the Bonavita a medium course grind is best. I also found that lighter roasts are less likely to produce the bitter flavor you are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually brew at a water ratio of 1:14. So that means that I use about 84 grams of coffee for a full pot. I know, seems like a lot of coffee. i never used that much with my Mr. Coffee.  But, once you figure out the correct grind and amount, the Bonavita produces a great cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://baristahustle.com/the-coffee-compass/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://baristahustle.com/the-coffee-compass/&lt;/a&gt; and read the article. The &amp;quot;Coffee Compass&amp;quot; really helped me out in trying to get that great cup. Just the other day, I ground up some coffee at a slightly higher setting and the coffee was weak. So now, using that setting, I had to up the amount of coffee by a couple of grams and it was perfect. And that was thanks to the Coffee Compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so trial and error, I have to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the basic ratios to use with the Bonavita. I have found that the 1:14 produces the better cup in my opinion. Also, lighter roasts tend to not be as bitter as the darker roasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonavita cup = 5 oz. (147.87 grams = 1 Bonavita cup or 29.574 grams an
ounce) Each cup = 5.215 ounces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Bonavita Cups = 20 oz = 591.47 g   (Ratios:  1:14=42 g; 1:15=39 g;
1:16=37 g) Note: Finer grind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Bonavita Cups = 25 oz = 739.33 g (Ratios:  1:14=53 g; 1:15=49 g; 1:16=46 g)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 Bonavita Cups = 30 oz = 887.20 g   (Ratios:  1:14=63 g; 1:15=59 g; 1:16=55.45 g) Note: Medium grind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 Bonavita Cups = 40 oz =1182.94 g  (Ratios:  1:14=84.5 g; 1:15=79 g; 1:16=74 g) Note: Courser grind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps. Happy brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Roasting suggestion for Behmor 1600+ for Rwandan beans</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My Behmor manual suggests profiles 1 and 2 for hard beans, 3 and 4 for soft low grown beans, and 5 for Island beans, city/city+. I've been roasting Rwandan beans on 3 and it's the best, but a little flat, and bread like. Profile 4 seems to over roast (tobacco like) and profile 5 is very over roasted (flat, bitter, grainy and unpleasant). Profiles 1-2 seem to scorch the heck out of anything and the roast time is super fast and the result charred tasting coffee. I am following the guide and am roasting for a minute and thirty seconds after the first crack. I have not attempted to manually control the temperature. For a Rift Valley bean which default profile seems to work the best, and should I generally try to go longer or shorter after the first crack?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I should mention I am cooling the beans rapidly by opening the door when I end the roast and force air into the roaster with an electric leaf blower. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit #2: I am waiting 24hrs before cupping. More or less trying to follow scaa guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit #3
Attached is a plot of how I have been roasting. I know it says "BT" in the legend, but this is actually environment. The thermocouple was very close to middle/bottom of the drum, but not quite touching. I have not attempted to increase the drum speed at or during FC yet. This is my baseline. I will attempt to increase the drum speed next time. &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D95h9.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D95h9.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Your times are right where they should be.
Can you control the airflow and/or temps while you are roasting in a Behmor? If so, try to increase the airflow near or after the first crack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has quite a lot of space for coffee and not so much for water (I am filling them up both to max).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it intended for coffee to be re-brewed (water changed) or I should change beans every time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The photo you have posted is a standard moka pot (See Wikipedia entry &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) by a well-known brand, actually the inventor of the moka pot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should fill it up to the safety line.&lt;/strong&gt; You should see it when you fill it. That line is generally curved inside. Filling it more than this line may cause high pressure due to evaporation of water and it may cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This equipment is not intended to re-brew coffee, but to brew coffee that tastes similar to espresso on the stove. (8 grams of coffee per 30 ml of water is the common accepted ratio.)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is a good packaging when importing green beans to a temperate climate?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Importing green beans matters to bring great quality to the cup. But the beans travel from their native mountains in the Green Belt to various climates. What packaging is best when transporting to a temperate climate ("real seasons", a bit of everything, from sun to rain to snow, and negative to positive temperatures).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packaging could be with traditional hemp bags, with plastic bags, with bacteria-protecting bags, etc. I heard some stories of hemp-packed beans contaminated by animals when transporting by boat. In the past, I have imported hundreds kilos by plane in regulated atmosphere, for best quality, but it may be overdoing it (the beans where quite expensive). All in all, I guess it depends on the kind of beans and transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Anything that is air tight would be best. Grain pro, ziplock, etc..
Vacuum packing is optimal.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I make french press coffee taste less acidic?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is there a trick to making coffee, particularly french press, taste less acidic? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Without any more specific information about the coffee you use and what recipe you use for the french press, we won't be able to give you a specific answer with a solution to your problem. However too acidic probably means that your coffee is underextracted. That means the water hasn't had enough time or wasn't hot enough to extract the flavor compounds you want out of the ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few variables that will influence extraction with french press. I already mentioned time and heat. A recipe that I have used with very good results is 6g coffee per 100ml of water, ground to the size of coarse salt with a steep time of 4min. At first you only add a little water (just off the boil), twice to three times the weight of coffee grounds and let sit for 1min. Then give it a stir (there will be grounds on the top forming a crust), add the rest of the water and wait until 4min. Plunge and immediately transfer your coffee to a preheated vessel, either your mugs or a jug. Important here is that you don't let the coffee sit as it will continue to extract and taste bitter after a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should give you an even, full bodied extraction. If you feel like it's still too acidic, you could vary the variables involved. If you grind slightly finer the extraction will be higher. Same thing if you increase the brew time a bit. I suggest you just play around and keep in mind that these variables are not independent of each other. Finer grind means faster extraction for example. With a basic understanding of how extraction works you should get the hang of it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the coffee still tastes too acidic although you have tried all suggestions check if the roast is too light, since light roasts tend to have more acidity. Also the origin of your coffee is a factor, african coffees (there are many different regions and processing methods so this is a big generalization) tend to be more acidic, while sumatran coffees are considered the least acidic. Central and South American coffees will often have acidity levels in the middle range.
It might also be sour because the coffee is stale (around 4 weeks after roasting for whole beans, much much much faster for preground) or it might just be shitty coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good little intro in the world of extraction (or rather which tastes are associated with different levels of extraction):
&lt;a href="https://baristahustle.com/blog/coffee-extraction-and-how-to-taste-it/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Coffee Extraction and How to Taste It&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Descaling Nespresso with citric acid</title>

However lactic acid can be hard to get by and Nespressos own solution is heart-stoppingly expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;My opinion is that you can use citric acid. That's all that I use and I use it with my espresso machines, drip coffer maker, and I have used with Nespresso and Keurig machines. It is food safe. I buy it at my local beer and wine supply store. I have read to to use 12 - 18 grams of citric acid to a liter of water. I believe many descale solutions are made from citric acid. I use 3 1/2 teaspoons of citric acid to 40 oz of water to make my descaling solution. You can follow the manufacturers suggested routine of descaling. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does instant coffee need more milk/sugar to get desired taste?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;This morning I brewed some coffee at work using a &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/pour-over" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pour-over&lt;/a&gt; and noticed that the amount of milk and sugar required to get the desired taste and whiteness was significantly less. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not mean because it tastes better it needs less, &lt;em&gt;the amount of milk and sugar needed was less&lt;/em&gt;. Is this due to the density of instant coffee which requires it to have more for the taste to be recognizable? Or is there more to it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This question is fairly ambiguous as you've simply described the result as a 'desired taste' so I cannot tackle the question from a specific angle. However, the differences you describe may be a symptom of the fact that there are big differences between instant coffee and your pour-over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actual coffee.&lt;/strong&gt; Your pour-over must be done with coffee grounds and so you are producing a cup of coffee freshly extracted from the grounds and subsequently freshly enjoyed. Not to mention the beans used might simply be of a higher quality than that used in instant coffee manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pour-over.&lt;/strong&gt; The brewing method itself is often known to produce much more nuanced flavours as it allows the brewer control of water flow as opposed to automated brewers. This means that you can better extract the sugars and compounds that give coffee its aroma and flavour. Instant coffee is not fresh and the general manufacturing process is done en masse so the level of control that you would have to fine tune your cup of pour-over coffee will simply not be present in instant coffee. Also, due to the extra processes involved in freeze-drying and packaging the instant coffee, many flavourful compounds can be lost well before it reaches your cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The factors noted above can change the resulting cup you enjoy and therefore change the amount of milk or sugar you will need in order for you to achieve your desired taste. Since the pour-over method can extract more sugars and delicate compounds that make coffee so delicious, it will also reduce the requirement of extra sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm using a Tescoma paloma moka pot (aluminium) and after three years (and one mistake made by a friend of mine - tried to clean it with detergent) I noticed a build-up of two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that they are not removed after brewing or washing with water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the other similar questions but I'm not able to guess if this is oxidization or something that I should be afraid of. What is your opinion on that?&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You have mentioned that you've seen similar questions but... Did you see this one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2069/what-are-these-spots-on-the-inside-of-my-moka-pot-do-i-need-to-remove-them"&gt;What are these spots on the inside of my moka pot? Do I need to remove them?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If yes, then I can help you with two things. First, rust is not possible as your moka pot is aluminum. Therefore, only aluminum oxide and mold are the two options left. Second, if you can remove it, it's mold. Otherwise, it's oxidation and does no harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to remove mold? Bleach is probably the easiest option of you really rinse well afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does my moka pot sputter?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have an old 6-cup moka pot (bialetti) that I recently replaced the filter and the rubber gasket (bialetti brand), however the extraction time seems a bit long, bubbles to soon(almost immediately) and sputters out- resulting in that bitter over-extracted taste.  Strangely, it did work fine just a few times after I replaced the gasket but soon after the sputtering started. Thinking that maybe the rubber gasket was faulty, I replaced it again, but still the same problem. In the past, this moka pot has produced good brews with a nice uniform flow.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could it be something is off with the safety valve i.e. not sealing enough and allowing pressure to escape? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I also have a 3-cup moka pot one that I have tested with the same process (pre-heating water, grind level, grind amount, medium heat) and the results are consistently good.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Folks - please be aware that there are at least two different thicknesses (not talking diameter) for Moka pots. I know that Bialetti makes gaskets in at least 2 different thicknesses.  If your Moka pot design needs a thicker one and the replacement is the thinner one, the seal will never be what it needs to be and the flow of coffee will be affected. Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does room temperature matter when dripping?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When hand dripping coffee in Winter, some water vanishes into mist. We obviously need to go quick before the water temperature drops too much. Also, a cold room tends to cause more mist, making hard to see the coffee ground while dripping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a recommended room temperature for "better" drip? Better here may mean higher quality drink result, or just more convenient ways of dripping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is more about hand-dripping, but it could matter with machines as well.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I would say that room temperature can have an affect on the final outcome of your coffee if the room your in is cold enough. Probably not so much if your sitting in a warm room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say this because to get a full extraction from your coffee, your water should be between &lt;a href="https://bettercoffeeathome.com/make-better-coffee-home/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;90°C - 96°C&lt;/a&gt; and being in a cold environment can cool that water rather quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in calculating the speed at which water cools, here is some "light" reading that goes over newton's law of cooling if you're interested: &lt;a href="http://stanwagon.com/public/evaporationportmannwagonmier.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://stanwagon.com/public/evaporationportmannwagonmier.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure what the ideal room temperature would be though. I would guess one that would allow your water to stay hot enough for the whole brew time. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Pour over coffee is too bland or too acid</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I buy coffee from local roaster and when I make it in two mins, pour over with v60, it gets too acid. If I make it in 2:45 it gets too bland. My other settings are the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 seconds off boil. 17-18 grams coffee per 250ml of water. Washed filter, pre infused for 40 seconds, dripped in spiral form. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear that the roaster is not worth the effort but it's the only local roaster I know. They leave the roasted coffee in a pot for 2 days and they put it in a bag with valve only when you buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should I try to give this coffee a chance?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It sounds like the main thing you're not carefully controlling for is &lt;strong&gt;temperature&lt;/strong&gt;.  I have found that if I use cooler temperatures (80-92 degrees celsius) for my pour-over, I get very bright/acidic tones.  Hotter water (92-100 degrees celsius) always gives me more bitterness and earthy flavors.  I use an electric kettle with a thermometer to maintain the temperature accurately so I can keep a temperature in the middle, in order to get both sets of flavors.  I would guess that by 2:45, your water is too cool and you're just extracting the acidic notes.  Try keeping your water hotter (and measure to see what temperature you're using).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might also suggest giving your coffee a nice 60 second bloom time (pour enough water over them to get them wet, then wait for the gas to escape).  That helps you extract everything (complex and bitter notes included) from the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also consider letting your coffee age a bit longer.  Sometimes, beans are best 7+ days after roasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it possible to make nitro cold brew coffee with a siphon?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering, would it be possible to just purchase cold brew coffee, and pressurize it in a siphon with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O gas? As far as I know, one is supposed to use N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas for nitro cold brew, but I wonder how it would taste with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O instead. Has anyone attempted this before?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I assume that it is possible. However, what will be the benefit? This is my opinion, but... We must try to drink coffee, not generate fancy chemical experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the objective part:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressurizing seems quite easy in room temperature. Depressurizing is quite problematic in a siphon. So, it will be a mess when you try to collect your brewed coffee. Or, requires fancy equipment or conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a siphon, you collect the brewed coffee very rapidly. However, in cold-brew methods, the aim is brewing in a very very long time to extract the floral notes. This, again, seems problematic in your proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main aim of siphon: you make infusion on top for desired amount of seconds, then, rapidly filter the infused coffee to the bottom layer. If you want to make &lt;em&gt;infused&lt;/em&gt; cold brew, the easiest method is still again, going for a french press.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much "coffee" is there in my cup?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Kind of a strange question... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you brew your coffee to your liking, a v60 filter or an espresso. The ingredients are water and coffee grounds. But how much 'coffee' is there actually in the end cup? That is, if you would be able to extract the water from the cup; what percentage of the original cup of coffee would be left?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone ever read anything about this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm trying to get at is; the &lt;em&gt;strength&lt;/em&gt; of a cup of coffee. Everyone uses the saying &lt;em&gt;a strong cup of coffee&lt;/em&gt; when they quite often refer to the roasting. This could also be a reference to how diluted coffee is; e.g. an americano. But what percentage of that americano would then be 'real coffee'. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is discussed in many different contexts many times, I assume. So, I can say not a very strange question in essence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I advise you to check a previous answer first. It includes a very nice chart and the ideal point for quality brewing of coffee. Also, it shows the extraction ratios, a hint of TDS (total dissolved solids) etc. I copy its link just below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/481/whats-the-recommended-coffee-to-water-ratio-for-cold-brew/3440#3440"&gt;What&amp;#39;s the recommended coffee to water ratio for cold brew?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you see, if you can manage to brew an ideal coffee, you can extract only around 20% of the valuable "essence" from the core of the beans. That's the reason why some of the members of &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Coffee SE&lt;/a&gt; tries to re-brew the used grounds for a second time (I assume), as you can follow below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1749/brewing-with-the-coffee-grounds-twice"&gt;Brewing with the coffee grounds twice?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, some other members discuss the TDS part to find the golden brewing point at the first chart. The easiest way to follow that point repeatedly is done by a refractometer. It is a device that can measure opaqueness. So, by measuring the opaqueness of your brew, you may reason on the amount of dissolved coffee "essence" in the water; therefore you may estimate the strength of your cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  <title>Aluminium v's Ceramic storage</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been reading a wikipedia article about the best material for a coffee jar for storing beans, which recommends ceramic or dark glass. I then came here and there is a recent question about aluminium packaging for preserving beans. This makes me a little confused, because I thought that aluminium, i.e metal, would affect negatively the taste of the beans. Then I read that ceramic can contain a large amount of lead, which makes me even more concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were thinking about the perfect storage for your beans, what would be your material of choice? Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Typically aluminum packaging is actually a three (or more) layered packaging with aluminum not being in direct contact with the beans.  Aluminum is a superb barrier to air, and it is typically used as an internal layer to prevent air transferring into the bag, without being in direct contact with the beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keys to optimal packaging:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prevent light from reaching beans.  Light will help to speed oxidation of coffee oils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prevent air from reaching beans but don't restrict air from escaping beans!  This is where the 1 way degassing valve comes in.  Coffee will offgas carbon dioxide if it is fresh.  High CO2 levels contribute to oxidation, so you want the ability for that gas to escape without constantly recirculating air in your container (which would also contribute to oxidation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think ceramic or dark glass would both be excellent storage solutions provided they have a way to degas the coffee.  These materials (provided they have good methods of sealing the container) would prevent air transfer into the coffee, and would sufficiently block light to prevent oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of an aluminum coffee bag I snagged from the internet has a PET internal liner, Aluminum barrier layer, and an LDPE external layer. So.. basically aluminum sandwiched between foodsafe plastic and something that looks good on a shelf =p&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Using just a filter without a pour-over to brew coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine sent me an image of how he brews coffee some times when he doesn't have a pour over to brew filtered coffee: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1jn4U.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1jn4U.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is possible, is there a particular advantage in brewing when using a pour-over together with the filter than with the filter alone?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It is certainly &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to avoid using a cone, and I have also done this in a pinch. Though it works, &lt;strong&gt;there is no real benefit to using a bare filter&lt;/strong&gt; (that is, using a paper filter without a filter-holding cone or other device) as far as the brew/outcome is concerned (other than the obvious, trivial facts of less equipment and not having to clean the cone). There are other &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt; to not use a cone, and there are also a few downsides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main downside is that &lt;strong&gt;paper filters are quite flimsy&lt;/strong&gt;, especially certain brands and types (e.g., Hario V-cones are very thin as compared to thick, almost fabric-like Chemex). They are meant to be used with a supporting cone or basket. With support, they hold together nicely. Without support, they can easily rip, be otherwise damaged, or collapse when filled with water. The consequences are natural: contamination of brewed coffee with grounds, spilled near-boiling water, or other mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might argue that you have better control over the speed or length of infusion, but the coffee will not drain as well or as quickly. You can precisely control the length of water/grounds contact with reasonable pouring methods. The ridges on the cone filter (like &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2013/what-purpose-have-those-grooves-inside-the-dripper"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1658/why-does-the-filtrate-sometimes-well-up-in-the-upper-cone-when-using-the-chemex/"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; question) help to wick the coffee away from the filter so that it drains better. You can also find cones that have a drain plug (&lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00EOM5RN0" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;one example&lt;/a&gt;), so that you can steep the grounds for some time before draining, but I don't believe in that either. No matter what, I argue there's no benefit to a bare filter for this reason either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there are reasonable ways to use a bare filter. I sometimes use &lt;strong&gt;a bare filter for cold-brewing&lt;/strong&gt; coffee without other equipment: I use a large basket-style filter (&lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0006VNO7Y" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;arbitrary example&lt;/a&gt;) with some grounds, then tied up with a piece of kitchen string into a small sachet like a tea bag, then submerged in a jar of water (see other &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/cold-brew" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;cold-brew&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;cold-brew&lt;/a&gt; questions, and &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/431/how-can-i-make-filtering-my-cold-brew-easier"&gt;my problems&lt;/a&gt; with same). However, I still have to be very careful to prevent the filter from tearing when removing it from the brewed coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your friend is clever and plucky for sure; however, I don't think your friend's method is going to catch on at your local coffee shop as the next fancy brew method.&lt;/p&gt;

Actually, back in my drip coffee days, I'd sometimes put a couple sprinkles in with the grounds before brewing to spice it up. Good stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>French press vs instant coffee - health</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;At work I usually drink instant coffee, but I found out that one can buy French press mugs. I did some research about which of these methods of preparing coffee is healthier, it seems that there's no consensus. Assuming that the taste doesn't matter, which method would you recommend? We're talking about one, maximum two cups a day, so no extreme amounts. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As far as I know there are no health concerns about coffee aside from caffeine consumption. Unless there are additives in instant coffee that I'm unaware of then there ought to be no substantive difference between the two (French Press and instant).  Instant coffee is simply coffee which was freeze dried either by spraying droplets in the air or crushed after freezing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the health concerns, if any, would be relative to the amount of caffeine you consume. You mention that you drink two cups a day. That is below every recommended max consumption I've ever seen (4 cups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may build an equation such as: one cup of espresso includes around 7 grams of coffee, 7 grams of coffee could be grounded around 50 mid-sized beans. So, if you eat 50 of these drops, it will be roughly equal to a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Maxwell house instant coffee powder aroma</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My office just got a case of Maxwell House instant coffee. As noted by my co-worker, the aroma of the coffee powder smells more like &lt;em&gt;soy sauce&lt;/em&gt; than coffee, which most of the instant coffees we had. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual coffee tasted fine, the initial aroma was just offsetting. Is there any specific reason (maybe in the method of processing) for why the aroma of Maxwell House instant coffee powder smells this way? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Instant coffee is not generally considered to be the epitome of great tasting, or smelling coffee. It's almost the antithesis of artisanal whole bean arabica coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iconic and appealing smell of freshly roasted or brewing coffee is due to arabica coffee. Instant coffee though is mostly, and often completely, made from lower cost robusta beans. Robusta beans have a distinctly different taste and &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/4032/why-are-robusta-beans-considered-low-brow"&gt;aroma profile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while industrial roasters have gotten very good at coaxing arabica-like flavours from instant coffee, the underlying qualities are still there and still noticed in the aroma. So the short answer is that your brand of instant coffee smells a lot more like typical robusta beans than the more desirable arabica beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aroma is somewhat subjective and can be easily influenced by suggestion. I can understand your perception of soya sauce, although that characterization might be a bit off the mark. Soy sauce covers a large range but is something of an earthy umami aroma usually having malty seasoning, cooked potato, caramel, alcoholic, smoky or honey notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myself I would describe the MH instant coffee aroma as bittersweet like the artificial sweetener, Sweet n low, sweet and bitter/metallic/alcohol aroma over a predominantly peanut and wet paper flavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, we have difficulties finding these cleaning materials around. (Sure we can order abroad, but this time customs, etc. probably will be a mess and it will take too much time and effort.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anybody have an idea what can I replace these with?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can you stir a pour-over?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Can you stir during a pour-over brewing process, or are you really just meant to let it sit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask this because not all pour-over filters are created equal, and some work better than others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factors do include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. filter shape (flat-bottom, conical, combination of the two), b. filter media (steel, paper, cloth), and;
c. grind size of the grounded beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, when it comes to drip speed, you can just adjust with grind size, try to match it to filter type, follow a decent technique in water pouring to agitate the grounds, and you'll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is the purity of this method best left to water and gravity? Or has anyone ever stirred the coffee slush at any point during the brew process to favorable results? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm open to any answer really. I would very much like to hear answers from a practical standpoint (i.e. Will stirring make the coffee brew faster? Taste differently?), as well from a theoretical standpoint that Illustrates the pour-over for what it is meant to be, as a zen-like, artisanal experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do enjoy the process very much, so I'm really just curious if stirring has ever been a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The short answer is yes you can stir pour overs and it can be useful but generally not recommended. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary use for stirring pour overs that I have seen is a very light stir to jostle grounds that have stuck to the brewing methods walls. The slight stir at the maximum volume of water in the filter makes sure that as fluid drains grounds stay in the slurry of water and are evenly extracted.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's the optimal size of a moka pot for a single espresso?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm new to brewing coffee. All I'm after is a single espresso in the morning. Sometimes latte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've recently got myself a 6 cup moka pot - the smallest one we had in a local store. Doing it by instruction gets me a full pot of something in the middle between filter coffee and machine espresso. A bit watery to my taste. I like it stronger. So I use hot water and cut the extraction short - as soon as it starts bubbling - pot gets cooled. Like that I end up with about 1.5-2 cups of espresso with a stronger taste just a tiny bit bitter, just the way I like it. A bit wasteful though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I bought a 1 cup pot, which is much smaller. The extraction process runs smoothly and ends up quicker. The bubbling phase is very short and happens at the very end. It doesn't dilute the result much. I get exactly 1 cup. The taste is just a bit weaker than what I get from the 6 cup one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is strange, the volume is 6 times less, but the end result is only half smaller. I'm looking for a happy medium, probably should go for a 3-4 cup or 2? What would you suggest to pick for a single espresso?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I figured it out. I bought a 2 cup Bialetti Brikka. It's a moka pot with a special valve. The main purpose of the valve is crema formation. It's also a bit easier to use than a regular moka pot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is designed to start with cold water. Just use the exact amount (there is a measure) not more, not less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It streams coffee for only few seconds and you don't have to play with the heat intensity while brewing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The brewing occurs at higher pressure and temperature - thus stronger coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And yes, decent crema!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get exactly one full espresso cup of strong and nice tasting coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Finding if coffee is a health risk after best before</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have couple of coffee in my cabin where I visit on weekend and I saw 2 coffee which were best before xx 2017. One has big chunk of coffee and looks faded and the other got faded colour. I have no idea if it is instant or ground but namely one is Nescafé &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9qJyP.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9qJyP.jpg" alt="Alta Rica"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;and other is &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jOTyB.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jOTyB.jpg" alt="Kenco Millicano"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;With all foods, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/six-factors-for-food-spoilage-996027" rel="noreferrer"&gt;FAT TOM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is your best start to gauge their susceptibility to spoilage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, FAT TOM is actually an acronym for the six factors that influence the growth of microbes. And bacterial growth is what causes food to turn bad in two senses, namely &lt;em&gt;gross&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dangerous&lt;/em&gt;, although the two often go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The factors are:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;ood&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;cidity&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ime&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;emperature&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;xygen&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;oisture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory it's sufficient to eliminate just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; factor to prevent spoilage, but in practical applications, it's often a combination of a few. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for your coffee, the main factors are &lt;em&gt;moisture, food and time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your Nescafé, the granules are dry, have very little "food" for pathogens (proteins are a real problem, for example) and are around or slightly past the best-before date&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. If you say the coffe still tastes fine, I see no reason to suspect it to be unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure about the second product, but will for now assume it's some kind of "cappuchino mix" that includes dry milk or another kind of creamer. My conclusion is largely the same as for the Nescafé product, but with a higher protein ("food") and possibly fat content. So you have a slightly higher risk of "spoilage", but it's not really about food safety, just rancidity and development of "off" flavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to sum it up:
If your instant coffee still tastes fine, dissolves as it should and was stored in reasonable conditions (dry, room temperature, closed container), there are no food safety concerns. You might want to use it within the next few months, though, but mainly due to quality reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Another common misconception: "best before" does not indicate immediate spoilage after that date, it is a time by which the manufacturer assures you the product will be in excellent condition. This means also sensory attributes like taste or consistency. Plus there is always a safety margin included to be on the safe side, even if the consumer stores the product under less-than-ideal conditions.

  <title>Is dark roast stronger than light roast?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Dark roast coffee is roasted longer and at higher temperatures than light roast.
What is the difference in taste?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strength&lt;/em&gt; is an interesting wording, but some people use it. Mostly, caramelized or burnt flavors get visible during the roasting process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3735/understanding-coffee-bean-names-as-they-relate-to-roast/3738#3738"&gt;Understanding Coffee Bean names as they relate to roast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may see in that answer, Wikipedia enlists roast degrees and their profiles. I would like to summarize them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22 °C (72 °F), Green Beans&lt;/strong&gt;: You may prepare green coffee tea from these. But not the regular coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;165 °C (329 °F), Drying Phase&lt;/strong&gt;: Beans dry out. You may hear the first crack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;196 °C (385 °F), Cinnamon Roast&lt;/strong&gt;: A very light roast level which is immediately at first crack. Sweetness is underdeveloped, with prominent toasted grain, grassy flavors, and sharp acidity prominent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;205 °C (401 °F), New England Roast&lt;/strong&gt;: Moderate light brown, but still mottled in appearance. A preferred roast for some specialty roasters, highlights origin characteristics as well as complex acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;210 °C (410 °F), American Roast&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium light brown, developed during first crack. Acidity is slightly muted, but origin character is still preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;219 °C (426 °F), City Roast&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium brown, common for most specialty coffee. Good for tasting origin character, although roast character is noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;225 °C (437 °F), Full City Roast&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium dark brown with occasional oil sheen, roast character is prominent. At the beginning of second crack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;230 °C (446 °F), Vienna Roast&lt;/strong&gt;: Moderate dark brown with light surface oil, more bittersweet, caramel flavor, acidity muted. In the middle of second crack. Any origin characteristics have become eclipsed by roast at this level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;240 °C (464 °F), French Roast&lt;/strong&gt;: Dark brown, shiny with oil, burnt undertones, acidity diminished. At the end of second crack. Roast character is dominant, none of the inherent aroma or flavors of the coffee remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;245 °C (473 °F), Italian Roast&lt;/strong&gt;: Nearly black and shiny, burnt tones become more distinct, acidity nearly eliminated, thin body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  <title>What exactly is the difference between coffee and coffee extract?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;One company lists its product ingredients as, "coffee (filtered water, coffee extract), natural flavor (with natural coffee flavor)." The extract's "97% Arabica by volume" and "starts with coffee beans"? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, why would coffee need "natural coffee flavor?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does "coffee extract's" caffeine content differ from "coffee's"?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could someone break this down for a neophyte? Thanks, &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As clear an answer as likely there is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baristahustle.com/blogs/barista-hustle/coffee-extraction-and-how-to-taste-it" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Extraction is everything that the water takes from the coffee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a cup of coffee is coffee extract. A shot of espresso is coffee extract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as natural coffee flavor, it's just marketing geek talk, maybe trying to distance themselves from products like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is hardest for people to understand how we can use coffee flavor without having any coffee in &lt;strong&gt;the product&lt;/strong&gt;. The components of coffee flavor can be extracted from a number of natural ingredients that include coffee, chicory and even, believe it not, garlic! It’s hard to imagine that coffee and garlic share the same flavor component, but they do. The expertise of flavor chemists allows them to derive flavors by isolating them from other compounds that don’t contribute to flavor.
  Thus it is possible to produce coffee flavor without caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe your coffee product is emphasizing that it is made from actual coffee. It's like saying "meat (with natural meat flavor)&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Why did espresso never catch on as a mainstream drink in the US?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I live in the US. During a recent trip to France, I was struck by the fact that espresso is the default coffee configuration there (i.e., if you order "coffee" in a restaurant without specifying further, espresso is what you get). And Nespresso-compatible coffee pods are sold in the supermarket for use in Nespresso-compatible machines, whereas in the US Nespresso hasn't licensed their system to any third parties, so it's still a specialty item. Presumably the same situation prevails in Italy, where espresso originally comes from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, meanwhile, you can get "espresso drinks," but that usually means espresso diluted in a large quantity of milk and syrup. Espresso per se is an esoteric beverage consumed mostly by a small number of enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of what motivates this question is that in some ways espresso seems tailor-made for the American market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invented out of a desire for fast service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Involves large, complex machinery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lends itself to quick consumption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet here we are. So the question is: &lt;strong&gt;are there specific factors, beyond "different countries do things differently," that kept espresso from catching on in the US?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coffee spread throughout Europe in the 17th and 18th C and was brought over to the United States by colonialists and immigrants. Coffee was already a fixture here by the time espresso was invented in the early 20th C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coffee arrived in Italy in the 17th century.It was made in the Turkish manner andconsumed in elite coffee houses such as Florian in Venice.Cappuccino was madeby adding the froth from warm milk to the coffee.However it was only in 1905that the first espresso machine entered into production.
  &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/379110/The_Cappuccino_Conquests._The_Transnational_History_of_Italian_Coffee_2007_" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.academia.edu/379110/The_Cappuccino_Conquests._The_Transnational_History_of_Italian_Coffee_2007_&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espresso did not become a staple of Italian or European culture until after WWII. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By the late 1950s, most Italians consumed coffee at home, in the traditional moka pot—first built by engineer Alfonso Bialetti in 1933, and now an icon of Italian design worldwide, as Morris explains in his 2008 essay “A History of Espresso in Italy and the World.” But there were exceptions. A young Calvino was a regular customer at Caffè Talmone, a café in Turin where he met with other intellectuals to discuss books and politics. There, he drank Italian espresso with a layer of foam on top, the result of a patent registered by bar owner Achille Gaggia in 1947.
  &lt;a href="https://qz.com/992879/the-curious-tale-of-how-italy-became-the-world-capital-of-coffee/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://qz.com/992879/the-curious-tale-of-how-italy-became-the-world-capital-of-coffee/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did espresso come to dominate European culture after WWII and not the US? Why would any fad or variety necessarily come to dominate the world? Why would a new variety necessarily overcome tradition?  For one thing - espressos require specialty machines that were extremely expensive. Until recently it was not something that would be found in an ordinary kitchen whether in Italy or the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I tell them apart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm talking about distinguishing prepared beverages, not &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2899"&gt;jars of coffee bean grounds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chemical tests with grocery store ingredients welcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this case I was using instant coffee, but I'd prefer a test that applied to any preparation method, after the coffee is already in the cup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/30867/are-there-visual-differences-between-regular-and-decaf-coffee"&gt;similar question&lt;/a&gt; was asked on the cooking stack exchange quite a few years back. The answers and comments there mostly address your first and third points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that there's consensus that bubble formation differs between instant and brewed. However, I assume from your comment that both your decaf and regular were instant. There may still be differences in the bubbles. From Wayfaring Stranger on the Cooking SE: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coffee foam/bubbles is made up of a mixture of proteins, sugars, oil droplets, caffeine etc, and the lifetime of a bubble is highly dependent on the composition of its membrane. Given that decaf is coffee that's been solvent extracted, it wouldn't be at all surprising to see its different composition affecting bubble lifetime. However, no one seems to have conducted definitive studies of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;keywords=caffeine%20test%20strips&amp;amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;amp;index=aps&amp;amp;hvadid=174236525725&amp;amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=10383591526839837152&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=e&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9019794&amp;amp;hvtargid=kwd-11625439237&amp;amp;ref=pd_sl_482klzwo9y_e" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;caffeine testing strips&lt;/a&gt; that might be worth investing in if you're routinely serving coffee to someone who's sensitive to caffeine, but I wouldn't know how feasible it'd be to craft your own alternative with some at-home chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Kirkland coffee beans are charged?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Recently I noticed something interesting about Kirkland's coffee bean. After I ground the bean and dump on the paper filter, some fragments actually stuck to the wall of the filter - as if they were attracted/pulled by the wall and partially overcome the gravitational pull, instead of simply staying at the bottom.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed this couple of month ago, over time, I observed and can confirm that: this did not happen with other brands of beans - so I do not think that this is caused by the paper filter or the grinder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure whether the ground bean is necessarily electronically charged, but that certainly can be a potential explanation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know what caused this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Hi not likely to be a trait of kirkland beans or of packaging of the beans.
Static electricity can build up between the grinder and the beans. - you'll note that the beans will also stick to the sides of whatever receptical they get ground into. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Hack-to-Remove-Static-in-the-Coffee-Grinder/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;one hack to fix this at the grinder stage&lt;/a&gt; 
it used tiny amounts of moisture that likely reduce what's happening in the grinder that casuses static electricity: two materials rubbing against each other - and yes getting charged and repelling from each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now maybe not all beans have this effect to teh same level based on moisture content - dunno - or perhaps its just humidity levels and grind sizes. But assuming for you it is just kirkland beans, and all other settings remain the same, you may want to try this hack and see if that sorts the issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be keen to hear how your test goes.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Apparently they used some sort of a pour over method, I'm not very sure about it though because they wouldn't expose their trade secrets to me ;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am sure is it is common practice for the Vietnamese to sell from concentrate, because they brew a batch in one go then refrigerate it until it is used, not unlike cold brews. If you're a fan of espresso, you can drink the concentrate straight up.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to brew coffee without "film" on top</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Often when brewing coffee I end up with an oily film that rises to the top of the cup. How do I reduce or brew coffee without it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current set up is using a french press and &lt;a href="http://www.lavazza.com/en/at-home/coffee-blends/qualita-rossa.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lavazza Rossa coffee&lt;/a&gt; (I know a fine grind isn't recommended for french press, however being an amateur with a french press I simply bought the brand with a french press on label).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M3sOW.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M3sOW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Regarding the pre-ground coffee in a French Press, the website, packaging and company all say its suitable for a French Press / Plunger.  Technically it is, the big thing is usually the finer grounds being sifted through the filter and into your cup of coffee.  Most people don't like this, I personally don't mind this, though I do prefer not to have grounds in my coffee.  If you were to grind your own coffee, you may still get some finer particles pushing through, but not as much  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I too use a French Press and I noticed some odd things similar to the oily film when I first started.  I changed a TON of what I was doing, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly what caused that to stop.  Here is a few things.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The grounds of the coffee could be part of that film.  As they sift through, some of the finest particles could be coalescing together and forming what looks like an oily film.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Try different grounds (just for a day, change it up)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The appearance of that film could also be due to the sheen of the bean from processing.  Many flavored coffees, even a subtle flavor or a "non-flavor" from a large company, are from the beans being in a flavor oil.  This being Lavazza, I see that it tastes like Pralines, which could be some of the flavor of the oil the company uses to mask any bitterness or roasting flavors.  Not all companies do this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Possibly email company and see if they do add any oil to the coffee (even if its natural or during the roasting process)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the cleanliness of the french press and coffee cup.  I wasn't washing mine thoroughly enough at the beginning and some of that was a residue from soap I am sure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Try to fill the french press or coffee cup with water after washing, let sit and see if it produced film&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dish Washer and detergent.  I had an apartment that had a dish washer and when it started to "go", it would still "clean" things but we would notice that everything had a film on it that was pretty much invisible.  We could tell because we would pour a glass of water, then see the film a couple minutes later.  Sometimes it was obvious.  It could also be the detergent in the dish washer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Try to hand-wash your coffee cup and french press and see if that makes a difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the water.  You may not have control over the water or the quality of the water, but that can play a factor in that oily film.  If the water is not purified or already has a residue, then your coffee will be the same.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pour a glass of water from the same source and let it sit for 15 minutes and see if you get a film.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bag, packaging and storage.  I have a coffee vault for one of coffee's, and when I ran out and reordered more I put a different bean in there.  The previous bean was flavored and some of the oil from the flavor rubbed off on the sides, which then transferred to the new unflavored beans and caused some oily film.  So again, make sure its washed well.  But also, I noticed some bags or packaging have a metallic looking liner inside the bag, and that I feel is often oily.  I am not sure from what or why, could be a preservative coating or just some oil so there isn't bean on metal contact.  That may also transfer to the bean as well.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Check the inside of the bag and see if that has any oil residue inside.  Also email company see if they coat the inside of their packaging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, I forgot, but this goes with washing your french press, wash it as soon as you are done.  Out of forgetfulness or laziness I have left my old brew in there overnight a few times, and I have noticed that the next one may have some residue from the previous still, which may be some of that oily film.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Try washing right away after done with coffee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck, hope this helps and try to keep changing things and see what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How long do the effects of caffeine take to appear?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Taking as a parameter the first sip of coffee we drink, and taking 10 minutes to drink a cup of coffee, how soon are the effects of caffeine to appear?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are a lot of studies out there - but ultimately it's personal.  It's like asking, how long after drinking a glass of wine do you start to feel the affects? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Averages can be arrived at but ultimately everyone is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, it may be psychological, but I start to feel the affects seconds after my first sip. (Assuming it's high octane coffee and not the lukewarm water found in some diners.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen several articles say that coffee takes ten minutes to kick in. Others say 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how they're measuring things but speaking for myself, and numerous others, the psychological affects kick in much sooner. I don't think coffee would be as popular as it is if it took 10-45 minutes to kick in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It takes around 45 – 60 minutes for caffeine to kick in after it is consumed.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scienceabc.com article continues with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons coffee remains so popular is that the effects of caffeine can often be felt for 4-6 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4-6 hours? Ha. Maybe in a controlled environment, where one can measure things to the last drop. In the work environment coffee addicts need to a boost in far less time than that.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much caffeine is in 1 teaspoon of ground Arabica coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Arabica is said to have less caffeine than Robusta. Couldn't find info about this specific  question in Google hence asking here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grind I have is for filter coffee. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.coffeechemistry.com/chemistry/alkaloids/caffeine-in-coffee" rel="noreferrer"&gt;caffeine content&lt;/a&gt; of Arabica beans is around 1,2% of its mass. A standard measure of a teaspoon is approximately 5ml. That means you get around 5g of ground coffee in one teaspoon, which totals around 0,06g or 60mg of caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However please consider that teaspoons and spoons are in general a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaspoon#Metric_teaspoon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;terrible unit of measurement&lt;/a&gt; for various reasons. Normal teaspoons are not standardized. American measuring spoons are close to 5ml but not 5ml. And in general they measure volume and not mass, which makes it dependent on the density of whatever you are measuring. For ground coffee this can vary widely and depends on the bean origin, the roast level, grind size and probably other factors I'm forgetting right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>I'm perplexed on coffee types. What is filter ground coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I bought a new coffee maker and it has a permanent filter and says to only use filter ground coffee.What exactly is filter ground coffee? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Filter ground coffee stands for &lt;strong&gt;roasted, then cracked to smaller pieces to be brewed easily coffee beans&lt;/strong&gt;. The question is, how small and consistent you should crack them to pieces. This is important as it affects the extraction of the coffee, so your cup. You should crack all the coffee beans at the same desired size for a good cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a previous discussion on a similar topic, but on espresso machines: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, what about the right size? It should be about 400 microns for a drip machine that uses filter size grounds. But, don't worry. Coffee shops know about these. All you need to do is just ask for it or read the labels. Here is a quick chart for all coffee brewing methods and ground sizes:&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Completely reusable, stainless-steel, zero-waste Nespresso pods any good?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Getting ready to buy an inexpensive espresso setup for at work. I've been very happy with the EC155, but I've noticed that Nespresso machines are very well engineered, very inexpensive, and much smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not use anything that has throwaway parts, and compostability claims are bogus, but I did find these (actually) zero-waste refillable pods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have experience or educated hypotheses about how well these would work?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:
Depends if the coffee style matches the pod design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How a Nespresso machine works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pod put in the machine gets pierced on the upper side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hot water is released into the pod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pressure rises inside the pod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;due to high pressure a membrane burst at the bottom of the pod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brewed coffee is released&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By modifying the membrane to burst at a higher or lower pressure, other flavors will be extracted from the coffee, like pour over and espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What produces more crema?</title>

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What produces more crema when extracting espresso, darker or lighter roast?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What produces more crema when extracting espresso, finer or coarser coffee grind ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;why am I getting a very thin layer of crema when pulling a SINGLE shot, although the extraction time is 20 sec, the pressure is correct as per the manufacturer of the espresso machine (Breville Barista) I have, and the coffee beans were roasted two weeks ago?! what is wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stuck within coffee grounds produce the crema.&lt;/strong&gt; At least, it is the main substance that forms the crema along with other minor components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very classic problem -and thus a question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you consider roasting, darker roasts have more crema as they contain more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the product of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Maillard reaction&lt;/a&gt;. Here is a &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2172/quantifying-flavor-differences-between-varieties/2550#2550"&gt;proposed previous post to be read&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grind has some effect, but limited.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you have mentioned, time has a crucial importance. I think this should be your main consideration and you should focus on fixing this first. Basically, &lt;strong&gt;fresh coffee has more crema, always&lt;/strong&gt;.

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With coffee moka, you have to fill the funnel with barley only for one half;   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise, you can use the barley model, named as &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004AE1Y0C" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Orzo Express&lt;/a&gt;, they have the funnel shorter and you can fill entirely without problems.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a moka for coffee, and a different one for barley coffee, is a good practice, otherwise the taste of (ground) coffee will be highly altered.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Pouring espresso into hot water versus hot water into espresso</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;struggling to find an answer to this (if there is one), perhaps because nature of the question doesn't work so well with search engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, I've noticed (and so have others I've spoken to about this), that if I make espresso in a moka and want an Americano style coffee (i.e. hot water mixed with espresso -- please don't crucify me if this isn't the correct definition of Americano) then it affects the taste significantly if I make it in these two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boil water in kettle, pour water into mug, pour moka espresso into hot water in mug -- the two mix -- then drink.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;v&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boil water in kettle, pour moka espresso into mug, add hot water into espresso in mug -- the two mix -- then drink.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've noticed the first method produces a nice, smooth Americano that's nice to drink... whereas the second method (coffee in first, add water) produces a relatively less pleasant, sometimes unpleasant, bitter (perhaps?) and very inferior drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is this possible? My only guess is perhaps it's a chemistry thing to do with some kind of oil in the coffee? Or it just mixes better the other way? I have no idea but I swear this difference is real and so do some of my friends, but none of us know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks...&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I would suspect that a few centigrades make all the difference here. With coffee, too high temperatures will negatively affect your flavor. Rule of thumb: Hot is good, boiling isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you put the water in your mug first, you’ll lose just a bit of temperature as the water warms the mug and/or stands for a bit until you add the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reverse the order, you are effectively scalding (some of) the coffee with the boiling water, losing volatile aromatic compounds and degrading others.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Found around 10kg of 18 year old vacuum sealed coffee beans. Safe to consume?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Was cleaning in my office and found around 10kg vacuum sealed &lt;strong&gt;roasted&lt;/strong&gt; coffee beans in the store room. Probably packed around 18 years ago. Dad had a cafe business with some friends around that time and I guess was kept until today. They are packed per 500g in a metallic-ish bag and vacuum sealed. Heard the hiss sound when I opened one. Though I did find some very fine lint type things inside. If you ask me it looks like the ends of a dandelion. Brand is UCC from Japan. Baked some at 180C for 4mins. Made a cup, doesnt have any wierd taste. Should I keep drinking it? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;18 years might be pushing it, and that is impressive!&lt;br&gt;
As a side thing, I would honestly &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; to try some.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not saying that it will definitely be bad, or definitely be good before a certain amount of time, and that is subjective as well..."good" and "bad" being if they still have flavor or taste rancid.  The question is about "safe to consume", with the side topic of being "good flavor".    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, Coffee has a shelf-life about 3-9 months, depending on if its ground, whole, flavored, and how and where its stored.&lt;br&gt;
That may spark some arguments though, but the question is about "safe to consume" not flavor.&lt;br&gt;
At a store, they would not have a bag of coffee on the shelf for more than 1 month from roasting, regardless of how its sealed.&lt;br&gt;
Looking at food vacuum seal places, they say that coffee sealed will last up to 3 years vacuum sealed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://handykitchenaid.com/food-expiration-vacuum-sealed-food-shelf-life-chart/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Link 1 to vacuum bag shelf-life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://foodvacbags.com/pages/storage-time-for-foodvacbags-vacuum-sealed-foods" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Link 2 to vacuum bag shelf-life&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="https://www.eatbydate.com/drinks/coffee-tea-shelf-life/coffee-shelf-life-expiration-date/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; specifically about coffee and has a chart and table for that.
This is right in line with the other articles and what I mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are all recommendations, and there is good reason.  Usually with any vacuum seal there is some oxygen that gets into the product and that will cause it to degrade over time.  The oxygen is part of the air, which may also contain some moisture.  The moisture will also degrade the product over time, creating an environment for bacteria to grow in.  Bacteria needs oxygen and moisture to grow, and the reduced oxygen slows down the process of spoilage and creates an environment to limit the growth, while also limiting the evaporation of any moisture in the food (thus it retaining its flavor).&lt;br&gt;
Also, the vacuum seal can and will degrade over time itself eventually letting in some oxygen and moisture.  This is different depending on the packaging and type of seal.  This is based on the manufacturer of the vacuum seal as well, though some are better than other, often the manufacturer will put a date/time on the seal knowing it will last longer than that but that is the less than minimum, so that way its not an issue when the seal does give.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, when coffee goes bad there could be some mold &lt;strong&gt;IF&lt;/strong&gt; its exposed to moisture for a long period of time, but usually it would just lose its flavor and possibly some of the caffeine.  You can tell if its gone bad by the smell when you open it.  If when you opened it, and it smells of mildew or mold, then its definable bad, and that would be bad to drink.  If its just odorless and bland smell, then it is probably still good to drink, but probably won't have any flavor.  Coffee like that, will not be harmful to you, just not be "good" to taste (but also probably not "bad to taste either).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Though I did find some very fine lint type things inside. If you ask me it looks like the ends of a dandelion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That could have been some of the beans breaking down, or just a bean that got crunched in the packaging a while ago.  Depends on the coloration and smell and such.  Personally, I would try that at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already brewed it and didn't find any bad taste, smell or feeling from drinking it, then its probably good.  Additionally, you could also blend this coffee with other fresh coffee, assuming its still "good" based on the above.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Found &lt;a href="https://www.coffeebrewguides.com/does-coffee-go-bad/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article and this gives more details on it going "bad".&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does coffee really need to be stored in an air-tight container?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am getting conflicting information online about whether or not coffee needs to be stored in an air-tight container. There seem to be two camps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Container must be air-tight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Container must have CO2 vent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even coffee canister manufacturers seem to be at odds with one another. Take the following two products for example, both of which I own. The first is air-tight with a strong vacuum seal whereas the second has an opening in the lid that takes the same type of CO2 filter you see in commercial coffee bags (in fact, I will tear them out of the bags and use them with this canister as they're usually the same type as the ones that initially ship along with it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the final answer as to the proper way to store coffee, specifically whole beans in this case? What are the implications of CO2 build-up in the canister if you open the canister several times per day? Is the CO2 filter on a home coffee canister just a gimmick that only serves a purpose on coffee bags that sit on a shelf sealed for days or weeks on end?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5PLnH.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5PLnH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;How to store coffee beans is a much opiniated area. Degassing CO2 from coffee beans is most important right after the coffee has been roasted, since it would release a lot there and then gradually release less and less over days and weeks.
If then beans can't release the CO2, then there will be a buildup and since CO2 tastes sour, then it will affect the coffees taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee should in general not be stored for too long after it's been roasted, since that will also negatively affect the taste. Storing it dark, dry and airtight will potentially keep it fresh a bit longer, but the best is in my opinion 1 week after roast and before 4 weeks after roast.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>French press temperatures</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;For a few years I have been using a French press. I have a kettle that I can set the temperature. I set it 201 F. I grind my beans fresh. I bloom for 30 seconds and brew for four minutes. I’ve been happy with the coffee and it taste pretty good.
But I took some temperature measurements and I was surprised with the results. After I poured in all the water the temperature had dropped to 184 F and at the end of four minutes the temperature was 162 F. I up the temperature of the kettle to 210 F. This was a little better the temperature dropped to 195 F and at the end the temperature was 172 F. Also I preheat the French press with hot tap water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do people do for temperature in French press?
The coffee taste good but the coffee is not brewing at the ideal temperatures of 195F to 205F. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I brew French Press every morning. I think you are doing everything correct. I brew at a target temperature of 190 degrees. Here's what I do... I bring water to a boil and then pour into the press to preheat the press. I grind my beans and I prefer dark roast. Then I dump out the water in the press and add the ground coffee. I use ratio of 16:1 (16 grams of water for each 1 gram of coffee, so as an example in my 2 cup press I grind 17 grams of beans and pour 272 grams of water. I usually pour 1/2 the water and then stir to bloom using a wooden chopstick (no metal to avoid breaking glass press). Then add balance of water. Cover the press with the screen and then wrap the press using a dish towel to insulate and keep temp up. 4 mins to brew and you have a great cup of Joe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: My opinion is not to get too crazy with what if my temp is off by a degree or so or if I have a gram of coffee or water more or less than target. If you brew it and it tastes good to you that's what counts. If you taste and it seems too strong for your taste just add a bit more hot water to your cup. I never come out with a too weak brew. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Your basket has a size that suits a certain amount of coffee. This can range anywhere between 8-10g to 22g. Check if there are any indicators of this. Failing that, overfill the basket and then sweep your finger across the excess over the top and see how much coffee that is, that's a ballpark figure for how much the basket can comfortably take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You didn't mention if your machine uses a pressurised portafilter (the handle) or not. You can usually tell as it has a single hole at the bottom and is a little deeper than a standard portafilter. These tend to be more forgiving to mistakes in dosing and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn to tamp your coffee evenly and consistently. There are plenty of videos online on how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to figure out a recipe that works, using the weight of the coffee you put in, how much coffee comes out, and how long it takes for that coffee to come out. The standard recipe that is currently in trend is 18g in, 36g out (we use grams instead of ml for simplicity) in about 28 seconds. This is presuming a basket size of 18g though.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Accidentially put aluminum moka pot on stove without water ... is it still usable?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was a bit tired this morning and accidentally put my moka pot (Bialetti Brikka, aluminum) on the stove with the water still in the top (for measuring the amount), instead of pouring it into the boiler. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realized my mistake early enough, no burnt coffee or rubber, no smell. The moka didn't warp or anything. I let it cool down, re-filled it, works as expected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm a bit paranoid (especially regarding the health concerns with aluminum), so I wonder if there's any concern ? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You should be totally fine - and &lt;a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/31514995#31514995"&gt;you aren’t the first person who did something like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aluminum melts at a whopping 660C (933K) and while pure aluminum is chemically very reactive, the pot with its oxide layer is quite stable, so whatever you did will have left your Moka way below any temperature range where anything unwelcome may happen. Especially as you report that the rubber gasket is unharmed, and that would be the first part to suffer any heat damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, Lately my coffee seems to have a film on the top. The picture makes it look a lot worse then it is. It is more translucent in the cup. This happens once the coffee gets cold. When its hot it looks like bubbles or just the oil from the coffee beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is this? Is this just the oil from the coffee? Or do I need to clean my machine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee Details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black Coffee, nothing added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made in espresso machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground to order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run through several times as I "overpacked" the coffee. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hot water added to make Americano. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beans from local roaster, last week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what my coffee looks like before it turns into that:

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It is just oil from the coffee beans. Nothing to be afraid of unless your coffee tastes off. You can stir the coffee to try and reincorporate the oil or use spoons to skim off the oil from the top&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there a way to prevent acid reflux and gastritis while benefiting from cafeine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've read that Caffeine has some properties that relax the stomach sphincter and may lead to acid reflux which causes heartburn and other stomach problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to enjoy coffee and other caffeinated beverages without removing caffeine but still be safe from heartburns and acid reflux?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;One way which has worked for me -- but this of course depends on the severity of your condition -- is adding cream. Not milk but full fat coffee cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dilutes your coffee a little bit, and suppresses any sour or overly bitter notes. Personally I like it even better than coffee without it because you get the softer coffee flavours that might usually be over powered in a standard coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also ask why the caffeine is important to you? Regular consumption doesn't improve one's concentration as the body normalises to it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would consult your doctor and seek their advice. Acid reflux can be just a mild irritation and easily managed but it can lead to more complicated issues -- such as Barrett's oesophagus. If you are that sensitive to caffeine you might want to leave it alone, or, restrict yourself to decaffeinated drinks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a good question, with answer, &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/4161/brew-a-less-acidic-coffee?rq=1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on the subject of brewing coffee with a lower acid content. It seems cold brew coffee could be the way to go!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Bad smelling coffee beans</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a bag of medium roasted coffee beans that is from a popular coffee chain to try to start grinding my own coffee. However, I've found that these beans smell a lot like dirt or even manure with some sort of nauseating nutty smell. This is very different from the same brand's ground coffee which has the usually good smelling coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a new bag, so I've decided not to purchase that brand again however I didn't think coffee could smell this way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the smell of this "dirty" scent of the coffee coming from? Is it from the roasting process? Would I get this if I were to roast my own beans?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Beans can smell like dirt, especially if they are beans that are known for having an earthy flavor profile. What you want to avoid are rancid smelling beans that can get that way due to the oils being over-oxidized over time. Alway check the roasted-on date and don't drink coffee that is several months old. If the bag has an expiration date instead of a roasted-on date, that means they don't want you know how long ago it was roasted. Don't buy those.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Espresso: How much can coffee choice affect the porosity of the coffee puck?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So this has happened to me: I bought a pack of pretty well-looking coffee, using the same approach as for other coffee beans (even the ones from the same &amp;quot;brand&amp;quot;) I prepared an espresso, and (to my surprise) got a coffee puck so unbelievably porous that all water just passed through it without any apparent resistance. Of course, no pressure means no crema and no real flavor was generated in this process, so I went for debugging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I tried changing the grind to &amp;quot;basically dust&amp;quot; (porlex 0 clicks :] ), trying all possible extraction schedules and pressures, tamping with &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more than 20 pounds of pressure, and cleaning my already clean grouphead just to be Super Sure, but all water just goes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All other coffee behaves normally (fortunately!). That leaves me wonder what's the actual problem. I can rule out a problem with the age of the beans (I've made reasonable coffee from older ones), and there's no roasting flaw that would be apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any known property of the coffee that affects the porosity this much? (I guess this can make sense for some preparation methods, but really not for espresso... I'm asking mainly for some possible extra coffee chemistry knowledge that I could have been missing, not really for debugging these precise beans -- I can use successfully them elsewhere.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there anything else to do with it, given I've already maxed out grind, weight, brewing pressure and all other things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADDITIONAL DETAILS (edit):
Beans were Indonesia Mandheling arabica, mix of several varieties, altitude 1100-1600m, wet-hulled. It seems they were roasted just under 2 months before the experiment, packaging seemed okay to me. The roast is relatively dark with a tiny bit of oil visible here and there (just below &amp;quot;full city&amp;quot; I'd guess). The bag has the usual degassing valve. The puck didn't look particularly chanelly (top: not perfectly level but no noticeable dents/holes or prominent problems, bottom: almost uniform color with a slightly &amp;quot;brighter&amp;quot; middle). I unfortunately don't have that particular coffee anymore to try more.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Answering my own problem -- the coffee was &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; improperly stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have acidentally reproduced the perfectly same problem with other (good) beans (RIP, beans). I accidentally left them in an open bag overnight in a relatively wet environment. The result could not hold water again, with all side effects as with the original problematic beans (not really good crema, ...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that the beans don't give any bloom, even if prepared as a brutal pour-over with 100C water. I kinda guess that the bloom (or anything related to it) caused some swelling in the coffee puck that just makes the water passage much harder. Alternate explanations welcome though.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is black coffee a solution, a colloid or a suspension?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've only gotten answers about normal coffee, like with milk in it. There is nothing about black coffee so could you help me? Is it a solution, colloid, or suspension?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;That depends how the coffee is prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee prepared via the drip method is typically a solution. You can dilute it as much as you like and will never find suspended solids. Coffee prepared in this way generally does not contain the fats and gasses that coffee prepared in other ways would because this method does not use pressurized extraction and because this method uses a paper filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee prepared as espresso through the use of a pressurized system like an espresso machine is all three things: a solution, a suspension, and a colloid. In these machines, paper filters are not used, which allows some of the oil from the beans and some very small fragments of grinds to be captured in the brew, creating a suspension. Also, the force of the pressurized extraction causes gasses in the bean to be extracted into the final brew, creating crema. The crema is a colloid of water, the aforementioned gasses, and the aforementioned fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other methods will produce varying results depending on the combination of brewing mechanism (pressure, immersion, or percolation) and use of a paper filter vs. metal filter.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Decipher Lavazza roast/batch code</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Can anyone help deciphering Lavazza coffee roasting / batch codes on ground coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bag on the left was great. The one on the right is bad enough I will return the several I bought. Both were bought from the same store, but 3 months apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8n2FR.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8n2FR.jpg" alt="batch codes on bag" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tasting was done side-by-side as I was finishing the old (left/good) bag &amp;amp; opening the new bag (right/bad) to make two separate cups via Aeropress, simultaneously. The difference was very obvious.  The new bag on right had no punctures / was still vacuum-sealed &amp;amp; airtight upon opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On day of tasting both coffees, left bag had been opened 10 days prior &amp;amp; stored in freezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bag on right was purchased 3 months later &amp;amp; freshly opened just prior to tasting its 1st cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Thoughts/Ideas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two digit number in the Batch Code (17 &amp;amp; 16), could that be week of production, counting down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i.e.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;52 - 17 = 35 = Aug 30 to Sep 5 (guessing for 2021)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;52 - 16 = 36 = Sep 6 to Sep 12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems unlikely.  There must be a ton of batches made every week.  And none of the other letters (numbers) changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any insight or ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; = Factory / production location code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; = year: 2021 (E = 2022)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt; = day of month&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt; = month: 8 (August)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L&lt;/strong&gt; = not sure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in this case, the beans on the left were produced on 17/8/2021 and the ones on the right on 16/8/2021. Being fresher by 1 day wouldn't explain the difference in taste, so you'd have to put it down to either bad storage or to a different batch/source of beans being used at the factory.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does pouring hot espresso over ice "shock" it, or is that a myth?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently got an espresso maker and now tend to make iced lattes every morning. I make the espresso, pour it into a glass with ice, and then add milk. A friend came to stay with me recently and wanted an iced latte as well. When I told her how I made them she said her partner, who's a barista, never pours hot espresso over ice as it &amp;quot;shocks&amp;quot; the espresso and changes the flavor. She says it makes it more bitter, and you should either wait for the espresso to cool a little or mix it with the milk first to bring its temperature down before adding the ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a little experiment by making two iced lattes, one with hot espresso and one with room-temperature espresso I had made an hour before and left out to cool. I couldn't taste the difference. I'm also skeptical that rapidly cooling something would change its flavor. I've looked at &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/42u1lr/shocking_the_espresso_and_your_thoughts/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;reddit threads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.baristaexchange.com/forum/topics/shocking-the-espresso" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this thread from Barista Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, and have seen mixed opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, does pouring hot espresso over ice &amp;quot;shock&amp;quot; it and make it bitter, and if so, why?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The explained method is known as the Japanese brewing extended to espresso. Actually, this is discussed before here to some degree. So, please also take a look at that as it may help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2964/extending-the-japanese-brewing-method-to-espresso"&gt;Extending the Japanese Brewing Method to Espresso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple answer is: yes, pulling a shot directly on ice should affect the taste. However, I have never heard a term as &lt;em&gt;shocking the espresso&lt;/em&gt;. Fundamentally, Japanese brewing is applied to keep more fruity flavors (if there exist any) intact by not letting them evaporate right after pulling the shot. Therefore, based on this explanation, it should smell less but taste a bit more fruity. One should not expect a bitter taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final word, I would like to add a speculation. This is not based on observation but pure reasoning: If the roast is dark, very probably you already lost the fruity flavors and ice might help to keep the burnt flavor a bit more. So, the final result could be bitter maybe?&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;My husband likes pour overs more than a drip coffee and i am wondering what are the differences in flavor profile and the differences in methods of how they are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could one potentially taste the differences if they were blindfolded?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have tried all sorts of different brewing methods and here are the differences I’ve noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With pour over, you are in control/responsible for a lot of variables, from the water temperature, blooming, grind size (if you’re grinding your own beans), and pouring flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With drip method using a traditional method, you get more consistency but less variables to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed a difference in richness/flavour extracted with pour over (granted you follow typical methods of blooming and slowish pour rate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taste is subjective so I can’t speak to what is “better”, but there should be a difference in taste given the method.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do various factors interact in preparation?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Obviously, differencies in a bunch of parameters yield variance in flavour and acidity? This is not only temperature, but also time (from the rapid espresso to Cezve to all-nighter cold brews), amount and grind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few discussions dedicated to some of them (&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/16/277"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/3/277"&gt;water hardness&lt;/a&gt;, time for &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/415/277"&gt;espresso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/297/277"&gt;french press&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/385/277"&gt;the cup&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if there are any interesting ways for them to interact. For instance, a coarser ground would take more time to get the result. Which other things can or cannot be rescued in this fashion? Say, get rich aroma if I only have light roast beans, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine that there is no short or definitive answer, but any ideas are appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roasted&lt;/em&gt; coffee beans (from which you'd brew coffee as usual) are certainly edible -- &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate-covered_coffee_bean" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;chocolate-covered coffee beans&lt;/a&gt; are an example. They don't need any different or additional processing beyond ordinary roasting; I'm guessing that was what was in your bar. Chew a whole roasted coffee bean; does it taste similar?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does some coffee "hit me" harder than other coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've had all types of coffee, but certain brands or preparations seem to get me more 'speeded up' (like Starbucks coffee) than others. What causes certain coffee to be more "stimulating" than other coffee? Is is the caffeine content? How it's brewed? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of concrete factors that will impact the stimulation you get from a cup of coffee, but it probably boils down to &lt;strong&gt;the amount of caffeine (and any other stimulants) that are in your cup&lt;/strong&gt; that get extracted from the beans. Here's a few factors that affect the caffeine content of coffee, with links to other related questions on this site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain beans have more caffeine (themselves, per mass) than others, so there's more of it to get extracted into the cup;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain roasts (e.g., lighter) have more caffeine than others (see also &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/29/what-type-of-roast-has-the-lowest-caffeine-content"&gt;lowest-caffeine roast&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/79/how-can-i-figure-out-how-much-caffeine-is-in-my-cup"&gt;calculating caffeine content&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain preparation methods have more caffeine (e.g., &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/128/what-preparation-method-yields-the-most-caffeine"&gt;caffeine content of preparation methods&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are factors in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1564/what-do-the-terms-extraction-and-strength-mean"&gt;strength and extraction&lt;/a&gt; -- e.g., more grounds and higher extraction will generally provide more caffeine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm lumping this all under "caffeine", but there are probably other stimulants in coffee besides caffeine (e.g., as suggested in &lt;a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/106/23/2935.full" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; and others). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there's the intangible factors in "stimulation", such as marketing, cafe atmosphere, and so forth, which might have some other kind of effect (like "conditioning" or other "mind games") that might help you &lt;em&gt;feel like&lt;/em&gt; the coffee is even more stimulating than it would be otherwise. These veer off-topic too much to discuss further.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Vaccum container and dispenser?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is there a vacuum container that can dispense coffee without letting air in so I don't have to vacuum it everytime I need to make coffee?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S., English is not my first language. Feel free to rephrase the question and correct grammar/spelling mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I do not believe such a product exists at a consumer level for dispensing coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, you would need a vacuum-sealed container that also incorporates some sort of outlet corridor where the coffee could enter, which would then need to be sealed from the inside before dispensing the coffee. It would be like an "air lock" in a miniature coffee spacecraft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if this is simply a labor-saving effort, &lt;strong&gt;there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; touchless, automatic vacuum-sealed containers&lt;/strong&gt; that re-establish the vacuum every time you close it (search &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=automatic+vacuum+container" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=automatic+vacuum+container&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on a broader note, if you find reestablishing the vacuum each time a bit more trouble than you would like, you might &lt;strong&gt;consider removing a few-days supply at a time,&lt;/strong&gt; and just storing what you need in a regular air-tight container for your short-term daily use. Vacuum-sealing is optimal for longer-term storage, but I don't think you will find a &lt;em&gt;perceptible&lt;/em&gt; loss of quality over a few days if you keep enough for your immediate needs in a regular air-tight container. &lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The caffeine content of your coffee will depend on the variety, the method of extraction and the roast of your beans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see on this &lt;a href="http://journals.ju.edu.jo/DirasatHum/article/viewFile/1805/1793" rel="nofollow"&gt;paper about caffeine contents of turkish coffee&lt;/a&gt; on table 7, that unroasted coffee releases almost no caffeine, while dark roast gives the best release. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://www.coffeedetective.com/caffeine-in-coffee.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; also has an interesting comparison on the caffeine content of different varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've talked to coffee producers who've told me that Geisha has 35% less caffeine than tipica, and there is a variety of Laurina that has only 25% of the caffeine found in tipica. 
I haven't been able to find data on this, but I did find a little &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11711066" rel="nofollow"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; that points to it being in the right neigboardhood.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I guess measure density just like you would in a college-lab? Just use a graduated cylinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extraction is mostly about how efficiently you can extract coffee solubles with an amount of liquid. Since refractometers are pricy, you can use a 0.1g scale and a graduated cylinder, to measure how heavy your shots are. The denser the better, however you also have to be practical with how long your shots take to be pulled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional information on the chemistry of coffee taste. This is produced by what we know as the Maillard Reaction -  the Maillard Reaction (MRx). Discovered by a French chemist in 1910 the MRx is what is largely responsible for transforming the mere handful of compounds found in green coffee (unroasted) to the complex aromatic beverage that it is today. As temperatures reach 150°C (302°F) the MRx causes free proteins to combine with sugars to form aromatic compounds such as furans which impart sweet, caramel like notes to the coffee. &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mWOtZ.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mWOtZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;From what your question seems to be asking - I believe that grinding your coffee more coarse is all that needs to be done.

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to substitute this for the &lt;a href="http://www.sageappliances.co.uk/descaler.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;the Descaler&lt;/a&gt; that the Sage machine uses? If so, how would I go about doing so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chemical composition of the Gaggia Descaler is (proportions unspecified):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citric acid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lactic acid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corrosion inhibitor&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Yes, there's a double 'the' in there. It is called 'the Descaler', presumably as the appliance it's used with is called 'the Oracle')&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think the Gaggia Descaler would work fine in any espresso machine. Just use the same procedure and amount that worked for the Gaggia machine (or use the directions for The Oracle). &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Breville Smart Grinder Pro setting for cold drip</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to find the best grind size to use in my Bruer cold drip setup.
I bought a Breville Smart Grinder Pro (highly recommended).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone used this grinder before, and if so what grind size would be the best for cold drip?  Thanks&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;While I do not own a Smart Grinder Pro, most local places that make cold brew/drip use a medium-fine grind. This picture below can give you a good illustration on how coarse you want your bean. 
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2xmcZ.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2xmcZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is really preference, however, I have found that too fine of a grind (like espresso) will usually muddy up a filter and make it harder to pass through due to the lack of pressure. I am sure there is a setting guide either that comes with the box or online that you can use for drip/cold drip. Just remember to keep it coarse enough so that it does not come out too "powdery".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image source: &lt;a href="http://www.bruer.co/blogs/news/12222337-cold-bruer-experiments-with-grind-size" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.bruer.co/blogs/news/12222337-cold-bruer-experiments-with-grind-size&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: My recommendation is to use the "Drip Grind" coarseness. That means, a grind that is not as powdered down as espresso; grinds should be no larger that ~1-1.5mm in diameter. Usually the finer a grind is, the more pressure is needed to account for the surface area created.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have this exact brewer. This may seem counterintuitive, but I would suggest removing the lid from the carafe before pouring. The lid has a narrow rectangular notch through which the coffee passes during pour, and it is the shape of the notch that causes the splash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bunn has actually had a couple of versions of the BTX-BT carafe, and the current design is focused on maximum thermal retention. Unfortunately, the trade-off is difficult pour control.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the difference between the terms percolation and brewing in English?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Percolation and brewing seem used quite interchangeably in English, in many contexts, but not all. For example, I can often see "percolation time" in technical documents or Wikipedia entries, but often hear "brewing time" as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any usage guidelines for these words in the English coffee world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that percolation and brewing are not just about coffee: Both terms are generic. Percolation sounds more technical and focusing on liquid getting through a filter. Brewing seems focusing more on "solid into hot water", without involving necessarily a filter. This lets me think the words usage can be made quite accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that the scope is "restricted" to English, as percolation is a Latin word, and it seems usage differs in English.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Brewing is a part of every coffee preparation method: it's the time when the water (or steam) is in contact with the grounds. It is a generic term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Percolation however, would only be used when making percolator coffee. You would not talk about percolation time when making espresso, for example. I would not use it as a generic term.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What coffee bean and roast are appropriate with soy milk?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Soy milk tastes quite different from cow milk. Yet coffee chains seem to make their milk-based drinks from the same coffee pot. The pot is most often made of dark-roast blends "from the house", and it seems a good match for cow milk, as the fatty flavour balances the strength of the black drink. Dark-roast blends coffee seems overly strong for soy milk, though, and I am guessing that some cafes do serve "soy lattes" based on lighter roasts (from taste, not from observation at this point).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blends are usually secrets in contents and proportions. The chains use the same pot anyway, but some cafes may be picking a different blend as well, more suitable to the flavour profile of soy milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any criteria on the bean and/or roast when one intends to mix with soy milk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This question may seem subjective. The goal is to understand what concrete parameters are "available" to make a drink that preserves the coffee qualities and merges nicely with the soy milk flavour profile.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Though it's not primarily your question, my chief problem with soy(a) milk in coffee is with curdling &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/425/how-to-avoid-soya-milk-curdling-in-coffee"&gt;as described in this question&lt;/a&gt;. I have noticed curdling especially in higher-acidity coffee -- e.g., especially in American-origin coffees and lighter-roasted coffees. No matter the preparation, I avoid soy milk in anything lighter than full-city roast. The resulting grainy texture is simply unacceptable! Though admittedly certain brands are less likely to split, especially if steamed, frothed, emulsified etc. as in for certain drinks like latte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darker-roast coffees are more common ("popular") &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt; at mass-market chains, so I think that can also explain some of the prevalence of dark roasts for soy milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for taste, fat content and sugar content vary greatly for soy milk, even when discounting other additives like vanilla or other flavourings... so go for an unsweetened, un-flavoured brand. For my preference, the nuttier taste of soy milk is a good complement for Indonesian or other southeast-Asian coffees, which can be earthy, nutty, toasty, and take to darker-roasting well. Flavour guides &lt;a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/06/coffee-flavor-profiles-major-growing-regions-guatemala-kenya-brazil-ethiopia.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;such as this one from Serious Eats&lt;/a&gt; can help identify general characteristics. If you like a pairing of soy milk with some other food, look for a coffee that expresses that same characteristic!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How big of a difference is there between a pressurised and non-pressurised portafilter?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been trouble shooting some of my own espresso and realised that my lower-end machine might just be unable to make a better shot due to having a pressurised portafilter. So with that I wanted to find out what real differences having an unpressurised portafilter there are compared with a pressurised one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those interested, my current espresso problems are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I manage to get the grind to a size where I'm noticing good thin mouse tail pours but the lack of thick, golden brown crema makes me think I can get a better shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've read that light coloured crema or thin crema is a symptom of underextraction, depending on the length of the shot (where mine was in and around 20 seconds for a double shot, so relatively fast). I then ground finer and the extraction immediately changed. The mouse tails disappeared and the extraction was fast, almost instantly blonding within a second of the extraction. Liquid was not pouring out extremely fast but in comparison with the slower previous extraction it was relatively fast. I tried to continue to lower the grind size to attempt to slow the extraction but to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could this be a problem with the pressurised portafilter?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Pressurized portafilters either restrict water flow or require a certain buildup of pressure before the espresso spills out the bottom of the portafilter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are several problems with that taste-wise in espresso. The resistance is now not in the ground coffee itself, but below it. Additionally, if your coffee is ground finely and uniformly in a good espresso grinder (as one would for a non-pressurized portafilter), this sort of portafilter will result in too much resistance and thus a slow, over-extracted shot. It can also make your crema look a bit odd because it can emulsify some of the oils in your extracted shot (depending on the design of the specific portafilter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially the requisite grind size to produce acceptable espresso using a pressurized portafilter is much larger than that of optimal or delicious espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of portafilter does have its upsides, though. If you don't have access to a quality espresso grinder, and you are using either store-ground beans or imprecisely/more coarsely ground beans, a pressurized portafilter can make acceptable espresso from them whereas the results in a standard portafilter would be very watery and underextracted.&lt;/p&gt;

So, you may try to prepare a &lt;strong&gt;Doppio&lt;/strong&gt; (double espresso) to make a stronger beverage. Here is a quick &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppio" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;wiki link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the link in the previous item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There should be a button for that on such machines. At least, I hope there is one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Barista Classes</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There are several courses available for aspiring baristas to take.  I am interested in opening a farmer's market coffee stand, I have zero Barista experience, however some of these courses are very pricey but are backed by organizations such as the Specialty Coffee Association of America.  I have come across other options at local community colleges under the Barista I and II guise.  At the surface, these two classes do not look that much different, is there anything specifically that I should look for when enrolling in a course like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From SCAA, Barista I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Learn the basics of espresso preparation, milk, and drink building in the Level 1 Barista Pathway. With access to the best tools, coffees, and industry leaders, Level 1 Barista students receive expertly lead training and a comprehensive introduction to the espresso craft.&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a local community college, extension program&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Learn about coffee, how to prepare and serve espresso and espresso based drinks. Program will show how to use espresso/cappuccino machine at a commercial level, and will make you confident around coffee and equipment. Completion of Barista program will include a Basic Barista Certification, which can be used for employment referral.
Class will be instructed by a Specialty Coffee Consultant, who has more than 15 years of experience in Italian espresso, espresso equipment (at an engineering level)and barista training in over 80 restaurants and coffee shops.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The SCAA-certified classes will be of more benefit to you if you're looking for employment at a coffee shop as a barista, roaster, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that you're interested in learning the fundamentals of coffee in order to open a farmers market coffee stand, I would say go with the cheaper option. Both will teach you what it is you seek, but only one will set you back thousands of dollars gaining certifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; The SCAA has strict guidelines that some coffee shops simply cannot meet for reasons of cost or another. From the &lt;a href="http://scaaeducation.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SCAA's education website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Campus locations have successfully completed the &lt;strong&gt;SCAA Certified Teaching Laboratory program&lt;/strong&gt;, demonstrating a calibrated teaching environment to teach within &lt;strong&gt;SCAA standards and protocols&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campuses also are &lt;strong&gt;required to employ only SCAA Certified Specialized Instructors&lt;/strong&gt; for class offerings, ensuring the highest quality of instruction regardless of which Campus a student attends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, an excellent instructor with all the best equipment who can't afford to take the SCAA classes or meet the space requirements for a teaching space can't teach said classes.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What gives coffee its acidic (sour) taste?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I read somewhere that too cold water is what gives coffee its acidity, how does that take place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, does that apply only to the water during the brewing process or as my cup of coffee cools down, the acidity increase?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;That's correct: as your cup cools, perceived acidity increases. This is due to variation in the chemical species affected by temperature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee is like ice cream. Ice cream is least sweet when it's stone cold, and tart and heavy when it has melted. Similarly, coffee is sweetest (and best) while it's hot, and is bitter or acrid when it has cooled. Furthermore, the cooler temp has led to chemical degradation and thus the awful taste. However, you won't perceive its flavors when the coffee is too hot -- so let it cool a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for your question whether the on-contact brew temperature affects end-result sweetness-sourness: there are a lot of baristas and coffee R&amp;amp;D pros who do temperature-control brewing, especially for espresso, in order to modify the flavor of the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that varying temperature affects coffee flavor in a gradient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For cold brew (in case you're also curious about that), the cold temperature is a different environment entirely. Coffee is just as soluble, however less energetically kinetic, so more time is substituted for the lack of temperature. The end result is a brew product that functions naturally as a cold product -- nice, sweet, characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the reasonable size for a coffee ground particle?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am looking at the following coffee grinders: Macap MXK conical burr grinder, Mazzer Robur conical burr grinder, and Mazzer Super Jolly flat burr grinder that supposedly produce a low particle size of the ground coffee. I came across an experiment (&lt;a href="http://www.home-barista.com/reviews/titan-grinder-project-particle-size-distributions-of-ground-coffee-t4203.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that showed the ground coffee particle size after being placed in water was about 10 micron (in diameter) on average. This seemed dubious to me and the post hasn't been active in 9 years so I was wondering if anyone knows if this is reasonable and if you have any recommendation for coffee grinders that produce a low particle size?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You're mis-interpreting the significance of the results in the cited experiment. There were also statistically controlled follow up experiments (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.home-barista.com/grinders/tgp-ii-particle-distribution-analysis-of-grinder-adjustments-interim-results-t15698.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that studied grinder particle size distribution in more detail on the same site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently even when very precise uni-modal particle size regulation is achieved as is the case with industrial roller miller grinders, particle sizes must be deliberately blended for espresso grinds to achieve the required bi-modal distribution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bi-modal size distribution is crucial for proper espresso extraction where the coffee bed (espresso puck) is subject to approx 10 bar water pressure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your intent in asking for grinder recommendations capable of producing small particle sizes appears to be based on the mistaken assumption that this is the normal working range for grinders. It is not. A good espresso grinder needs to have a well-defined bi-modal distribution with the largest volume of coarse (approx 500u)  and a smaller volume of fine (approx 50u) particles. And a bulk (brewed coffee) grinder should have a tighter unimodal distribution and a working range of about 100 - 1000u. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first plot above is the particle size distribution by volume in the OP cited experiment showing the characteristic espresso grinder bi-modal curve with average particle size peaks at approximately 500u and 50u. The second graph shows the bi-modal distribution for a Robur espresso grinder from a subsequent experiment (TGPII, Robur). And the third graph shows a high resolution plot from a instrumentation manufacturer (Sympatec).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the specific grinders that the OP was considering, all three are well known and respected commercial espresso grinders. FWIW, large conical grinders are easier to use and produce more consistent results. But all would work well for espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7UxEY.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7UxEY.jpg" alt="Espresso shot"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Why these things matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High quality bulk coffee grinders by contrast show a tighter, uni-modal size distribution at the selected size. The usual working range for brewed coffee is about &lt;a href="http://www.ditting.com/suggested_settings.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;100u - 900u&lt;/a&gt; (Turkish - French press).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the ground coffee particle size after being placed in water was about
  10 micron (in diameter) on average&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10u can only be said to be the average particle size &lt;em&gt;by count&lt;/em&gt;. It must be noted however that the proportion of 10u particles by volume is minuscule. A meaningful characterization of average particle size needs to be done by volume or distribution, the former has a strong correlation with expert taste tests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to maintain the flow rate of Hario Woodneck cloth filters as they age?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The Hario Woodneck brewer uses cloth filters that are not meant to last forever but I am looking to increase their usable age. As weeks pass, the flow rate of water through the filter noticeably slows down. In a brand new filter it seems almost constant from full to empty, but after a month or so the last bit takes ages to drain. What should I be doing to keep them 'alive' longer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using the ones in the image if it matters. These are inserted to the hoop provided with the Woodneck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a98mr.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a98mr.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before first use I soak the filter in boiling water for a few minutes as instructed. After each use I rinse it with hot water. Between uses I store the filter in a ziplock bag in the freezer.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Try putting a glob of coconut oil on the filter and then sprinkle a little baking soda and salt on too. Scrub with a stiff plastic toothbrush/nailbrush followed by a warm vinegar/lemon juice dosing, a final brushing, then a hot water rinse. This works well for ceramic mug coffee stains too :-) &lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>What are the standard espresso parameters (dose, mass/volume, time, etc.)?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Breville Infuser espresso machine as well as a Breville Smart Grinder Pro. The espresso machine comes with two types of filters (for singles and doubles), and can dispense a pre-programmed volume of water corresponding to a single or double dose through its two front buttons (the machine also allows programming these volumes, if desired.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus there are 4 combinations of coffee I could produce:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a single filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a single dose (~30 ml, as I understand).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a double filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a single dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a single filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a double dose (~60 ml, as I understand).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a double filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a double dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are any of these 4 cases not usual or "recommended"? Particularly I never brew the combination corresponding to case 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the expected flavor profile of the espresso produced in each of these cases (more/less acid, sour, sweet, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of these could be called a ristretto, normale, or lungo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What parameters should I aim for in each of these cases, in terms of: mass of grounds in the filter before brewing (in g), shot volume (in ml) or mass (in g) in the cup, and extraction time (in s)? I have heard extraction times should be always 25 s regardless of the coffee dose and the volume of water, so 25 s for all combinations above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This machine has a pressure gauge, indicating water pressure during extraction. Should I watch for a particular value in this gauge, or ignore it and just watch the extraction time? Currently my procedure for adjusting the grind is to make it coarser when pressure is in the upper 2/3rds of the gauge range, and finer when pressure is in the lower 1/3rd of the gauge range. I do not regularly monitor extraction time for adjusting the grind. Using combination 4, and adjusting the grind such that the pressure gauge stays close to the midpoint, extraction times are in the range of 25-30 s. However, using the same grind settings but dosing enough water for a single (combination 2), extraction times are closer to 15 s. To get closer to 25 s I would have to let the pressure gauge reach values way into the upper range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing: although I enjoy the taste of combination 2, it appears most of the water stays in the coffee puck, and the volume actually dispensed in the cup is very small (about 15-20 ml). Perhaps I should reprogram the water volume to get something closer to, say, 30 ml? Would this help me get an extraction time closer to 25 s for this dose (assuming this is the "ideal" extraction time)?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The question is a very complex one, so I will try to answer with a standard approach of dialing in your espresso. Generally speaking what you should aim for is a espresso that is full bodied, sweet, fruity with crisp acidity, a syrupy mouth feel and an amazing aftertaste that stays with you long after you finished the cup. What you don't want to get are any sour (underextraction), bitter (overextraction), ashy flavors and a hollow aftertaste that leaves you wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get to that sweet spot different ways, using the single shot or double shot portafilter. There are some general guidelines though that you might want to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally using a double shot porta filter delivers better results. You are more flexibel in adjusting the grind size for example. In basically all specialty coffee shops, double shot baskets are used for making espressos. Surely this has to do with efficiency as well, since you can make 2 shots at the same time. I would suggest you try to find the sweet spot with your combination number 4 (or number 1 if you really don't want any more than a single espresso).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing you have to consider is your recipe. Using a double shot basket what you should aim for is a dose:yield ratio of around 1:2. That means if you start with 20g of coffee (in the double basket), aim for a 40ml yield (for a double espresso). A very common recipe would be to start with an 18g dose and aim for a 36g yield. That would be a double shot or two single shots. If you pull shorter you will get a ristretto (short espresso) and if you push through more water, it would be a lungo. The yield is not fixed, you may adjust it depending on the coffee and taste. It is just a basis for dialing in properly, a baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you decided on a recipe you should lock in the dose. Changing the dose, changes everything else, so you want to keep it as consistent as possible. However the grams are not fixed and will change all the time. If you change the coffee type/brand/origin/roast etc. you will have to adjust again. Even variables such as temperature, humidity and how much coffee is in the basket above the grind chamber will influence your grinders behavior and therefore the dose. The only definitive remedy is weighing out every single dose and shot (for home use at least whenever you use new coffee to find a setup that delivers consistently good results with this brand or type, albeit it will not consistently be optimal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have the dose and recipe fixed you want to get an extraction time of somewhere between 20 and 30 seconds. Adjust the grind size (keep in mind that your dose changes as well, when you adjust the size, since the grinder measures the time of grinding and not the weight of the coffee) so that you reach the desired extraction time with the given recipe. Don't overdo it though and stay in the espresso grind range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that you tamp correctly. Level out the grounds before tamping with slight shaking, hitting the basket on the sides and using your fingers. Try to tamp as straight as possible, the distance between the basket and the edge of the tamper should be equal on all sides. A tilted puck will extract badly. You don't have to tamp terribly hard, just until you don't feel the coffee bed changing any more. Anything more is redundant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pull a shot, taste and reflect if the result is the coffee you want. If it is, good for you, most likely it isn't though and you will have to adjust again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it isn't the coffee you want, try to figure out what's wrong with it. Is it too sour? Probably underextracted. Try to grind slightly finer, so the extraction process takes a few seconds longer to get to the yield you want. Does it taste bitter and hollow? Probably overextraced, in this case do the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forget everything of the above and follow your taste buds! If one or more of those things doesn't produce taste profiles that you like, just kind of ignore them and try something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a general approach of how to dial in your grinder and produce a nice shot. It is not the only one, it is definitely incomplete and it will not be able to replace experimenting and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also don't bother too much about the pressure at the beginning, try to get consistent results that you like when pulling shots and after a while you will learn and understand your machine better. Also don't forget to flush the group head and portafilter before use, so old coffee oils are removed and you get up to temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the espresso extract has been dripping out really slowly and it takes about 10-15 minutes to fill half a cup. I tried to clean the machine like the manual says (operate without a capsule - just on water), although this is something I do on a weekly basis, just to maintain my machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had this machine since April 2012. Could it be that it is too old?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It sounds like your machine needs to be descaled.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled this from the documentation on their &lt;a href="http://www.lavazza.com/default/.content/document/pdf/manuali/manuale_favola_plus_aeg.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your machine will need descaling on a regular basis (approximately every 3 months) to
  ensure it is working efficiently and to prevent any major technical faults developing. This is a simple process and will have immediate results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is if you can get water through it you can get it going again. The descaled works by desolving the calcium deposits in the machine and letting the water flow freely again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, during Turkish brewing process, the grounds are &lt;strong&gt;boiled*&lt;/strong&gt; for minutes (and legendarily up to hours) to produce a bitter flavored coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result is a very dark and intense beverage which can be consumed in very small amounts in small cups.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refractometers&lt;/strong&gt; are widely used to measure the opaqueness of the coffee during brewing to timely determine the extraction time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spectrophotometers&lt;/strong&gt; are used to measure color instead of opaqueness. They are mostly useful to determine the roast degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in my opinion, &lt;strong&gt;perfect&lt;/strong&gt; is something defined by personal preference when considered with coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to find the perfect roast degree, you may choose your specific beans first, specific brewing method, etc. Then choose the specific roast degree. After that, a spectrophotometer may help you to find that exact point each time you &lt;em&gt;repeat&lt;/em&gt; the roasting process. Similar to that, during brewing, a refractometer may help you to find that previously decided specific point each time you &lt;em&gt;repeat&lt;/em&gt; that brewing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, there is no guidance you can hear as &lt;em&gt;the perfect point&lt;/em&gt; that you can scientifically lean on. But you may hear some advice based on the coffee community's common experience. Generally, if you are not into industrial production, you don't generally need nerdy equipment to follow such advise.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does coffee taste different when it is ground at home?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is there a difference in the taste of the coffee that I grind myself versus the ground coffee that I buy from the store? Does the size of the ground change the taste of the coffee that I brew?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I bypass the first question.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, ground size considerably affects the taste of the final cup. In general, there's a common rule of five component for a good cup of coffee. Each component must require its precedent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good beans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good roasting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homogenously/correct-sized grinding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correct equipment&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated above, the grounds must be all at the same size. Moreover they must be the correct size. The finest for Turkish, a bit less fine for espresso, boulders are good for French press, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I talked to homebrewing supply stores looking for "Guinness mix" or "beer gas" pre-filled bottles for sale. While this isn't a pure 100% mix, it's about 75/25 or 70/30 and usually means the supplier mixed it for them. After a lot of digging at homebrew suppliers, I found that one of their suppliers does smaller batch orders, which can be difficult since fequently breweries sign up for a delivery schedule with large gas suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gas supplier is an industrial welding and gas supply store -- don't let "industrial" in the name dissuade you from calling and asking about food/medical grade. This industrial supplier also has food grade tank exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I make a good flat white?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Recently Starbucks Canada has started serving Flat Whites and after cursorily reading about how to  make one on Wikipedia, I thought I'd try my hand at it at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a Breville Cafe Roma Espresso machine and I thought that perhaps if I steam the milk for really really long, and start with only half the cup full it would create the microfoam a Flat White needs. I also tried to replicate a ristretto technique by essentially stopping the shot at 2/3rds of what I would normally pull - so stopping at the 20 seconds mark instead of at the 30 seconds mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not bad, but not exactly like Starbucks, although it came out brutally hot because the milk was very hot and I poured both the milk and microfoam into the espresso. Thinking I need to put only the microfoam next time. Anyone have any tips on how to make a perfect flat white at home?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Good is completely subjective, so I cannot comment on that part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You already mentioned two basic components: ristretto and the microfoam. These should do the flat white. However, I may have a useful hint for useful microfoam. Check whether you can spill the microfoam directly on top of ristretto. If you can't and you require a spoon or something similar, then it is not wet enough.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;How does the humidity affect the length of time required to reach a good light roast in a gas fired roaster. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I believe heat and humidity play a key role in the role of energy transference in the roaster. I roast (professionally)in a very dry climate and find it easier (more forgiving) to roast in a climate that generally has a more humidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to a conversation about heating and humidity that hopefully will help answer your question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the 3rd answer is the most appropriate in its relation to heat transfer and "other" objects in a room (i.e. Coffee beans).&lt;/p&gt;

It will take water, activate the pump, then it will just stay on the step with the red heating light on.  I've let it sit for 15 minutes and it doesn't do anything.  Usually it's just a few minutes before the blue cup lights turn on.  Usually you can hear noise after the pumping which indicates the heating component is warming up the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most conventional advice online only talks about descaling, getting air out of the tubes, and cleaning the metal punch that goes into the k-cups.  So far I've unseated the water container, emptied it, refilled it, reseated it on the coffee maker, detached it again, turned the coffee maker over, tried giving it a few whacks to see if it would knock any buildup loose, and none of these did anything.  The coffee maker is out of warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Taste of coffee that has not rested long enough</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of speculation about how long to allow coffee to rest after roasting prior to cupping, see &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3013/roast-profile-vs-rest-time-any-connection" title="here"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://here" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, and it has been discussed at length at home barista and other places too. But how would you describe the flavor of coffee that has not had adequate resting time? From experience with a particular bean generally roasted to City it seems that the flavor is tainted at 2 days. It is a much cleaner cup after 3-4 days. But I have trouble describing that particular flavor in SCAA terms other than "taint". It seems to be vaguely salty + a lot of something else very destinctive that I can not describe. I would like to be able to detect and describe that flavor when I move to another bean and profile to be able to better know whether the profile/batch was a dud or I need to recup in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;To me, the more likely result of insufficient "rest time" is a lack of flavor. It tastes like coffee, but without enough depth of flavor. In that case, I will simply let it rest for two days, then try the coffee again. Usually there is a noticeable improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the flavor will not improve with more rest. That means that I did not roast the bean far enough. So I make a note to roast a bit longer (10 to 15 seconds) next time.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Physiologically, as soon as substances enter the body, they are being processed, entering your system and subsequently removed from it. By that logic, you will experience the greatest net effect of the caffeine content of your cup of coffee by finishing it in the shortest amount of time possible. This is assuming that your definition of 'best kick' is indeed attempting to feel the most potent effects of the caffeine available in your cup.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;One method is to use submerge your grounded beans in water for 24 hours and use a traditional cone filter.  Place the filter in a pour over cylinder if you have one and that will remove the grounds while leaving you the sweet, sweet cold brew nectar.  If you don't have  cylinder, you can definitely use a filter in your desired cup, just be careful with how you place it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>EK43 settings for shop grinding</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if anyone has a list of EK43 grind settings for different brew methods that they use for pre grinding coffee bags for customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that pre grinding can be complicated for all sorts of reasons (different brew methods/preferences etc.) but figure customers who are ok with pre ground are also ok with not getting perfect extractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no one has already done the hard work, I'll post what I end up with after playing around with different settings for different brew methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance to anyone that can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; All information below is entirely based on my adjustment to make 11 be a french press / cupping grind thus normalizing the rest of the settings.  How I came up with the adjustment was because at the time I had my home grinder configured for french press and was using it daily, and I simply did a comparison of grind levels until the adjustment appeared to be the same size.  Given a normalized 11 setting, everything else should match up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first purchased my EK43, I felt that it did not allow coarse enough grinding to get to French press level grinds.  I pulled the tap screws on the grind adjustment knob and and loosened the burrs equivalent of 2 grind units (effectively making grind level 3 originally a 1).  This adjusted the grinder such that an 11 was a French press grind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is configured, and presuming you are using the 'new' EK43 burrs, I use the following settings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11 - French Press and cupping samples&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.5-8 - Drip brew and Keurig depending on desired strength.  This setting will also work with Bunn brewers IF the user uses the proper amount of grounds, which almost no one does.. For 110oz airpots we were using 175g grounds at a 7.5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.5 - For those stubborn people who use half as many grounds as they are supposed to on Bunn brewers..  I've got a few companies like this, and have to grind fine, otherwise the coffee comes out underextracted.  I wish I could just tell them to double the amount of coffee they put in the machine but.. oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This setup is basically useless for espresso grinding.  It works halfway decent if you are using a pressurized portafilter (like an EC155 or something) If someone asked for an espresso level grind on this setup, I would give them a 1 and it would be quite fine, but probably wouldn't be clumping at all. No one discerning enough to know the differences in espresso grinds is going to ask for it pre-ground anyways so I just ignore this bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these settings are with basically brand new burrs.. of course as they wear, I will have to adjust accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Calculate diluted concentration of cold-brew</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Imagine I produce a concentrated Cold-Brew, with a 1:4 ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I make a cup of diluted cold-brew that contains the standard ratio (1:15) ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the response consider explaining the math with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100grs of concentrated Cold-brew (brewed with 1:4 ratio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achieve a final beverage of 500grs (&lt;strong&gt;must have&lt;/strong&gt; a 1:15)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I don't think that is as simple as adding &lt;em&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;n&lt;/strong&gt; remaining parts&lt;/em&gt;, that's the reason why I'm asking this.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The math is fairly simple. You know for how much concentrated cold brew you will be using that it is at a ratio of 1:4. Since the resulting concentration of the cold brew is constant (since it has already been brewed) we only really care about the parts of water that are in it; 4 parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore to calculate how much water you need to add to dilute your 1:4 concentrate into a 1:15 cup, divide the amount of concentrate you are using by 4 and then multiply that by the remaining parts you wish to add, which is &lt;code&gt;15 - 4 = 11&lt;/code&gt; which gives you the amount of water you need to add in whatever units you measured the amount of concentrate you started with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using your example numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with 100g of cold brew concentrate at 1:4 ratio. Each part of water is therefore &lt;code&gt;100/4 = 25g&lt;/code&gt;. The amount of water you will need to add is therefore &lt;code&gt;11 x 25g = 275g&lt;/code&gt; to result in a total amount of 375g in your final cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the final answer by doing a reverse calculation. If the concentrate is 1:4 and you have 100g of it, it means you started with 25g of ground coffee. Therefore making a 1:15 ratio cup of coffee with 25g of coffee means &lt;code&gt;25g x 15 = 375g&lt;/code&gt; of water must be added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers align.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an amount of cold brew to be diluted, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;units&lt;/em&gt;, which has a coffee-to-water ratio of &lt;code&gt;1:n&lt;/code&gt;, the amount of each part of water in the cold brew, &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;c/n&lt;/code&gt;. The amount of water to be added to achieve a final ratio of &lt;code&gt;1:m&lt;/code&gt; is therefore &lt;code&gt;w x (m-n)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;units&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Units&lt;/em&gt; are any form of measure of the liquid mass being used, in g, mL or others.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;my office is looking for a new coffee machine to replace/upgrade from a keurig. I've been given three constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be plumbed so we don't need to keep filling the water reservoir.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It grinds beans as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be found new between 3-500 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My search yesterday only lead to finding machines that fulfilled 2 out of 3 constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I had a friend requesting exactly this for his gym recently and we were unable to find a machine that fit all three constraints. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The options were basically choose a commercial level plumbed machine with a separate grinder, or a home level grinder / brewer combo and pour water in yourself.  I think there may be some basic technological problems with sticking a grinder right on top of a brewer, since it would probably be subjected to less than ideal environmental conditions (all that water vapor getting on your burrs / into the bulk beans can't be good)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is a low volume situation, the Cuisinart DGB 900BC might work, if high volume I would recommend a plumbed Bunn / Curtis Airpot system.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the Foam Knife 1 Steam Tip you linked looks to also possess a female thread which means that it cannot be fitted on to the Breville Dual Boiler without modifying the steam arm in some way or replacing the steam arm for another compatible one that has male threading.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does ground coffee lose caffeine like it loses aroma?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What I know is that, for the best taste, one should grind the coffee right before brewing it. Storing ground coffee makes it lose part of its taste, even if there are ways to counteract that effect. However, assume I ground up some coffee and left it in an open conatiner for several weeks. Would the coffee lose any &lt;strong&gt;caffeine&lt;/strong&gt;, i.e. would I feel the effects of the coffee less than if I had brewed it directly after grinding?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If yes, what mechanisms are responsible for this and how does the caffeine leave the coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Caffeine has a very very low vapor pressure 9.0X10-7 mm Hg at 25 deg C.  &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/caffeine#section=Melting-Point" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost none would evaporate.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Optimal moka pot size for flavor extraction?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My hunch is the smaller the moka pot, the higher the pressure buildup, resulting in higher extraction.  Is this true and are there any other variables that may negate this theory?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I would assume that size doesn't matter - if the amount of water is proportionally the same then the steam pressure should also be the same, regardless of the size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it seems to be much more complicated than that, and part of your answer probably lies in the research paper entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com.virtual.anu.edu.au/science/article/pii/S1359431108002299" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Experimental investigation of steam pressure coffee extraction in a stove-top coffee maker&lt;/a&gt;" published in volume 29 of &lt;em&gt;Applied Thermal Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, which states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Despite its well-established usage, the moka has never been the
  subject of detailed analysis, which led to a series of unclear
  descriptions or misinterpretations concerning its functioning...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is if you can understand the thermodynamics, though the study itself seems to be a bit inconclusive. One of the closing statements is interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The quantity of dry air can influence both temperature and flow rate,
  thus affecting final extract quality, and it is meant to be the
  subject of further studies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, though, even the researchers decided that the moka is a bit of an enigma ("...a popular, yet mysterious, device, which so much diverges from other coffee-brewing methods"), so I don't know that you'll find any better answers outside of your own stove-top trials...&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Amount of coffee in French press vs. K-Cups</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Last night I was at a restaurant with friends and we were discussing coffee. So I shared that I typically use a French press with around 25g for a "real" cup (~400 mL). Everyone was suprised at how much coffee that is. Yet pretty much every website I've seen about French press recommends something around these lines, or more. Also - and more importantly - I've tried lowering the amount and it does taste thin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YET... I do enjoy for instance K-cup coffee, which is around 10g/cup. Does it mean the French press is not economical at all? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Consider trying an AeroPress coffee maker. It's kind of a redesigned French Press. It's quick, makes smooth coffee, and is easy to clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you put in one heaping (rounded) scoop of coffee, that's 14 grams or 3 tablespoons, according to &lt;a href="https://aerobie.com/aeropress/faqs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;their FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you're on the FAQ page, it answers interesting questions like about gentler coffee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... about one-fifth the acidity of drip brewed coffee and one-ninth the acidity of French press brewed coffee. Because of this it’s easier on your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a web page &lt;a href="http://aerobie.com/aeropress/aeropress-vs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;comparing AeroPress&lt;/a&gt; with French Press and other kinds of coffee makers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French presses use coarsely ground coffee because of the size of the holes in their filters. The coarsely ground coffee particles have less surface area than finely ground coffee. The lower surface area necessitates a long steeping time to extract full coffee flavor. Unfortunately, this results in bitterness and acidity in the cup. The AeroPress uses espresso or fine-drip grind coffee with a big surface area to quickly extract rich, full flavor without bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coarsely ground coffee required by French press filters unfortunately includes some small particles which pass through the filter and into your cup. These particles continue to leach bitterness leading to a harsh, gritty brew. AeroPress brewed coffee is micro filtered so it is pure and particle free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French presses cannot produce espresso style coffee and therefore the drinks that can be made with it. The AeroPress can produce regular American style coffee or an espresso style concentrate which can be used like espresso in espresso based drinks such as lattes and cappuccinos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All ground coffee contains the molecules cafestol and kahweol, two molecules which raise LDL (“bad”) cholesterol. The metal filters in French presses do not filter out cafestol and kahweol. The AeroPress’s paper filters do remove them, meaning that AeroPress brewed coffee is free of these harmful elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French presses are notoriously difficult to clean. The AeroPress is essentially self cleaning, requiring only a quick rinse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, if you use a Baratza grinder, see &lt;a href="http://www.baratza.com/grinding-tips/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for their recommended grind sizes. (The page also has a link to different brewing recipes, but to be honest, I'm happy with the standard recipe.)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Options for measuring TDS - Suggested refractometers</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for some options for measuring TDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything seems to point back to the VST Refractometer, but at $700+ I'd like to try some other options first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I founds a low cost TDS meter on Amazon, but it has proven to be highly inconsistent. Measuring the same brew multiple times provides multiple results that can vary greatly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts on other options for TDS meters, or will it make the most sense to just pony up for the VST?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You're on the right track with using a refractometer to measure coffee, but most people don't need a unit that expensive. There are more affordable refractometers if you don't need the VST CoffeeTools software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is the &lt;a href="http://www.atago.net/USA/products_pal.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Atago PAL-1"&gt;Atago PAL-1&lt;/a&gt;, which costs around $300. This is a digital refractometer. If you want something more affordable, you can get a manual brix refractometer which will start around $20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many brands of digital refractometers other than Atago, a quick Google search came up with some around $100-200, so there should be something in your price range and quality that will work for you. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What can I do to improve this cold-brew method?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The cold-brewed coffee we made was weak and tasteless. I spent an hour with the roaster to get the grind right but here are the steps and process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purchased coffee, and requested that they be ground to "drip grind" coarseness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 to 1 by volume (measuring cup) room temperature water to coffee grounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stirred in the jar then refrigerated for 24 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poured it manually through a paper filter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Result: as I was pouring the coffee through the water filter, I could tell that the coffee looked kind of translucent. The taste was weak and bland. There was no complexity, and while it was not bitter, it was very bland. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is the paradox that perplexes me.  I'm pretty sure that the grind is still too fine, but then on the other hand the coffee seems to be in on the weak side.  The brew process is somewhat simple, but "immersion" is a standard acceptable cold brew process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think we did wrong? Let's assume that the beans were of decent quality.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The problem is probably temperature of the water when steeping. For a better, more full-bodied result, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;steep at room temperature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Seattle Coffee Gear, for example, did a &lt;a href="https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/blog/2015/05/20/cold-brew-temperature-test/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;test of cold-brewing in the refrigerator and at room temperature&lt;/a&gt;, and reported that the room-temperature-steeped cold-brew was tastier, stronger, and more full-bodied. See also &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2326/is-there-a-difference-between-cold-brewing-in-the-fridge-vs-room-temp"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, don't refrigerate it until it's done brewing. Your fridge slows the extraction process down.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Differences in Espresso Machines Steam Wands</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Why do some home espresso machines have a steam wand with a sleeve over it and a tiny hole in the side of the sleeve?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does a home espresso machine (even a 15 bar pressure one) often not produce the same silky micro frothing milk as a professional machine?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I was going to put this in a comment because I believe I am relying on conjecture a bit too much but I ran out of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything I have read online indicates the air holes are various ways to idiot-proof the steam wand and make it more consumer friendly.  On my old Delonghi EC 155, it had 2 air holes that were used to help incorporate air into the milk.  A common modification of this machine was to replace the entire steamwand with a wand from a higher end machine that lacked all the air holes / plastic contraptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big hindrance to microfoam is the air holes mentioned, or simply, a poorly designed wand tip.  There are videos online of people producing high quality micro foam on the Delonghi EC 155 with a modified wand.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does my Moka pot sometimes produce GREAT coffee and sometimes awful coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So I try to grind about the same each time but for some reason if I don't hit the jackpot on adjusting my hand grinder I get sour or bitter coffee. Why is my Moka Express so finicky?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Actually, this question is self explanatory. I assume you only need some guidance and confirmation for what's going wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better known fact is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if your coffee is &lt;strong&gt;underextracted&lt;/strong&gt;, it tastes &lt;strong&gt;sour&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if your coffee is &lt;strong&gt;overextracted&lt;/strong&gt;, it tastes &lt;strong&gt;bitter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's tie up this to grind size:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if your grounds are &lt;strong&gt;finer&lt;/strong&gt;, your coffee &lt;strong&gt;overextracts&lt;/strong&gt; if other conditions are kept stable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if your grounds are &lt;strong&gt;coarser&lt;/strong&gt;, your coffee &lt;strong&gt;underextracts&lt;/strong&gt; if other conditions are kept stable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's known that Moka pots are not controllable devices. So, all the other conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.) are nearly same each time. Thus, it's obvious that your grinding directly affects the taste of your cup. You should be consistent about your grounds. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a final note, one of the jewels of this site is &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/481/whats-the-recommended-coffee-to-water-ratio-for-cold-brew/3440#3440"&gt;this extraction chart&lt;/a&gt; that you may check.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Wet grind with cold water to maximize yield?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I usually make drip coffee with a coffee maker, and the grinds go in pretty dry. I use 4 cups of water, but I usually only get around 2.5 cups of actual coffee out of it. I think that those 1.5 cups of water are partially evaporated, and partially absorbed by the grind. I have a theory that if I wet the grinds with cold water, they would saturate the grind but not absorb the flavor, and I could increase my coffee yields without diluting it. Is this a valid idea, or would I just end of creating diluted coffee? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Given that I commonly cold brew overnight, I find the idea that cold water would not absorb the flavor somewhat far-fetched. I also find your absorbtion crazy-high unless you are using a huge mount of ground coffee to yield 2.5 cups liquid. I've been french-pressing for months now, but I doubt I lost a cup in making 12 cups (about 8 measuring cups) when I was using my drip machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; do is to alter (favorably or unfavorably, only you can say, after you try it) the effective temperature of the extraction by supplying some cold water as well as the hot water (and if you are boiling off any significant amount of the 4 cups you start with, it's almost certainly too hot.)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does commercially brewed coffee taste so much better?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to figure out why coffee brewed with commercial machines taste so damn good compared to what I do at home. Whenever I'm out and about I always take note of the machines that are used in the brewing and some examples are WMF 1500S, Thermoplan Black &amp;amp; White and Franke A1000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm talking solely about black brewed coffee - no espressos or lattes. Whereas the coffee I get from these machines is aromatic and just the right amount of strong, the coffee I do at home is usually way too acidic and with a very long and overbearing aftertaste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I've certainly tasted bad coffee from these high-end machines it is never as bad as the coffee I do at home. I've tried researching how these machines work with the brew head and all but as I'm not an engineer I found that sorta stuff hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I've tried so far:
- 6-7 grams of coffee per 100 ml water
- Waiting 15-60 seconds after boil to allow water to cool down before pouring
- Different types of beans, usually pretty expensive (locally roasted, organic, non-organic, dark, medium, light, etc)
- Different ground levels for pour over
- Different brewing times (1 - 4 min)
- Probably a bunch of other stuff&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kit is:
- Full Hario V60 pour over kit (w/ dripper, server, filters and kettle)
- Melitta pour over dripper
- Kitchen scale
- Wilfa electric grinder (cleaned regularly)
- Bodum french press
- Good water source&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that people seem to think that pour-over is better and more gourmet but I've found the case to be the opposite. I'm almost to the point where I'm thinking of buying an expensive fully automatic bean-to-cup machine...
What do I do here guys? I'm very thankful for any insight into this matter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - title&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think there could be a few extra factors, besides grind type effecting your final cup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you trying to match the taste you get from an auto drip brewer by making your coffee with a v-60?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brewing method will change the taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's good to see you are using a scale too. When I make coffee &lt;a href="https://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/83" rel="noreferrer"&gt;I like to follow this chart for ratio.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use 21 grams of coffee to 12 ounces of water. It's important to note whenever the word "cup" is mentioned usually that means 6 ounces of water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I wonder about is the beans that the coffee house is using. You might be purchasing beans that are not giving you the flavor you are looking for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I like single origin coffee for pour overs and drip machines more than I like blended coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might find &lt;a href="https://bettercoffeeathome.com/specialty-coffee/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; helpful for selecting the right kind of beans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee cherry tea (aka Cascara or Sultana in Bolivia):&lt;/strong&gt; This is the tea made from the dried coffee cherries. Its color is pale red when brewed. It tastes like raisins or raspberries.&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>"Speed Roasting" from Coffee Tonya: Is it just as good?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;If any of you are familiar with the local coffee chain in Yokohama Japan, called Coffee Tonya, they have this speed roaster that roasts the beans you choose from their great selection of beans from around the world. I'd never seen one before, and I'm not familiar with the machine, so I'm not sure if the design and make is proprietary. But the roaster can roast the green beans to your desired roast in nearly 2 minutes flat &amp;amp; that is quite impressive, since you can choose from a light to dark roast gradient. I've purchased beans from a branch in the Philippines, had about 250g of Brazilian beans city-roasted (on the dark side), and must say that the result delivered a balanced flavor, without too much bitterness in the brew, creating a good bloom (pour over) &amp;amp;/or crema (Bialetti Brikka), and a pretty good expression from the roasted bean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to ask if anyone is familiar with the process of this quick-roasting style, and if there are any inherent differences that could come from this speed-roasted bean, as compared to a more traditional slow-roasted bean.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Roast times can significantly affect coffee flavors, and a 2 minute roast profile is concerning.  While I cannot say I am familiar with the process they are using, I do know a decent amount about the chemistry involved when you are roasting a coffee bean.  My biggest concern would be internal development of the coffee bean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you a brief run-down of roasting, without spending hours on this post..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You typically have two types of heat in roasting, conductive and convective.  There are disagreements on how best to apply heat to a coffee bean, but the traditional understanding is you apply conductive heat early in the roast and convective at the end.  The reason is because if you do not dehydrate the internal bean, you will get an insulating barrier of zero moisture encapsulating the moist interior of the bean that will result in underdeveloped flavors (sour, acidic)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you apply too much convective heat early on, then this will typically happen.  If you apply too much conductive heat, you usually get what is called tipping which can be seen on the ends of beans as a small black spot where the plant would actually sprout had the bean been planted (this is a natural weak spot in the cellular structure that allows the plant to sprout).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To roast a coffee bean from room temp to ~400F give or take 25 degrees in 2 minutes would require an average rate of rise (RoR) of 115 degree / minute.  To give you an idea of the difference, The highest RoR I typically roast at is about 36 RoR and maybe an average RoR of 15 or 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial reaction to application of heat so quickly to a coffee bean would be that you would get over-roasted on the outside with possible tipping, and an under roasted interior resulting in sourness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that timing on airbed roasters is different from traditional drum roasters, but I've never heard of them doing 2 minute roasts either so I am guessing this is a proprietary roasting system of some sort.  That being said, if you want a pretty in depth discussion on how roast times affect flavor you can check out Modulating the Flavor Profile of Coffee by Rob Hoos.  He gives a very thorough break down of what happens when you trim as little as 20 seconds off a given segment of a roast profile and how that affects the flavors in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(btw, if I deviate from my desired roast level by more than 45 seconds, the beans usually end up in the trash can because I refuse to sell them)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Any heath benefits of having butter coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Since the time I knew about unsalted butter coffee, I included it in my life. Every morning, I make a black coffee and put butter into it. I generated a taste for it and now it is perfect cup for me. Is there any real health benefits of it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Heath benefits of adding butter in your coffee are:
1) Vitamin K is found in butter,which helps in blood clotting and keeping the bones strong into old age.
2) Contains Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) which helps in weight loss.Not only burning belly fat,also protects against cancer and encourages muscle growth.
3) Adding butter in your coffee can provide more sustained energy.
4) Found Omega 3 fatty acids, play a role in the prevention and treatment of arthritis, inflammation,and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I keep several pots of coffee warm?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am the coffee guy for my parish's Fall Festival and every year I hit the same snag when it comes time to serve the coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the scenario:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am given:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 silver pots with vacuum sealed lids one has to press to open&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 gold pots with flip-top lids that don't really seal at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one large percolator (100 cups)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one medium percolator (about 65 cups)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one smaller percolator (about 35 cups)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are about 20 tables and people expect a pot of decaf and a pot of regular on each table.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tables seat 8-10 people, but sometimes only 2-4 people will sit down at a table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will have several servers with nothing better to do than check if coffee pots are full. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I keep the maximum amount of coffee warm in this scenario?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Actually, this answer will eventually boil down to the forecasting of time dependent expected coffee consumption function of your guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may expect that, right after a meal or right after they are seated people tend to drink coffee all together at once. Therefore, it is better to keep most (all?) of the pots filled up when you encounter them at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the servers may check the pots and replace the most crowded tables' pots with empty tables' pots for a while. During that time, you may prepare your second tank of coffee brew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the coffee fresh, you may preheat the water, I assume. I'm not sure if your percolators are compatible but you may just heat up the water in the big one. Then use the smaller ones to brew smaller batches of coffee to keep rather fresher and smaller batches of coffee. Also, if some of the coffee remains, it is clear that a smaller batch will cost you less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, for serving decaf, my approach would be something like that: I would keep a few of the servers busy with serving decaf around the less crowded tables and only leave decaf pots in the most crowded tables. (Assuming that decaf will be consumed less.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All and all, all of the above is my humble opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What bean-to-cup machines are available with dual hopper system to allow regular and decaf at the same machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm looking to buy an automated coffee machine for our small office setting; maybe 10 cups a day as a perk for our employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I feel we need is the ability to make decaf and caffeinated with the same machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the cheapest machine I've found that has a dual hopper setup:
&lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00AKY0BCS" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Jura Giga 5 Automatic Coffee Machine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there cheaper ones out there?  At this price point it almost feels like two machines would be a better option.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Many single-hopper machines have a little flap, drawer or similar opening where you can add ground coffee for one serving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you add one type of beans in the machine’s hopper you can use the second slot for the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the second one takes ground coffee doesn’t mean that half of your coffee drinkers have to use pre-ground, a good grinder should cost way less than a second machine or a dual hopper one. Just decide which group gets to use which setup. While we instinctively might say that the group that drinks more gets the simplest “just push a button” solution, maybe one fraction actually likes the “ritual” of the separate grinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per request, I checked for examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the machine at my office: A BOSCH VeroCafe, you can see the opened chute.

  <title>What's a good small hand / electric grinder available on the market?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Just transitioned from a coffee shop to an office job, and got a bag of wonderful Counter Culture coffee beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New workplace only buys pre-ground coffee and runs it through a Mr. Coffee drip machine. Boo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to buy an Aeropress and start grinding my own coffee beans. I think the fresh coffee will win people over and we can start getting some serious coffee action going on in the office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any recommendations for grinders? Looking in the $20-$30 range, but open to anything. Ideally it is small, something I can throw in my backpack on the way to the office, and easy-ish to clean. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I was nearly sure that I have already read the answer somewhere here. I couldn't find it. There might be a duplicate somewhere, or distributed among several answers. Anyway...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand grinders&lt;/strong&gt; could be the first option. They're way cheaper, smaller in size, easier to carry, and not noisy in action (nice property for office space). I could mention three nice grinders that I know of. Probably more people may want to add many more nice grinders, but these are the first three I could name. So, no offense please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hario has a nice small one. Skerton ceramic must be the model, I assume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zassenhaus has a very nice hand grinder. I opt for this as it can grind as fine as Turkish. Zassenhaus Havanna is the model name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Sözen is a very very nice hand grinder that you can use for centuries. They have just two models for decades; a carry-on and a table model with the same inner structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you can think of &lt;strong&gt;electric grinders&lt;/strong&gt;. Lately, I have heard of Baratza Encore a bit too much on the low end side. You may have a look at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure, there are specialized web sites just for choosing grinders such as &lt;a href="http://knowyourgrinder.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Will I get dehydrated from drinking coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In fact, 54 percent of Americans over the age of 18 drink an average of 3.1 (8 oz) cups per day; the equivalent to 40 billion dollars spent solely on the ever-so-popular cup o' Joe. With over half of the American adult population sharing the same admiration for good ol' java, what's happening inside our bodies if we're drinking it every single day?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Edit: I realized there have been a very similar answer on Coffee SE, already. Excuse me for my lack of attention. I add this link before my answer to complete the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/149/does-coffee-cause-dehydration/169#169"&gt;Does coffee cause dehydration?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's happening inside our bodies, is quite a question. I cannot answer that. However, I can answer the entitled question; &lt;em&gt;no, you shouldn't be dehydrated by consuming coffee&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous studies made on this issue. Some of them including sports area some others are generic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Paluska states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is the most commonly consumed drug in the world, and athletes frequently use it as an ergogenic aid. It improves performance and endurance during prolonged, exhaustive exercise. To a lesser degree it also enhances short-term, high-intensity athletic performance. Caffeine improves concentration, reduces fatigue, and enhances alertness. Habitual intake does not diminish caffeine's ergogenic properties. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the physiologic effects of caffeine, but adenosine receptor antagonism most likely accounts for the primary mode of action. It is relatively safe and has no known negative performance effects, nor does it cause significant dehydration or electrolyte imbalance during exercise. Routine caffeine consumption may cause tolerance or dependence, and abrupt discontinuation produces irritability, mood shifts, headache, drowsiness, or fatigue. Major sport governing bodies ban excessive use of caffeine, but current monitoring techniques are inadequate, and ethical dilemmas persist regarding caffeine intake by athletes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paluska, S. A. (2003). Caffeine and exercise. Curr Sports Med Rep, 2(4), 213-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang Zhang et al. states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, there was no evidence that caffeine ingestion in moderation would impair fluid balance during prolonged exercise in the heat or during 3 hours of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhang, Y., Carter, S. J., Schumacker, R. E., Neggers, Y. H., Curtner-Smith, M. D., Richardson, M. T., ... &amp;amp; Bishop, P. A. (2014). Effect of caffeine ingestion on fluid balance during exercise in the heat and during recovery. South African Journal of Sports Medicine, 26(2), 43-47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophie Killer et al. states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often suggested that coffee causes dehydration and its consumption should be avoided or significantly reduced to maintain fluid balance. The aim of this study was to directly compare the effects of coffee consumption against water ingestion across a range of validated hydration assessment techniques. In a counterbalanced cross-over design, 50 male coffee drinkers (habitually consuming 3–6 cups per day) participated in two trials, each lasting three consecutive days. In addition to controlled physical activity, food and fluid intake, participants consumed either 4×200 mL of coffee containing 4 mg/kg caffeine (C) or water (W). Total body water (TBW) was calculated pre- and post-trial via ingestion of Deuterium Oxide. Urinary and haematological hydration markers were recorded daily in addition to nude body mass measurement (BM). Plasma was analysed for caffeine to confirm compliance. There were no significant changes in TBW from beginning to end of either trial and no differences between trials (51.5±1.4 vs. 51.4±1.3 kg, for C and W, respectively). No differences were observed between trials across any haematological markers or in 24 h urine volume (2409±660 vs. 2428±669 mL, for C and W, respectively), USG, osmolality or creatinine. Mean urinary Na+ excretion was higher in C than W (p?=?0.02). No significant differences in BM were found between conditions, although a small progressive daily fall was observed within both trials (0.4±0.5 kg; p&amp;lt;0.05). Our data show that there were no significant differences across a wide range of haematological and urinary markers of hydration status between trials. These data suggest that coffee, when consumed in moderation by caffeine habituated males provides similar hydrating qualities to water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Killer, S. C., Blannin, A. K., &amp;amp; Jeukendrup, A. E. (2014). No evidence of dehydration with moderate daily coffee intake: a counterbalanced cross-over study in a free-living population. PloS one, 9(1), e84154.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Seal, et al. states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data indicate that caffeine intake of 6 mg kg?1 in the form of coffee can induce an acute diuretic effect, while 3 mg kg?1 do not disturb fluid balance in healthy casual coffee drinking adults at rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seal, A. D., Bardis, C. N., Gavrieli, A., Grigorakis, P., Adams, J. D., Arnaoutis, G., ... &amp;amp; Kavouras, S. A. (2017). coffee with high but not low caffeine content augments Fluid and electrolyte excretion at rest. Frontiers in Nutrition, 4, 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting result here may be the last one as it suggests that you should avoid drinking &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. 6 mg caffeine per kg may cause dehydration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, from &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/94/how-much-caffeine-is-in-an-espresso-shot"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; previous discussion we roughly know how much caffeine are there in a cup of coffee; around 160. This means, as a typical 80 kg male, if you don't consume 4 cups of coffee one after another, it should not be a problem. In a few hours, some of the caffeine should be metabolize so you can drink some more. But I don't know the pharmakinetics of caffeine. Maybe a pharmacologist may answer better. In which intervals should we drink the maximum amount of coffee and not to dehydrate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Won't leaving coffee grinds out overnight cause the coffee brewed the next day to be bland in the morning? This being said is there any way to have the coffee in there without it becoming bland overnight?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Define bland...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you compare just-ground to ground last evening and left open, yes, as a connoisseur you will probably notice a difference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing store-bought pre-ground coffee, a few hours in the open won’t matter too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, there are a few minor issues that may outweigh the “freshness” question: Morning breath? Being half-awake? Before the caffeine kicks in, I, for example, am in a somewhat zombie-mode. If it smells like coffee, I will probably drink it... Leaving the finer brews for a time when I can appreciate them.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to make mild instant coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've recently become a fan of "Nescafe Food Service bend" Instant coffee (as pictured below). I've had a number of other brands of instant coffee and have been wondering how do they create such a mild blend of instant coffee.  It clearly isn't freeze dried but is agglomerated, this usually gives the coffee more of a bitter taste, but here it is rather smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hDx84.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hDx84.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you make mild agglomerated coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Making instant coffee is the same process as making a cup of coffee from grinding your own beans - at least the first part of it before the drying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/411/how-is-instant-coffee-made"&gt;How is instant coffee made&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if I want a mild cup of coffee, I use less coffee grind. There are other variables that can be played with along with the amount of grind: extraction time, extraction temperature, bean roast level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can probably make your cup of instant less mild by adding an extra spoon or so of instant. Simulating (?) more coffee grind.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Indians understanding coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this question is not about brewing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am from India. Every time I go to a coffee shop and order an espresso or &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.in/search?q=Americano" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Americano&lt;/a&gt;, knowing fully well what they are, I get a prompt ‘there’s no milk or sugar in it’ from the barista. What’s the story behind this? Have Indians ordered the said coffees because they cheapest one on the menu and then complained / threw away?
I have observed this on the two opposite ends of the country and across brands including airport and railway station coffees!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I am South Indian and a coffee fanatic; and each time I order an espresso, the coffee shop staff member will be sure to say, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;there is no milk in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don't say 'no sugar' in my town because it's probably assumed that we will add sugar separately anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happened again recently in a new coffee shop in the neighborhood, so I asked the employee why they always say like this -- and he had some free time and was kind enough to explain why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not every client knows what is an espresso or Americano. They may order it as a fresh experiment. Now, the famous &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_filter_coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;South Indian Filter Coffee&lt;/a&gt;  and even a generic cup of coffee that you order in your typical Indian tea/coffee shop or download from the coffee machine in a hospital or railway station &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; has milk and sugar in it. So customers might expect it here and get a bad surprise for a high price: it has actually happened in the early days of our old shop and we were scolded for not warning them it is a black coffee! It's to avoid such confusion we routinely tell clients that the espresso/ Americano contains no milk, and that sugar will be served separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I have seen this more often in smaller cafés. For example, in outlets of a major coffee company like &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Coffee_Day" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Café Coffee Day&lt;/a&gt;,  employees in this city will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; usually tell a customer that their espresso/ Americano doesn't have milk or sugar (unless you specifically ask for a description), because it's generally assumed that if you order an espresso or an Americano in a specialist place like Café Coffee Day, you definitely know what you are asking for!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How could I fix espresso that pours too fast?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The books and info I've read mention extracting for 25 seconds, but I get waaaaay more than a double shot of espresso in that duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact numbers I have are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15.6g of ground coffee (after taring the portafilter and filter inside)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;22 seconds made 78.9g of coffee (after taring espresso cup)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using a Breville espresso machine... like the most common household one (cost me $100 to $150 I think, like 4 years ago).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grinder is a Bodum, also cost me about $100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ground on the espresso symbol, the finest my grinder well do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grind directly into the portafilter and I used a nice stainless steel tamper to tamp what was probably between 20lbs and 40lbs, just a little more than gravity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not discussing taste here, but some potential other causes: I once put my portafilter and filters in the dishwasher, and that peeled the stainless steel off the portafilter, but it continues to work, so I figured it was fine. Also I've never decalcified my machine, although I did take it apart and clean it about a year and a half ago. Oh and the beans were some third-wave hipster brand, it costs $18 for a pound bag.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;First things first; I advise you to decalcify your device in advance. This may fix many shady problems and taste issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be several issues that may affect your flow. These are what I can say at first sight...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grind size: Finer and more consistent grinds may help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even distribution in the basket: if you don't evenly distribute the grounds, some water may leak around the grounds instead of brewing your coffee. Take care of even distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tamping: Tamp evenly, consistently and a bit more forcefully when necessary. Some baristas tamp up to 20 kg-f during tamping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a final note; for the given amount of grounds, a doppio (double espresso) is quite normal. Doppio should be 60 ml in your cup. In general, 14 - 16 gr of coffee grounds make a 60 ml doppio.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I know when to end the bloom?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I’m familiar with &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/337/37"&gt;what the bloom is&lt;/a&gt; and why we do it. But all of the instructions and guides about pour-over coffee I’ve ever seen recommend a specific &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; to let the coffee bloom before continuing with the brew. 40-45 seconds seems to be the most common consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have to assume that every coffee setup is going to be a little bit different. Small changes in the freshness of the beans, the size and shape of the grind, the temperature of the water, maybe even things like the mineral content of the water? - all of these factors and more are going to have at least some effect on how much CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the coffee wants to offgas and how long it takes. So, “45 seconds” seems like a good guideline or rule of thumb, but I would imagine that some brews need less time and some need more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if I want to gauge my bloom time by my senses instead of by the clock, what should I look for? I have noticed that toward the end of the bloom, the coffee starts to make a faint crackling noise. As the bloom “falls”, it becomes flat, and then cracks begin to appear into the surface, and eventually it falls past flat and becomes a little bit concave. (When it’s flat and starting to crack it looks to me a little bit like a chocolate cookie. It makes me hungry in the morning.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what I’ve noticed so far about the “phases” of the bloom. At which point in the process is it best to begin the rest of the pour?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The bloom should be 30s for V60 and 40-45s for Chemex and Kalita and 30s for full immersion methods (like AeroPress or French Press). Blooming is not just about degassing but also to saturate the grounds (which obviously goes hand in hand) and to start dissolving solid compounds (mainly acids and caffeine, sugars come later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd want to change, just to see what happens (I doubt you will make better coffee with blooming times that diverge a lot from those "standards", since they have been proven to be optimal for the respective brewing devices used), then you could consider shortening the blooming time when the coffee is a few weeks old and has oxidized and degassed quite a bit. You notice when it stops bubbling, that would be a definite visual clue. If the same coffee that's been degassing until 30s (for V60), suddenly stops bubbling at 20s, you can try to reduce blooming time a bit. You'll run into trouble though, because your overall extraction time will likely be shorter until you figured out new grinder settings. The phases you describe really depend on the freshness of the coffee and the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; it contains (darker roast would contain more e.g. because it's more porous). The slurry of very fresh coffee is still bubbly and has foam on top after 30s, not noticeably decreasing in volume, while a not so fresh coffee might fall flat after 15s already. I don't know what exactly you mean with cracks, I'll pay attention next time. More like holes where the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exits, but I do agree it looks a little bit like chocolate cookies, when the coffee bed fell flat and the gas has mostly evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can stir with a wooden spatula/spoon/chop stick to make sure you saturate all the grounds, but in my opinion that is not necessary and I've noticed that too much agitation somehow screws up the brewing, often over extracting. Which makes sense, more agitation, faster extraction. If you pour it nicely in concentric circles agitating the grounds slightly, you can manage to saturate all grounds without stirring and without agitating too much. That's ideal in my opinion, but the opinions on this point split widely.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Corrosion in espresso filter holder</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have thoroughly cleaned my espresso coffee machine, and found signs of corrosion under the layer of tar inside the filter holder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should I do? Leave it? Scrape it off? Get a replacement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is  there a way to prevent this in the future? I suppose getting less sour coffee would help, but unfortunately that's not the kind I like.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Although I have not a real answer as for is hard to tell without specifically knowing the metal/metal treatment/alloy, posting to Chemistry SE might help. To me it looks like a plated Aluminum that got oxidized where the protection dropped.

  <title>What Type of Coffee Pot is Shown in Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire"?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was recently watching the original music video for Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire," and at &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/eFTLKWw542g?t=38s" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;0:38&lt;/a&gt; there's a shot of a stovetop with an odd looking device with what I assume is a coffee pot on top. There are two bowls, one on top of the other, with some tubes in between them. There appears to be coffee, or some other dark beverage, in the bottom of the two bowls. It doesn't appear to be on an actual range, but rather sitting on a hot pad, after the brewing process is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a screenshot of the scene:
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DTw6t.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DTw6t.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What type of coffee pot is this, and how is it supposed to work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_coffee_maker" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;vacuum coffee maker or siphon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invention is nearly 200 years old and uses the physical principles of vapor pressure and vacuum. When placed on a heat source, boiling water creates steam and thus pressure in the bottom compartment. Hot water from the lower pot is pushed through a (glass) tube into the upper part, where it meets the ground coffee. After the required brewing time, the pot is removed from the stove and the resulting partial vacuum and the atmospheric pressure push the coffee back into the lower vessel. The grounds are held back by a filter mechanism (various types used).&lt;br&gt;
Here’s a &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=k39PglKr8dQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, that shows the Bodum type in action, without distracting talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related type of coffee maker is Bialetti’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;moka pot&lt;/a&gt;, which pushes the water through the grounds by the same principle, but collects it in the upper part - no flow-back mechanism in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>My Handpresso got leakage after leave it with some air pressure built in. Could it be worse?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Today, I got my Handpresso at work to have some coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I picked up and pressed valve, I heard air escaping sound. That means there was still some air pressure inside chamber! I used it last Friday, and I forgot to bring it home to clean. So, according to my memory, I've left it almost 2.5 days with air pressure built in chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I was little worried. And when I poured water into reservoir, water is leaking through valve. But strangely, I cannot hear any air leakage from valve or reservoir during brewing process. I've pumped it without water, and still looks like no air leakage from device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I reached this point, I'm really worrying that I've broke my Handpresso because of my mistake. Is this situation OK? If not, how can I check and fix water leakage?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Pressure may have built up as a consequence of the residual water and such inside the device and environmental temperature/pressure changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be okay, and it seems to still be working. Make sure you thoroughly clean it just because you left it for a couple of days. Other than checking for any visible deformities (especially around the silicone sealed areas), if its still working it and tastes fine it likely is not broken.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Delonghi Dedica rubber wand is propelled into milk pitcher</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I own a Delonghi Dedica EC685 and looking to get some proper microfoam for latte art, I removed the Panarello tube and tried to froth the milk using just the inner rubber tube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem right now is that it works for a few seconds and then the rubber tube detaches itself from the pipe and it's propelled into my milk pitcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did check the tube, it looks clean, nothing clogging it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any idea what can I do to prevent this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think the panarello is keeping the inner rubber tube in place, so it's normal for the tube to pop off under pressure. You can hold the tube in place by using a cable tie as can be seen in this video: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApDjtXaHa7U" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Frothing milk for latte art with the De'Longhi Dedica EC685&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/juNDa.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/juNDa.jpg" alt="cable tie"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that solution will make it difficult to remove the tube for cleaning. I suggest using a wire spring clip to hold the rubber tube into place, while still being easy to remove. For reference, I'm using a &lt;a href="https://www.advancedfluidsolutions.co.uk/mikalor-double-wire-spring-hose-clip-129---136mm-1637-p.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Mikalor Double Wire Spring Hose Clip 12.9-13.6mm&lt;/a&gt;. This is quite a tight fit and not so easy to place/remove, so you might want to use a slightly larger clip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNsgr.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNsgr.jpg" alt="wire spring clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful not to use a spring clip that is too small so as not to damage the plastic over which the tube is slid.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>If a recipe calls for instant coffee, can just regular ground coffee be substituted?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When instant coffee is called for in a baking recipe, can regular ground roasted coffee be used? Will the same amount work?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Unlikely that you will run into any problems, although chemically they won't behave the same way. Instant coffee completely dissolves while the ground coffee will be in there as solid pieces that soak up some water and add taste. I assume the total amount of coffee used is just too little to affect the composition of the dough very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could however also substitute some of the liquid in the recipe with brewed coffee. I think that's the way I would go with. That way you just have the desired taste without changing the composition and ratios of the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Brew a less acidic coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;A recent visit to the dentist opened my eyes to a new aspect of tooth care I hadn't realized: apparently, the acidity of coffee can increase the growth of cavities if the teeth are not brushed directly after.  Unfortunately, brushing the teeth directly after my morning coffee isn't really an option.  Also, unequivocally, giving up my morning coffee isn't an option either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That led me to wonder, is there any way of brewing a normal coffee in a way that would lead to a beverage with a higher pH, that still has the taste and caffeine of a normal coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You can try switching to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_brew_coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;cold brew coffee&lt;/a&gt; which is reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/coffees-dirty-little-secret" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;67% less acidic than regular brewed coffee&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the caffeine amount, Wikipedia notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although less caffeine is extracted with the cold brew method, a higher coffee-to-water ratio is often used, between 2 and 2 1/2 times. This may compensate for this difference in solubility, resulting in a brew with equal, if not more, caffeine (although this is unlikely)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, despite the name, &lt;em&gt;cold brew coffee can be enjoyed hot as well.&lt;/em&gt; Cold brew is essentially a coffee concentrate if steeped long enough. You can cut your cold brew with boiling water and serve it hot (&lt;a href="https://www.jamieoliver.com/news-and-features/features/how-to-make-cold-brew-coffee/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;), so you don't need to necessarily change the way you enjoy your coffee (if you enjoy it hot). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this is helpful!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Grinder reassembly: should I grease the gearbox?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Bodum Bistro grinder that I bought used a couple of months ago, and have been fairly impressed with.  It started making a horrible gear-grinding noise today, after getting a very small, very hard bean stuck in the burrs.  Being physiologically incapable of doing otherwise, I &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ohDg.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;tore it down&lt;/a&gt; to see what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was shocked to see that &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0znbO.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the (delrin? nylon?) gears&lt;/a&gt; actually aren't all chewed up at all.  They were just choked with dirty, messy, nasty, oily grinds, presumably keeping the motor shaft from engaging properly.  I ran the gearbox through the dishwasher to clean it all out, and I think there's hope that this thing will work again when I put it back together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I just had a horrible thought:  The gearbox isn't sealed.  Maybe the mess in the gearbox was a combination of grinds and grease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts please: should I be packing the gears with silicon grease before I put it all back together?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: What I did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used white lithium grease, after applying foil tape to seal openings between the coffee area and the gearbox area, figuring that there would be a very low likelihood of the grease aerosolizing and getting into the coffee area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reassembly was a bear, though.  I ended up hardwiring past the rocker switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.5 Years Later:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been 2.5 years, and I have not tasted the grease, and the grinder is still running strong.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes, I assume the gearbox was originally lubricated to function properly somehow. I cannot believe the gears just rotate by their own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And about the sealing. Such devices produced in bulk mostly do not care about proper sealing, no worries. Therefore, some parts may get in contact with your &lt;em&gt;food&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, about greasing... There are food-safe lubricants made out of vegetable oils for food machinery. These are generally aroma-free, so they won't affect the taste of your coffee. You can buy one of them and use. I don't link as you can easily search the net. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the difference between a Blend and Single Origin coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know the difference between blend and origin coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many of us continuously discuss origins on this site. I searched through the site, interestingly cannot find a short, precise definition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, &lt;strong&gt;variety&lt;/strong&gt; is confused with single origin. So,  I would like to start with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxonomically, Coffea genus has several species and we consume three of them as the &lt;em&gt;coffee&lt;/em&gt; drink. These three species have several &lt;strong&gt;varieties&lt;/strong&gt;. They may be thought as varieties of dog from a biological perspective. Same species, several properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For coffee though, the variety is not the only criteria that affects the quality of a bean. Cultivation, climate, soil, irrigation, harvesting, drying and peeling the fruit from the bean,  drying the bean are all affect the bean quality. So, if you have a specific &lt;em&gt;variety&lt;/em&gt; and also you can guarantee the region and the aforementioned process is stable for a batch of beans, you call them &lt;strong&gt;single origin&lt;/strong&gt; beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blends&lt;/strong&gt; are "blends" of several single origin coffee beans to produce the flavor characteristics of more than one single origin coffee. For a recent related post on blends please check this: &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Decaf coffee, how to make our own</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I saw this on a coffee site:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we all know, it is really hard to get a good decaf specialty
  coffee. The decaf process removes oils and flavors as well as the
  caffeine, leaving a blah cup behind. It's a little known trick that
  you can "decaf" your coffee using a french press. Pour just enough hot
  water to cover the grounds. Let sit briefly. Press the grounds and
  pour off the water. As caffeine is highly soluble in water, this first
  extraction should pull off most of it. Then add more water to the pot,
  and extract as usual. Voila! A ‘decaffeinated’ coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any validity to this?  Are you just tossing out good coffee or does this actually work?  Many thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In short: &lt;strong&gt;Very probably, you will lose the very best part of your coffee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is highly soluble, yes. But, also the other lipids and aromatics, too. So, you cannot obtain the benefits of &lt;em&gt;specialty coffee&lt;/em&gt; if you ruin that first brew. The main taste we gain from coffee grounds are received from the soluble aromatic oils in the coffee. You don't want to loose them by pouring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, decaffeination process is made when the beans are green. That's why the aromatics are kept inside the beans when the beans are over-hydrated and then dried (in the Swiss process, which is the common way recently) a few times in a cycle to near completely remove the caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check the decaffeination process in the following question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;What does wetting the coffee for 30 seconds do? What will happen if I pour in all the hot water and wait for 5 minutes rather than wetting it and waiting for 30 seconds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wet the coffee and wait for 30 seconds if you’re using fresh coffee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should I pour remaining water in batches anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Pour half of the remaining water over a 30-second duration
  Pour the rest of the water in three or four smaller increments&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Making coffee is all about extraction. The compounds you find in coffee beans that add flavor dissolve at different moments of the process. Some dissolve almost instantly when the coffee grounds come in contact with water. Like for example caffein and the more acidic compounds. Others take a while before the water dissolves them, like bitter compounds and sugars. The goal is to have an even extraction. To get the best possible flavor out of the coffee. You want some sugars in there to give it sweetness, but you don't want too much bitterness. You want fruitiness and acidity, but you don't want it as sour as lemon juice. So you need to balance the extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different variables influencing this process, but they all come down to how fast and much extraction is happening. The grind size, the water temperature (and mineral content) and the brewing time just to name the most important ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wetting the grounds, or blooming, is preparing them for the extraction. When coffee is roasted CO2 gas is trapped inside the beans. Wetting the grounds, without water passing through the filter (for drip coffee where blooming is most important, certainly more than for full immersion techniques like French press) has the effect of the CO2 being released to ensure an even extraction when you are brewing. There are several straight forward reasons for that and some more technical ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blooming prevents channeling of the water (the phenomena that all the water will flow through small holes of grounds instead of saturating all of them)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't bloom the gas in the beans will bubble upwards pushing the water away from the grounds which results in channeling and uneven extraction of the particles that are trapped inside the gas bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine your grind, it's made up of particles of different sizes with most of them somewhere hovering around the size you actually wanted. So when you start pouring water without blooming the small particles will soak up the water faster than the bigger ones and will obviously start extracting earlier. In the end that will result in over extracted small particles and very under extracted bigger particles. By pre infusing the grounds you even that out a little bit. By adding just enough water to infuse all of the grounds without already extracting, you start from a more even level. The smaller particles will still extract more than the bigger ones, but the extraction levels are evened out, because the starting point is more leveled and extraction begins at the same moment for all grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Why should I pour remaining water in batches anyway?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more a matter of style. Some Baristi prefer it that way and others pour continuously. More important is that you don't brew excessively long or short. Between 2,5 min. and 3 min. is a good time (for Hario V60, different for other pour over methods). Some say that pouring in batches helps being consistent, but it's not something that's necessary. I brew very consistent (measurably with a refractometer that measures total dissolved solids or TDS) and I pour continuously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are the options of selecting grinds:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sD9nD.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sD9nD.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which one should be chosen?  &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The explained methodology is traditional Indian-style preparation method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, historically Indians realize that tea and coffee includes many active radicals at the early ages just by observation. (I'm skeptical that it is related to any chemical knowledge.) Then, they started to add milk to these two beverages to neutralize the radical components. That's why Indians have this kind of coffee as well as &lt;em&gt;Chai Latte&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method may seem similar to Turkish method in the beginning of decoction, but requires much more brewing time. Mostly ended up warm, if not cold, mixed with lots of milk and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can watch how this coffee is prepared in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_8zIJgPOOk" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;em&gt;which grind is best for this type of coffee?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this is kind of decoction, Turkish grind seems like the first option. But, brewing will take longer. So, &lt;strong&gt;I opt for Mokka grind&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit:&lt;/em&gt; I realized that, the list actually includes &lt;strong&gt;South Indian Filter&lt;/strong&gt; method. So, please choose that option. This option is normally very rare in the rest of the globe. That's probably why I missed that.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why do I need to warm a french press before using it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;It has been recommended in a number of youtube videos and blogs to warm the frenchpress glass before brewing coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does one need to do this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To keep the brewing temperature as stable as possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using glassware during brewing as in French-press, V60 or Chemex, it is important to warm up the gadgets prior to brewing. Normally, the water temperature is set just below boiling point (around 95 degrees Celsius) for a good brew. When you start with cold glassware, your nicely prepared close-to-boiling-point water may cool down a few degrees, which is crucial in the taste of the final cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional note:&lt;/em&gt; Moreover, after brewing, pouring the prepared coffee to a cold cup may decrease the temperature a few additional degrees, which renders your beverage at most warm, instead of hot.  This is mostly visible in espresso as its volume is relatively small. As a result, it is also recommended to keep the cups warmed. Some home espresso machines have additional heating trays on top to keep the cups warm before pulling an espresso shot.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee in bottom chamber of moka pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have recently purchased a new Bialetti moka pot and I've found that after brewing a cup of coffee and letting the pot cool down, there's coffee in the bottom chamber. Am I cutting off the heat too early? Or is this some kind of issue with the pot I'm using? Let me know what you think. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think you are on the right track with your idea. To understand what's happening you need to understand how the moka pot works and how to correctly use it. I'll explain it here quickly but there are some nice illustrations on how it works on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt; for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the heat should be cut off once you hear the first hissing sound. That is when all the water has been pushed through the ground coffee and the brew is ready. By construction there remains a little bit of water in the bottom chamber. That is because the spout of the filter basket doesn't go all the way to the bottom of the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the water starts boiling, the steam of the evaporated water pressurizes the chamber between 1,5 and max. 3 bar (that is the pressure the safety valve sustains without opening) depending on the grind size of your coffee, the amount of coffee and if you tamp it (which you should not). The gas pressurizes the area above the water, which pushes the water through the spout, through the ground coffee and into the top part until the water level is so low that the steam exits through the spout. That's the hissing sound. So one of two things could be happening here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There might still be a lot of water in the "brewing chamber", where the ground coffee is, when you cut off the heat. Then the pressure in the bottom chamber will fall and the coffee in the middle gets sucked down into the water chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty similar but instead of the ready brewed coffee it is some of the grounds that get sucked into the water chamber and keep brewing there in the rest of the water. It may be that it is ground too finely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these things are not a problem though, just flush everything with warm water and that's it (no detergent if it's an aluminium pot or you risk oxidation).  It only affects the coffee if you cut the heat way too early or too late.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I clean a rusted moka pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I got a moka pot about 1 year ago, I used only 2 times. After the first time I used it I cleaned it with soap and let it air dry. I noticed then some oxidation (rust) inside the pot, I tried to soak it in hot water and vinegar but it didn't work. So, is it safe to use it (although I smell the metal from the pot)? How can I get rid of the rust? And what is the best way to clean a moka pot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yd5tL.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yd5tL.jpg" alt="oxidized moka pot"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Based on your photo your pot appears to be made from aluminum based on the white corrosion.  This will make cleaning it a bit harder overall but no worries!  A great product that will take care of this issue for aluminum or stainless (many other materails as well) is Bar Keepers Friend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Keepers_Friend" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia's article on Bar Keeper's Friend&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unlike more abrasive cleaning powders such as Comet and Ajax, Bar Keepers Friend uses oxalic acid as its primary active ingredient. A similar abrasive cleaning product, Zud Heavy Duty Cleanser, also contains oxalic acid. Prolonged use and extended skin contact may cause irritation, peeling and contact dermatitis, which is avoided by wearing gloves. The product can also be an eye irritant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just used BKF to clean my stainless percolator pot and it did a great job it looks new!  I had baked on brown residue and it took it off in less then a minute.  Now my pot looks almost new.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your specific pot I would get a good scrub brush and some BKF and give it a few minutes scrub and it will look new again!  I think BKF may be one of the most underrated tools for us coffee junkies.  It gets everything so clean, it even has taken those impossible stains out of the bottom of some of my well used coffee cups.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent corrosion issues in the future the best course of action is to clean it and dry it completely after each use and not let coffee or water sit in it for prolonged time.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I design a Turkish coffee mixture?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to create a Turkish coffee mixture, by combining Colombian, Brazilian, Robusta and a few other types together in some percentage.
I could not find a base at which to stand in designing such mixture. What are the ideal characteristics of Turkish coffee ? How much caffeine, glucose, other chemicals should it contain ?  &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no recipe for preparing a perfect blend.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before beginning, please read this somewhat relevant question first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/4175/what-are-the-basics-of-creating-an-espresso-blend"&gt;What are the basics of creating an espresso blend?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, personally, prefer to use Ethiopian Harrar single origin beans, light-to-medium roasted. However, this may all depend. When you go to a commercial Turkish firm, they mostly consume Dos Santos beans from Brazil, which itself is a kind of blend itself, and roast them to charcoal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prepare a Turkish blend, all you need to know is the characteristics of the brewing technique (See this &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2384/triple-heating-of-the-turkish-coffee/2392#2392"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; for a discussion) as you can see in the previous post. Opposite to the espresso, Turkish brewing is the least acidity revealing technique out there as it uses decoction. Therefore,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can safely use acidic beans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you don't need to roast a lot to get rid of acidity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and, as a result, you can taste the fruitful notes, go for fruity beans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you may safely try dry/honey processed beans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, about the chemicals... You should not put any additional chemicals in it. It should be just ground coffee. I know some commercial products that already mix some herbs or sugar with fine ground coffee; but it has nothing to do with the reality apart from marketing. Think of it as 3-in-1 instant coffee products. You probably don't want to drink them.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Espresso Machine: How Old is Too Old?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I inherited a Krups Type 964 espresso machine from my parents. Actually, I found it under a pile of junk in their garage 5 to 6 years ago. It had been under that pile of junk for probably more than 10 years. I cleaned it off and ran white vinegar through it a few times and it has worked mostly fine ever since. It can't push water through coffee that is too finely ground and it has a leaking overflow spigot (which I fixed with some flexible tubing). I've never used the milk frother. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that it has consistently made 1 to 2 double shots of espresso for me everyday for the last 5 to 6 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am wondering is - at point should I just get a new espresso machine? Is there a chance this old one will violently rupture/explode due to use and age? Am I better off just investing in a new one?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The easiest would be to service the machine. Think of it as bringing your car to the shop or going to a physician / dentist yourself, so a professional can check some things that might be indicative of problems and do some basic maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can try to find a (video) guide for your specific model, try it yourself (with or without a guide) or have it done by some shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, you'll want to look for obvious problems like small leaks, rust and mould. Other things you might be able to do is replacing the gaskets that seal of different tubes. For that, you'd need to know which ones you need exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are the differences between americano and espresso?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Can anybody tell me the differences between an americano and an espresso because I am quite confused.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;espresso&lt;/em&gt; is a shot of coffee produced by forcing hot water at high pressure through coffee grounds. Often, the espresso is the base shot of coffee from which other coffee drinks are prepared, although it is also quite common to enjoy it on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;americano&lt;/em&gt; is a coffee drink made by pouring one espresso and then adding hot water on top of it. This hot water weakens the coffee a little and mitigates some bitter notes. It is also consequently a larger drink and retains its heat for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ivan mentions in the comments, you may also be interested in the &lt;em&gt;long black&lt;/em&gt;. It's a little like a reverse americano, where the espresso shot is pulled over hot water. This retains more of the crema than an americano does.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Advantage of Dual Scale Setups for Pour Over?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've seen a couple photos of pour over setups where one would have an "outer" scale that measures the input water pour while a secondary scale measures the output resultant drip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there some sort of reason one would like to take the extra step and use this setup?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only explanation I thought of would be that the person is highly concerned of the the amount to be poured to the final cup, being highly mindful of consistency... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See Acaia's stand for example with their smart scales:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HTgLE.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HTgLE.jpg" alt="Acaia&amp;#39;s Dual Scale Setup"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;My goodness - all sorts of new gadgets to get intrigued about - and now - you have a reason to buy BOTH sizes of acaia scales! a pearl for the base and a lunar for the pot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for me this double weighing is to check saturation of water by beans - seems like this device could make this process reuqire fewer steps.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance - i like to make sure i'm getting at least a 2-1 water absorption relative to weight of beans. if the taste is less rich than i'd like before adjusting the amount or grind, it's a quick check to see how much water was actually absorbed by the bean - sometimes this absorption check tells me something about the age of the beans too - if they haven't degassed long enough they seem to absorp less - and that's even if the coffee slury is well stirred/no bubble in the slury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also interesting in an abstract kind of way to see how absorption differs fro same grind, amount but different varieties. etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's this kind of check that let me let the coffee sit a little longer after stir before doing a pour: higher absorption seems to relate nicely to richer flavour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least that's what i'm finding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thanks for sharing this trick new device.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;What you have mentioning is widely known as iced-coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most widely adopted method is to brew any type of coffee: filter, drip or french-press. Then, adding ice cubes in a cup and pour the coffee to fill the cup. After that, you mix it to homogenize the temperature, add milk and sugar if desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another method is known as Japanese brew. In that method, you prepare an ice cube filled cup beforehand. Then, pull your shot of espresso on top of ice. (Optionally, filter/drip on top of ice.) This method is known to preserve aromas better than the previous.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the most effective way of consuming coffee (and caffeine in general)?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I generally drink 1–2 cups of coffee per day, between 09:00–12:00. I switch to teas after lunch so I'm not still full of caffeine by the time I go to bed. I wouldn't say that's heavy usage by any stretch, but I can tell that coffee doesn't effect me much any more (i.e. I can have a big mug late and night and then go to bed a couple of hours later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's about the extent of how much I've thought about my coffee consumption. However, I'm sure there must be some sort of optimal strategy for getting the most ‘bang for your buck’. No articles I've found seem able to agree on one though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-secret-to-using-coffee-effectively-2014-2?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; says to start with a 1-month coffee fast, and &lt;a href="https://vitals.lifehacker.com/when-you-should-or-shouldn-t-cycle-caffeine-1742908307" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; concurs, whilst this one &lt;a href="http://moneyminiblog.com/productivity/caffeine/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; says a week'll do. The first article then says to stick to one cup per week, with the occasional extra if really needed, which seems very low (since the effects only last around 6–8 hours). The second article doesn't give a target to aim for, but warns against daily coffees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://nationalpost.com/life/food/when-are-the-best-times-in-the-day-to-drink-coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/kenny-kline/how-to-boost-productivity-by-using-caffeine-like-a-biohacker.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; don't say anything negative about daily coffees, instead just saying to avoid certain times (e.g. 08:00–09:00).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/kenny-kline/how-to-boost-productivity-by-using-caffeine-like-a-biohacker.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/top-10-tricks-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-caffeine-hit-1754627885" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; both seem to advocate something along the lines of coffee microdosing, whilst the others don't really say anything on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With all this conflicting  advice, is it just an fundamentally inexact science or is there a canonical guide on how to maximise coffee effectiveness out there somewhere?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) how long should one initially abstain to reduce any built-up tolerance? 1 week or 1 month?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) afterwards, how often should coffee be drunk in order to maximise the benefits whilst minimising the build-up of tolerance? 1 cup a day, 1 cup a week, microdosing throughout the day or something else?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I suppose I would consider optimal caffeine (primarily through coffee)
  usage to any usage that maximizes fatigue
  reduction/alertness/wakefulness whilst minimizing tolerance build-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok Rumps, given that interest, let me offer a few notes-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptation: first off, our brains adapt to caffeine over time, so a dose that may give you effects now, may give you zero effects later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plan to back off from caffeine every month or so if your goal is this effect rather than just the pleasure of the beverage. Why? Some receptor clean up in the brain needs to happen and that takes time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine does not reduce fatigue - just to be clear - fatigue is a set of system level responses that tell you you are potentially under slept or under nourished  - using a drug to mask that doesn't sort that problem. What caffeine can do is?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine assists "alertness" by again blocking what the body is telling you about rest - So, it's a kind of chicken and egg thing in terms of how it works: Caffeine will block adenosine receptors in the brain especially later in the day (when this substance builds up in the brain to start a wind down cycle) - and that's for many people about the worst time to have a coffee - because of its half life it can really start to disrupt sleep - and make it harder to get to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine also seems to be associated with helping folks work out hard, and also perform better on cognitive tests - when used as a dose in an experiment right before a test. So that may say something about "strategic dosing" for an acute effect (effect right at time of need), and having to work hard physically can be boosted here by the connection to serotonin - and other cool stuff happening in muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yes caffeine is a long time supporter of fat burning too - so it seems to rev up fat burning - but so does green tea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as I'm skeptical about some of this - the weight of evidence suggests that moderate coffee drinking has no ill effects, and while some of the benefits may be attenuated as one adapts, it's not causing harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice overview from 2010 is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900710002510?via%3Dihub" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't checked into more current research on each of these topics, but one review suggests that coffee compounds, when sent to a Petri dish of cancer cells, arrests proliferation of the cells - this seems like an awesome thing.
&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6321559/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;See&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In working with athletes and university students - to get a performance boost, however - they cycled their dosing - really tapering off before a key event, and using it strategically in a period before the event to get the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as to your question about optimal dosing - you can test a few things for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find out what your optimal cut off time is for coffee not to disturb you getting to sleep. Earlier is probably better: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most work suggests 6-8 hours before hitting the sack for sleep is needed to have caffeine flushed out of the system. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, coffee ups stomach acids - not a good idea before going to sleep 
and finally - If you don't need to push yourself awake don't do it. Figure out ways to get more rest - a challenge but after awhile if we rely on coffee to keep us upright, other things will break. So, try for a week to stop 8 hours before bed time - and after that week - play around. You might also wish to check out adding to that, reducing the amount of coffee you drink overall - but doesn't sound like a lot anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about using coffee strategically - if you're doing something creative - see if having a coffee makes a difference; if you're doing a workout - see if coffee 20-30 mins before your heavy sets makes a difference - and if it does do you need it all the time - or maybe again strategically on particular sessions only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get into the pleasure of coffee as a beverage. 
Like building up a taste for dark, special really well made chocolate ups experience and reduces cravings (a little intense shot goes a long way), consider doing this with coffee. 
personal story: it's gotten to a point with me that I really prefer to roll my own: I pick the beans, grind them, make my coffee and enjoy it with intent - or with colleagues who share that experience. I no longer enjoy grabbing just any coffee. This means I have one or two cups a day (or sometimes none at all) because I enjoy the real thing so much I don't spend my caffeine/coffee nickle anywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So take-aways are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test it for yourself - It's not only you in one moment but learning how different contexts affect this beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider strategic dosing if that's what you're using it for
else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe explore getting into coffee as a gorgeous food that you can give yourself as a daily ritual / treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about tapering off from time to time to re-up your sensitivity and enjoy even more - without being any food that's a drug too b**ch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the best
m.c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS - On effect on both workout intensity and on fat burning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because coffee is a food and has way more going on than caffeine, when I'm really focused on the caffeine properties around work outs (super hard training for an event) or fat burning (when already just a wee bit away from target body fat) I prefer to use caffeine pills as part of a "stack" for those effects - this may be way outside anything of interest, but it's just a focus/control thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Odd coffee notation on menus</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;On a trip to Texas I've noticed that espresso drinks are listed on menu boards as "3 oz.," "6 oz.," and "8 oz.," instead of "cortado," "cappuccino," and "latte," respectively. I have not seen this notation anywhere else. Is it unique to Texas, or a new convention that is still catching on, or what?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;i'm wondering if this is a wee joke?
In any coffee joint in north america it's common to have a name for the size of a drink like vente, grande or small medim large, BUT these are also associated with eactly these kinds of OZ sizes &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example &lt;a href="https://customerservice.starbucks.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3113" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;on the startbucks coffee sizes page&lt;/a&gt;, it reads&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drink sizes we currently offer are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short [8 fl. oz.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tall [12 fl. oz.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grande [16 fl. oz.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Venti® Hot [20 fl. oz.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Venti® Cold [24 fl. oz.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also, i may be reading you incorrectly but
"cortado," "cappuccino," and "latte,"
are types of drinks;
oz on the other hand are sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can have any size applied to a latte for example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;???
apologies if i have misinterpretted you.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Will emptying used coffee grounds into the sink drain damage my pipes?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been using a French press and emptying the grounds into the sink afterwards The main reason for doing this is that I read somewhere that coffee grounds are a good way to deter pests like cockroaches. I figured washing the used grounds down the drain would keep them from setting up shop in the sink. It only recently occurred to me that this might not be such a good idea and I wanted to know from the more experienced coffee drinkers if I should stop doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You don‘t need the advice of coffee drinkers, you need advice from a plumber (which I am admittedly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, but I have enough contacts in the industry) and a gardener to chime in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: &lt;strong&gt;Don’t do it.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee grounds may smell nice and there is that persistent old wives’ tale that will claim that it has [some random positive effect]. It’s not true. Any plumber will tell you that it’s best to pour nothing except liquids down the drains. Coffee grounds are particles that may&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clump together &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collect like sediment in traps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bind to other fatty residue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide food to microorganisms that form that slimy and stinky biofilm in the pipes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, most plumbers will love you for the habit of washing down your grounds, because it keeps them in business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee grounds are lovely additions for compost, so either simply add them to your garden compost or treat them like you would any other plant-based kitchen waste.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Espresso consistency</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Amateur just getting started with a Breville - not happy with the results but I know I have lots to learn so I'll start with an aspect I am curious of - consistency. The Breville guide says the consistency of the shot flowing down should be of honey. First thing I say with my experience is no way, no how - mine flows through the filter like standard liquid. Things I know I need to ensure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a better grind - I am not using a burr grinder (yet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting the grind right - not too powdery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;water temp - not sure what to do about this - the machine has control of that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let's start with the consistency - should it really be like honey? If so, I'm no where near that and how can I be? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7fTiP.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7fTiP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I'm talking about - how the heck is it so thick; and the color...&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's not really about consistency but more about getting the right extraction time for the coffee/water ratio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule of thumb is to get a shot in approximately 25 seconds, with a 1:2 ratio of coffee/water. So you'd have 16g of coffee in your portafilter, to get a 32g expresso shot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the baseline. When you achieve that, you can start experimenting with different ratios and times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are you grinding your beans? If you don't have a grinder you only have the dosage to play with, and it's gonna be really difficult to get to that baseline. &lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Tap water or bottled water?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What is generally considered better for the perfect cup of filtered coffee. Tap water or bottled water?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water in London, UK is fairly soft but has loads of calcium in it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottled water I have heard has lots of salt in it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is best?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just think that your drink, coffee, is around 97-98% water so you need quality water to make a quality cup of coffee due the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap water, beside the calcium, will have additional components and too much calcium will give a taste of acidity to the coffee, calcium makes the water harder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to get a fruity taste from your cup of coffee you need to focus on the balance between magnesium and calcium, magnesium will extract flavor from the beans ... now you know why all the coffee shop coffee taste close to each others and is due the source of water is used( all use tap water) makes them high acidity and requires sugar+cream in order to enjoy that cup :( &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodium does make the coffee taste acidic like the calcium does so you need balanced or spring water to see difference or even distilled water but the coffee will loose drastically from the flavor ... unbalanced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least the bottled water you know has added magnesium for taste and is in a balance with other minerals including calcium(not looking does stay in plastic bottles ... that is a different story and think tap water pipes and source of water/process used to make “safe” for drinking)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: I roast the batches of coffee home and in order to feel the
  right flavor tried distilled water, tap water and spring water;
  Currently I use only spring water fresh from the ground and filtered
  so coffee or tea doesn’t require butter, creamer or any other flavors
  added in order to feel the real taste. Same does come to sodium.Even tea does follow same path
  when does come to the water .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing, boil the water and check the sediment left to compare the “tap vs bottled”, “tap vs spring”, “spring vs purified/bottled”. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>I made a mistake ordering ground coffee - will Expresso ground coffee work for a French Press?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Can someone tell me the difference between Expresso ground coffee and French Press ground coffee? I placed an order for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B076BMC2HD" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this ground coffee&lt;/a&gt;, but only realised after arrival that I should have chosen the French Press option. I have a French Press. I don't have a Expresso machine. I don't drink coffee, hence the mistake. I run an Airbnb and it's for my guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what to do with it if it's not usable for a French Press. It's not returnable to Amazon. Perhaps let some future guests have it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h3&gt;Ideally from a business setting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Order new coffee and give the grounds away to someone who can make espresso from it. You could offer it as a gift to guests or others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do end up using it for the guests, make sure you indicate the problem. If possible, try one of the methods below yourself first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On actually using the coffee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't be too worried about the grounds coming through the mesh, they almost certainly will. This is easily solved by pouring your coffee through a paper filter. I know don't normally do that for French press, but in this case it seems sensible to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd be more worried about extraction time and taste. When I make French press, I grind as fine as possible without it becoming to bitter, with a consistent time the particles are still larger than holes in the mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the coffee is already ground, you can play with two factors: time and dose. You probably want to use less time then you're used to. The dose is difficult, if you use too little coffee, you won't get a full body. If you use too much, it will taste very bitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can try to make &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/turkish-coffee" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;turkish-coffee&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;turkish-coffee&lt;/a&gt; in a pan.

  <title>Coffee tasting notes: myth or reality?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;This is what it says on my current beans:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;lots of raisin and candied fruit peel is backed up by a creamy sweetness that makes me think of a Creme Brulee - right down to the little hints of caramel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get a couple of these a week, and this one is pretty restrained - it's normally 100 words of fanciful hyperbole which could have been produced by a random word generator. This one is a Central American Bourbon, with no useful information at all - altitude, soil, cleaning, processing, anything. And, more often than not, you have to google the farm to find out what varietal it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what's going on? Do vendors just make this stuff up? Does anyone actually taste any of this stuff and, if they do, is it just Synaesthesia? What about the obvious problem, which is that Humans can taste pretty much nothing, and we only have a small number (48??) of different smell receptors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, I can smell (and taste, just) lots of different 'notes' in an espresso. The same roaster, for example, can &lt;em&gt;consistently&lt;/em&gt; do fantastic El Salvador SL28, and an undrinkable Kenyan SL28. But nowhere in there can I detect anything remotely 'fruity', or 'chocolaty', or 'caramelly', or anything apart from different 'coffee'.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a defined set of tasting note terms, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://worldcoffeeresearch.org/work/sensory-lexicon/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;World Coffee Research Sensory Lexicon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which is the basis for the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Coffee%20Taster%27s%20Flavor%20Wheel&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;bih=862" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Coffee Taster's Flavor Wheel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those terms are intended to name specific tastes and you can take a class to learn how to recognize them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I've not yet taken such a class, I can't testify to the reliability or utility of "flavor notes" on packages, but surely some writers are way off in fantasy land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, some staffers at big coffee chains are not even clear on the distinction between flavor notes and added flavoring!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it possible to further roast instant coffee granules?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Can I take standard roasted instant coffee granules and further roast them in the oven?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this doable, or even advisable?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;No, I don’t think that’s feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you roast coffee beans, the beans undergo chemical changes that create the desirable flavor components. When you afterwards grind the beans and brew your coffee, the flavor components are extracted into the water. If (whole!) beans you bought are not roasted enough for your liking, you can try to re-roast, although the results may not be exactly what you were aiming for. Theoretically possible nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, for instant coffee you need to remember that instant coffee is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; finely-ground coffee beans, but &lt;em&gt;prepared (=brewed and filtered)&lt;/em&gt; coffee that has been freeze-dried, clumps up into small granules and can be reconstituted by adding water. The beans that are changed in the regular roasting process simply aren’t there in instant coffee, which is why you won’t be able to develop the desired flavors by roasting instant coffee. You may be able to create some burnt flavors, but I don’t think that’s what you want. You should also note that the instant coffee granules are not very stable and likely to break up and, depending on your home-roasting method and tools, may clog up and damage your equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is an Americano the same as drip coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm curious about the difference between an Americano (espresso + water) and drip coffee (grounds + water).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does an Americano taste the same as black drip coffee? Whats the difference in caffeine levels? Process?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h3&gt;Differences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crema&lt;/strong&gt;: an espresso has &lt;a href="https://coffee.fandom.com/wiki/Crema" rel="noreferrer"&gt;crema&lt;/a&gt; whereas drip brew coffee doesn't. The reason for this is that an espresso is pulled under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper filtered&lt;/strong&gt;: drip brew tends to be filtered by paper of cloth, filtering out oily components. From &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00217-013-1917-x" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Comparison of nine common coffee extraction methods: instrumental and sensory analysis&lt;/a&gt; (where the French press is similar to espresso in that it isn't paper filtered):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The most efficient extraction of fatty acids was performed with French Press extraction. Brewing with a paper filter resulted in coffee with the lowest fatty acid content, which is consistent with the findings of Peters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this doesn't apply to all drip brews, metal filters don't filter out oily components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;(Possible) similarities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt;: since an Americano is a diluted  espresso, you can make it the same strength as a drip brew coffee by adding an appropriate amount of water. The opposite isn't true, you cannot make a drip coffee that has espresso-strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: both are made using roasted coffee and water only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Dialling in with a Barista express</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently got hold of a Sage (=Breville) Barista express, which has a built in grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t been getting great results with it so far. Also, there seems to be a kind of mismatch between the settings on the machine itself and what I am reading online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The double basket takes 15 - 18g of coffee, but the double shot button pushes through 60ml of water for a ratio of 1:4 or just under. You can control extraction manually but that seems weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I’ve read I want 1:2 or just under if I’m making a flat white, so I have been going for 35g of espresso out of 17.5g of coffee in around 26s, not counting pre-infusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get somewhere around those numbers, I have to be on the second finest setting (this is with beans that were roasted in the last 3 weeks) and the needle on the pressure gauge goes beyond the “espresso range” marked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all seems pretty bizarre – the shot is nothing out of the ordinary but the settings are at the extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shots I am getting still taste under-extracted to me. If I go a step finer my extraction time goes way way up, so I also have to reduce the amount of coffee.
Is that the way to go, or should I keep the grind the same and run more water through?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking the fact that everything is at the extreme (portafilter packed as full as it will go, grind setting more or less as fine as it will go, pressure out of range) should tell me something, but what? Just that they built the machine around a ratio of around 1:4? I don't understand why they would do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried changing the beans btw – it didn’t really make any difference.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have a Sage with a built-in grinder as well. The grinder isn't great, it has some inconsistency that may clog part of your filter basket just enough to reduce the flow a bit more than you'll like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've solved this by adding a wet paper filter before adding the coffee. For this I use paper filters meant for AeroPress, which are only slightly too big for my portafilter (like 2 millimeters too large in diameter). My technique is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Push some water through the filter basket to warm it up a bit, then dry with a paper towel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a pre-wetted paperfilter to the bottom of the portafilter, press it down with your fingers. It's okay if the sides of the paper filter go up a little bit against the wall of the portafilter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add your ground coffee as you normally do and tamp. Then pull the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this allows me to push a bit more water through compared to keeping everything the same without the paper filter. My theory is that it keeps the holes in the filter basket nice and clear so the water gets pushed through more easily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing that this is a pretty cheap option, I'd give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I tend to go with a coarse grind for my Chemex, but ultimately, it should depend on the flow through rate and your desired extraction.

I've heard rumors that it's &lt;a href="https://www.home-barista.com/coffees/do-big-chains-like-starbucks-caribou-disclose-roast-date-t3990.html#p43514" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;7 months&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/69jc8p/how_to_know_the_roast_date_of_starbucks_coffee/dh761jy/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;8 months&lt;/a&gt; before the expiration or "best by" date, but is there an authoritative source for this information?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Starbucks is a huge company that wants to reduce the costs. Therefore, it is expected that they optimize for profit most of the time, not for the taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One cost-saving approach is to have lots of beans, roasting them all together right after the harvest --when the beans are easily available, then pack them and send to many other selling points --sometimes overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it might be expected that shipping numerous of containers of packed beans overseas may take a while. However, we cannot just estimate this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One note, checking the packaging date may help you do a closer estimation. I'm not aware of the legislation around the globe, but when I check a bag of beans in the nearby store, every time till now, the typed date is enough for me to throw the bag as far away as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Espresso machine stops working after making 2 cups</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've had the DeLonghi EC680 for about a year now. It is still working, but there is something wrong with it. It is able to make two cups of coffee in a row, but when I am trying to make the third one, the noise from the machine becomes quieter and no coffee is coming out. Then, when I turn off the machine for a bit and try again, it works just fine. I descaled it recently and cleaned the filter, but the problem is still there. What could be the problem and what could I do to fix it? Thanks for any help.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A machine turning itself off and working fine after a resting period sounds like a protective mechanism jumping in. If pulling multiple cups was fine in the past and now isn’t, it seems like some piece of the inner machinery gets too hot, and lime scale may or may not be the explanation. If you have a particular heavy buildup, it’s possible that one regular descaling cycle has been not strong enough to fully break down the deposits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first step would be to run the descaling at least once more and if possible extend the “soaking” time. That should also deal with particles floating in the system that were loosened in the first descaling and may now have wandered around and create a blockage. Rinse well afterwards, not only to get rid of the acidic cleaner, but also because of lime scale chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that doesn’t help, it’s time to contact a repair service. &lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Is the moka pot predisposed to producing burnt or bitter coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I bought a moka pot in the hope of producing coffee that more closely resembled espresso. And using good coffee, and experimenting with technique, I have produced some very rich, nicely-balanced extractions. However, I have been able to reduce, but never fully remove, some underlying burnt notes in the coffee produced. This problem has led me to ask myself about the nature of the moka pot design itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water in the chamber is heated and the vapour inside trapped. Once the vapour pressure in the chamber is great enough, it forces the heated water up the spout, through the coffee charge, and into the collection chamber. My experience has led me to ask: is the heat required to produce adequate vapour pressure is not inherently higher than the ideal, hence predisposing the moka pot to producing bitter or burnt coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also raises questions about best practice in moka pot coffee extraction. It would suggest that the best extraction would be when ambient air pressure is lower, the coffee charge is not tamped, the water is heated gradually, and the water is not fully consumed (i.e. the extraction is terminated before the water in the chamber is gone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own experimentation would tend to confirm the notion of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; tamping the charge, but I have had limited success associating technique with outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have any objective measurements been made with regard to the temperature and pressure inside a moka pot, with the charge tamped or untamped? And how do those measurements compare with the theoretical ideals for coffee extraction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is nothing I've tried myself, but to add onto your theory of the heat required to brew the Moka-Pot, I believe we'll arrive at an answer. The problem is not likely the water temperature itself, it turns out it's realistically pretty difficult to get boiling water onto coffee when using some sort of brew method (as the metal absorbs enough heat to drop the water temp). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the lengthy heat time on the mokapot will actually heat up the ground coffee itself during brew, and this can lead to poor tasting coffee. The best thing you can do, from my understanding is pre-heat the mokapot bottom and start with hot water before assembling and putting on the stove. Additionally, as soon as the coffee starts spurting, it's done and you can run under cool water to halt brewing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got most of this info from a mokapot video I saw a while back, thought it might help you as well: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyBYuu-wJI" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyBYuu-wJI&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Brikka either too bubbly crema or doesn't work</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;so I'm still new to brewing with Brikka and I found my results are quite inconsistent. So, I try to follow each steps and the how to make coffee part on the product manual. Cold water, fill the funnel with ground coffee, etc. But what I've found is basically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I don't tamp (just a tiny bit, not hard at all, to level the coffee and remove empty spaces between), usually it doesn't work. It brews, let out a bit of coffee, but there's no the usual brikka sound and usually steam comes out from the valve. Being too paranoid, I usually turn it off and redo (I'm too scared it will explode or something), make a new cup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if I tamp a bit, more often the crema that comes out are too 'bubbly'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't really understand why, can anyone enlighten me? Thanks a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brikka has a safety valve  integrated in the base which should prevent blowing up. However, the coffee will likely be burnt if the steam comes out of the side for a long time. You can try using a lond spoon/knife to lift the weight manually to not waste the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally I would advise against tamping the coffee at all. The amount of pressure it needs to lift the weight and the point where the safety valve opens isn't too far apart. If you tamp, the water needs to exert pressure against the coffee and the weight which is often too much or takes too long.
The key is to find the correct grind size. Start with too coarse, fill the basket, remove excess from top and don't tamp. The coffee should extract quickly with a sigle "swoosh" but taste and crema will be on the light side.
Now start reducing the grind size until you hear a bit of a strain in the "swoosh" and it will take a bit longer. This is the point you are aiming for. Since the Brikka does preinfusion, the swelling grounds will provide enough resistance to get the oils out and thus the crema. If the safety valve opens, it was too fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important measure of coffee is taste, so I'd suggest try to get the taste right before worrying about how the crema looks which is very dependent on the beans, their age, the roast. (dark roasts with lots of robusta if you want crema) Keep in mind that not all roasts are equally suited for the brikka and that due to the lower pressure you won't get the same kind of crema a portafilter machine will make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Should I flush the Nuova Simonelli Oscar II before pulling a shot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just got my first espresso machine, a Nuova Simonelli Oscar II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When watching other people use the machine (on YouTube), I see some flushing the machine for about 2 seconds before every shot. Some don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the point of this operation?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Flushing helps clear any residue that might be left inside the machine or grinds stuck to the group screen before pulling your next shot. It also helps bring the group head up to temp before you lock the portafilter, so your first bit of hot water doesn't get cold as soon as it hits your puck.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Baratza Encore is grinding too coarse</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Listing out details as I best know. I'm stuck on what might be wrong or if there is anything I can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purchased used Baratza Encore off Facebook Marketplace 2.5 months ago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been using grinder every single day, mainly for Chemex pourovers, in the 18-22 grind size range&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple days ago, noticed it was grinder very coarse in my usual range. Also, doesn't seem like much of a difference between 16 - 22&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I took the grinder apart to recalibrate the little screw. Moved it into the fine section to calibrate the grinder finer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same problem. No difference in grind between 16-22, haven't tried outside those ranges yet, and it's grinding very coarse, like french press or even cold brew size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any ideas on what I can do, or is it time for a new grinder? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have the grinder myself too, and from what I recall (haven't used it for a while) the number scale doesn't correspond with a specific grind size. I haven't taken it apart, but when I would thoroughly clean it (mostly taking out residue coffee dust with a vacuum cleaner), I think I had to set it a bit finer (maybe 2 or 3 on the number scale) to achieve the same results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing that you took the grinding mechanism itself apart as well, I wouldn't be surprised if the number scale is a bit further off compared to what you were used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if you can achieve the same grind size you used before, I'd simply grind finer until you get there. If you get down to the lowest setting and the grind isn't getting to the desired level (which you previously did get from the same machine) then there's probably a problem with the way the machine was reassembled.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is coffee grinder adjustability worth the higher price?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of bean grinders out there and some include a feature to set grinding grain (steps between coarse and fine) while others have no such setting and make a finer grind bb grinding longer. The second type is much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the inclusion of these fancier settings in a coffee grinder (which usually bumps up the price) worth it, as far as getting the right grind level?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You absolutely want to be able to choose grind size&lt;/strong&gt; - even if you have a preferred brewing method and beans, you still want to be able to make some adjustments up or down if necessary. Even more so if you are going to experiment with brewing methods, where the required grind size ranges from super fine powder (Turkish Mokka) to coarse grain (cold brew). And it is a good idea to pick a grinder that has its strength at the coarseness you need most - few will actually cover the whole range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the really important detail is how &lt;strong&gt;homogeneous&lt;/strong&gt; the grind is. If you have a wide range of particle sizes, you will get over &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; under extracted coffee at the same time and it will be a compromise at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I would &lt;em&gt;strongly recommend&lt;/em&gt; that you invest in a &lt;strong&gt;burr grinder&lt;/strong&gt;, that should be the kind where you can set and adjust the grind size. As said before, read a few reviews before selecting the model that matches your needs and budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blade grinders&lt;/strong&gt; work like food processors, chopping up the beans with a rotating knife and the longer they run, the finer the grind will be - so the time you run them is sort of a grind selector. By design they produce a less homogeneous result (depending on how the blade hits the beans, some particles will be bigger, some smaller), which will sometimes work for coarse grinds, but not for fine ones. They are often cheaper, though, which is why some users pick them over burr grinders. I would not choose one if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reason why some pros recommend to spend equal amounts on your grinder and your espresso machine. If you are brewing with a low-budget method (e.g. pour-over by hand), the grinder will likely be the most expensive piece of equipment - and probably worth the investment.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does fresh-ground coffee taste worse than pre-ground?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My Baratza Encore grinder has been the worst purchase I've ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, the machine does its job perfectly - it transforms big pieces of coffee into little ones with consistency and speed. The problem is, every pot of coffee I make with freshly-ground beans comes out thin and watery. Or, if I add more coffee (or modify the grind size) over-extracted and watery. I don't have this same problem with using pre-ground stuff from the supermarket in the same coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a pretty standard Hamilton Beach drip maker on &amp;quot;Regular&amp;quot; setting. Pre-ground coffee usually comes out between &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pretty alright&amp;quot; with one heaping tablespoon per &amp;quot;2 cup&amp;quot; marker on the tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got the grinder I started experimenting with grind size and bean. I've since brewed more than 20 pots have not yet had a single one that I wanted to finish; I've varied grind sizes, coffee portions, tried different roasts...nothing comes out right. I've tried both exacting measurements and seat-of-the-pants tablespoons but always come up short. I've compared my ground beans to the store-bought stuff to make sure it's the same but still no luck. The only coffee to come of the grinder that was drinkable is the coarsely-ground coffee I've made into cold brew. I also experimented with a french press but gave up in frustration there as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like a good cup of coffee but also don't want much fuss in the morning. So far, the experience of trying to grind my own coffee has been nothing but an outrageous frustration. What am I doing wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, if I add more coffee (or modify the grind size) over-extracted and watery. I don't have this same problem with using pre-ground stuff from the supermarket in the same coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a pretty standard Hamilton Beach drip maker on &amp;quot;Regular&amp;quot; setting. Pre-ground coffee usually comes out between &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pretty alright&amp;quot; with one heaping tablespoon per &amp;quot;2 cup&amp;quot; marker on the tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might also be that you're not measuring fairly. A tablespoon of pre-ground coffee may have a different weight to a tablespoon of coffee you grind yourself. To be more consistent, I suggest using weight-based ratios. For example 1:15 which means you use 1 part coffee to 15 parts water (both measured by weight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to explain a watery result is that you're using too little coffee for the amount of water you're adding. If it tastes over-extracted when you increase the dosage (the amount of coffee) then you might be grinding too fine. An easy way to check for this is by grinding coarser and sticking to the aforementioned brew ratio. If it tastes over-extracted at that ratio then it means your grinds are too fine.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee and teeth health</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Are there any good sources of information about the effect coffee has on the health of teeth? These could be scientific sources and material for readers who are not medical experts.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Since this site is about coffee, not dentistry, I will answer from a Coffee perspective. I can think of three issues with coffee that can affect one's teeth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acidity. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34392-w" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Brewed coffee has a pH around 5&lt;/a&gt;. That means it is an acidic beverage, but not as acidic &lt;a href="https://edu.rsc.org/soundbite/coca-cola/2021233.article" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Coca Cola which has a pH as low as 2.6&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/ph-levels-apple-orange-grape-cranberry-fruit-juices-12062.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;many fruits which have pH levels ranging from 2.3 to 4.2&lt;/a&gt;. It's about &lt;a href="https://www.vahdamteas.com/blogs/tea-us/is-tea-acidic" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the same as black tea which has pH levels ranging from 4.9 to 5.5&lt;/a&gt;. Coffee acidity may affect dental health because &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_erosion" rel="noreferrer"&gt;acidic foods can erode the teeth&lt;/a&gt;. Coffee is a bit on the border with sources saying &lt;a href="https://www.dentistryiq.com/dental-hygiene/clinical-hygiene/article/16350765/the-magic-of-ph" rel="noreferrer"&gt;tooth demineralization may start at a pH of 5.5&lt;/a&gt; (and lower pH means increased acidity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tannins. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannin#Drinks_with_tannins" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Coffee contains tannins&lt;/a&gt;, which are a class of chemical compounds. According to &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/what-does-coffee-do-to-your-teeth" rel="noreferrer"&gt;healthline.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tannins cause color compounds to stick to your teeth. When these compounds stick, they can leave an unwanted yellow hue behind. It only takes one cup of coffee a day to cause stained teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar. Of course not all coffee contains a lot of sugar, but sugar is commonly added to coffee. Sugar affects dental hygiene because bacteria in the mouth feed on the sugars (and in turn &lt;a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-microbiology/chapter/bacterial-diseases-of-the-mouth/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;they produce acids that may damage the teeth&lt;/a&gt;). As &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sugars-and-dental-caries" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the WHO writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of dental caries occurs in adults because the disease is cumulative. There is a clear dose-response relationship between sugars consumption and dental caries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Is there any difference (besides caffeine content) between decaf and regular coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is there any real difference between these two types of coffee? Say for example I have beans from the same crop of coffee, I send half through the decaffeination process and the other half I don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roasted and brewed in the same manner, all else being the same, will there be any difference? For example: Flavor, antioxidant levels, health benefits/detriments? I always have heard that coffee can be good for you, but I am very sensitive to caffeine. Am I missing out on anything by simply drinking decaf?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that decaffeinated coffee is coffee that has had caffeine content removed. To my knowledge, there is no such thing as naturally uncaffinated coffee. Since the coffee starts with caffeine and is sold to you without the caffeine, you can assume (rightly) that decaffeinated coffee undergoes more processing than &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do they do it, then? There are several ways in use today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemical rinse. The (green) beans are steamed to heat and wet them, causing slight expansion. The beans are then rinsed with a chemical solvent that dissolves the caffeine. Unfortunately, this process also washes out a good bit of the oils and solid compounds that give coffee its flavor. That solution after flushing then needs to be treated to remove the chemical solvent. The beans are then reintroduced to the remaining solution, and the water is boiled away or allowed to evaporate, leaving behind the compounds that were flushed from the beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water bath. The green beans are soaked in water and occasionally agitated for some time. The water dissolves most (but not all) of the caffeine. Then, the beans are removed from the water, and a similar chemical solvent to the chemical rinse method is used to dissolve the caffeine in the water. Finally, the beans are then treated just like the chemical rinse method. The resulting solution is treated to remove the chemical solvent, then the beans are reintroduced to the water for reduction and reapplication of coffee solids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filtering. This is similar to the water bath method, except instead of using a chemical solvent to remove the caffeine, a filter is used. The solution is passed through a filter repeatedly until measured caffeine content is minimal. This method of course removes some coffee solids also, since filters only discriminate based on molecule size. But caffeine molecules are relatively large, so this method is reasonably affective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide solvent. This method uses carbon dioxide to flush out caffeine by heating and applying high pressure to bring the CO2 to a supercritical state (where it acts as both a liquid and a gas). In this state, the CO2 is force at high pressure through the crevices of heated beans, where it dissolves caffeine (and mostly only caffeine) on contact. The CO2 solution is then purged from the beans and allowed to evaporate away, and the remaining coffee can be collected separately from the beans. Obviously this method is expensive and more technically challenging than the other two methods so isn't in common use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there are different methods for removing caffeine from coffee and because each method requires a degree of precision to execute completely perfectly, approximation of the flavor of decaffeinated coffee to the flavor of the same, preprocessed coffee varies method to method and even batch to batch. In first two methods, for example, it's hard to ensure even distribution of the dissolved coffee compounds among the decaffeinated beans when reintroducing them. The other methods face similar challenges, except for CO2, which is, as I said above, just plain expensive. All of this means that even though decaffeinated coffee &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; taste mostly like regular coffee, it never will taste &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; like regular coffee. And whether it ever comes close enough is hard to say since the processes aren't perfectly consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is a ceramic pitcher suitable for frothing milk?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently bought a Gaggia Classic with a steam wand. I don't have a stainless steel pitcher for frothing my milk and am using a ceramic one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anybody know whether this has a significant impact on the ability to froth the milk properly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could imagine it has lower thermal conductivity, but higher mass, so it may influence how quickly or how evenly the milk is warmed up during the steaming. And the shape may have an impact on how well the milk is aerated.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think ceramic shouldn't pose any problem in terms of heating. Since the heating element is in the center, sticking in the milk, it shouldn't affect evenness. The material may absorb a significant amount of heat and slow down the steaming process, but that may actually be helpful. It may give you more time to spin the milk and make the nice microfoam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big disadvantage I think is going to be weight. In order to be sturdy and resistant to shattering, the walls have to be pretty thick. So it may put more strain on your wrist and arm and take more effort and energy out of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, IMO the biggest issues with ceramic vs. steel are that the ceramic will cause more &amp;quot;human-factor&amp;quot; problems. But the product should be just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new coworker, a good guy and a coffee connoisseur explained me that there's a good reason for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no good reason besides pure laziness. The stale coffee starts to oxidise and gets rancid fairly quickly, negatively impacting the next brew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best practice, which I've done myself and seen done in countless (specialty) cafés, is to knock out the grounds into a knock box and then wipe up the small bits of ground coffee with a microfiber cloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your type of portafilter there still may be a few drops of brewed coffee between the basket and spout, but this is barely enough to negatively impact the taste of the next coffee slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not in a rush and you want to go a step further, you can put the portafilter into the brew head with no ground coffee and just let it run hot water through it for a few seconds. This has the added benefit that any fluids or particles stuck in the brew head will also be flushed out.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Where to buy small batches of unroasted beans</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I want to dabble in home roasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where can one typically source unroasted beans from? Do roasters typically sell unroasted beans to the public? I have never seen unroasted beans for sale in a store. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not asking for specific store or supplier recommendations, more so the general avenues to source unroasted beans.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are several websites that sell unroasted or green beans in a range of quantities and will ship.  I have heard that Costco or maybe it was Sam's Club were selling them as well (albeit in larger quantities).  Keep in mind that shipping can be prohibitively expensive for small quantities.  I order 12 pounds at a time from &lt;a href="https://www.sweetmarias.com/store/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sweet Marias&lt;/a&gt; and they ship in a flat rate USPS box; so shipping is very reasonable and only adds roughly a dollar per pound (for a twelve pound order).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know are other good websites out there, but Sweet Marias has provided me with excellent customer service when I've had order issues (burst bags in shipping) and their website is very thorough, including forums, education and product reviews/recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Are coffee enhancers bad for you?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I buy Buisman Royal Aroma Coffee enhancer from our local Dutch shop.  It halves the coffee grounds needed and makes the coffee taste stronger.  It is basically burnt sugar, as far as I understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it bad for you?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;That site that you linked (from www.buismaningredients.com, and &lt;a href="http://www.dutchfoodinnovations.com/organisation/buisman-ingredients" rel="nofollow"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) suggest that the main ingredient is caramelised sugar. The claim is simple enough: "caramelised sugars enrich the taste of coffee" (from cited articles). &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramelization" rel="nofollow"&gt;Caramelisation&lt;/a&gt; is the thermal decomposition of sugar (sucrose); not precisely "burnt" as such but similar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't find any ingredient list for that product, but the company that makes it basically produces just caramelised sugar and caramel color. I can't find any negative health claims for caramelised sugar itself other than the basic ones for regular sugar (blood-sugar effects, teeth effects, etc.). Some have concerns about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramel_color#Toxicology" rel="nofollow"&gt;caramel color&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What grind setting should I use for french press using a Capresso Infinity conical burr grinder?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;After years of suffering through with a blade grinder, I have finally bought a Capresso Infinity conical burr grinder. Now I need to figure out the settings to get the best cup of coffee I can from my French press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I know that I need a coarse grind for a French press. There are four coarse settings on the grinder. I also know that there are a lot of dependencies (especially brew time, types of beans, etc.). What experience have people had with the coarse settings of this particular grinder, and are there any good rules of thumb here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a coffee lover, but am new to the finer points of coffee making (just switched to a French press from drip in the last year) and am looking for any advice that may be pertinent. Many thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I would recommend looking for which coarse setting seems to produce the most even grind. Really, the only potential danger you have is grinding so fine that you can't push the screen down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I recommend this is, like you mentioned, because everything else can be altered to your coffee's grind - the water temperature and extraction time. So you'll want to dial in a grind that's going to be evenly extracted. If your most coarse setting gives you big chunks and a lot of fine particles as well, then you're either going to over extract the fine and under extract the coarse, or vice versa depending on your brew time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hesitate to give you a dogmatic answer because I don't want to mislead you, but I also understand that it takes time to recognize even grinding and the grind size that is appropriate for the brew method. So I'll say that somewhere around medium to medium-coarse is going to be better. With smaller burr grinders, the coarsest setting has pretty uneven results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, try playing with the extraction time. Start with two minutes, then try 3, on up to 5. If you keep everything consistent, you should be able to find exactly what works/tastes best for your situation.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What happens if I use a Nespresso capsule with the "wrong" amount of water?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My office has a Nespresso machine. My preferred drink (for taste and caffeine content) is the Espresso Leggero but often all these capsules are gone, so I use maybe a Ristretto capsule or a Luongo capsule, but still use the middle button (espresso amount of drink, I asssume).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this do, to the taste and caffeine content? Are the capsules optimised for a certain amount of drink?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You will either over-extract or under-extract the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over-extraction occurs when you run too much water through and you will be able to see this as the coffee turns pale and eventually you will end up with almost clear (or barely tinted) water running through. Over-extracted coffee tastes bitter. Really badly over-extracted coffee can sometimes exhibit metallic or plastic taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under-extraction is a much better option. The resulting coffee will be thicker, stickier and less bitter. The downside is that you are not getting the maximum utilisation from the beans and you could have made more acceptable coffee with those beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ristretto is a short extraction with minimal water and ideally at a slightly lower pressure. An espresso should be the same coffee, but the extraction would use more water and often a slightly faster flow rate / higher pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caffeine content will mostly be dependent on the beans used and the quantity of coffee in the pod. A longer extraction may increase the caffeine content slightly, but not enough to be noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does instant coffee give a lesser buzz/high than conventional filter/french press coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have felt that percolated/french pressed coffee keeps me awake more than instant coffee brew. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Since it was (validly) pointed out it will depend on the amount, so the amount, that I am comparing is basically what is mentioned on the packet of instant or ground coffee (whichever is the case). 
As in if my instant coffee sachet says it makes 2 cups of coffee, I use half of it. And if the ground coffee says to use the filtrate of 2 tablespoons for each cup, I do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Caffeine content varies greatly by preparation and brew method.  Instant coffee is generally designed to produce something close to a cup of drip coffee.  "Cups" is unfortunately not well defined and may vary based on it's usage.  Beyond that, percolated and french press coffee is generally prepared stronger (more concentrated) that regular drip coffee (and probably much stronger than the watered down concentration instant is designed for).  It's also very likely that some amount of caffeine is lost during the freeze dry process since it is so water soluble.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Yes.  Real brewed coffee will generally have a higher caffeine concentration than coffee that has been brewed, dehydrated, then re-hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the Roasterie's city of fountains blend?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I eat roasted coffee beans on occasion, and usually all taste about the same. But I have noticed that beans from the &lt;a href="https://www.theroasterie.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Roasterie&lt;/a&gt;'s City of Fountains blend have a rather burnt flavor.

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Beans that are sold by giant retailers aren't known for being great.  Most companies moving such a significant amount of coffee (and mostly cheaply) are mainly looking for a supplier who can provide a large volume and quality secondarily.  Dark roasting such beans effectively hides the origin flavors (or lack thereof) and provides a certain level of uniformity (you will consistently get the roast tastes).  It's unlikely the beans are "burnt leftovers" since that kind of sorting or sale to another company after over roast accidents would only add to the cost and complexity of getting the product to market.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>If I leave my brewed coffee to rest, will it lose caffeine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I prefer to drink coffee cold.  So, after the coffee is done brewing, I leave it to rest for some time and drink it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will the coffee lose its strength, if it is cooling down?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes, but not in any significant or noticeable amounts.  Caffeine is stable in solution for quite some time.  Considering a average cup of coffee (~100mg of caffeine), you may lose a few milligrams of caffeine over an extended rest period.  Given that caffeine content varies in any given cup of coffee (many sources list variations as wide as 60mg to 200mg, or more) you are unlikely to notice any difference in the caffeine content.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you may notice is a difference in the taste.  They are many suggestions out there on how to cold brew coffee.  It may be worth your time to research an alternate brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does the caffeine content differ in "ristretto" shots?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My intuition tells me the difference in caffeine content will be slight to non-existent between regular shots and ristretto shots. But perhaps I'm not adequately accounting for the reduced volume. And I don't actually know the little details that might contribute to an educated guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which part of the pour has the highest concentration of caffeine? What are the temperature and pressure ranges within which caffeine extraction is most effective? Does the color of the crema indicate anything about the caffeine levels in a single shot?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Well first off what is your definition of ristretto? It's very frequently misunderstood to mean simply a short shot of espresso, when really it's all about your coffee to yield ratio. Ristretto styled shots range somewhere in the 1:1 to 1:1.5 range (arguably). For example if you put in 18 grams of coffee, and then yield out 20 grams of espresso (1:1.1)- then you are somewhere in the land of ristretto. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean as far as caffeine goes? There is no difference at all. Whether you are pulling a normale or a ristretto shot, you still want an extraction somewhere around 20% of the original coffee mass. This means that you are extracting the exact same amount of coffee, but simply putting that into a smaller amount of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing to look at is that caffeine is one of the first compounds that is extracted in the extraction process. So even if you decided to pull the shot a bit short and under extract it, you should still have the same caffeine content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry I have no sources or citation. I hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can I reduce harmful terpenes?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There are reports that terpenes in coffee made without a paper filter raise cholesterol and risk of atherosclerosis / heart disease. (See &lt;a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6242467/ns/health-heart_health/t/coffee-cholesterol/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Coffee and Cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.coffees.com/blog/warning-going-to-the-coffee-shop-can-raise-your-cholesterol-level" rel="nofollow"&gt;Warning: Going to the Coffee Shop Can Raise Your Cholesterol Level&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like paper-filtered coffee, but I like french-pressed a lot better. I'm also starting to like moka-pot coffee. Now I'm concerned that those preferences may be increasing my risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I can control is the darkness and freshness of the roast I use. After watching the TED Talk, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaQNy0Ef4YY" rel="nofollow"&gt;what you didn't know about coffee&lt;/a&gt;, I've started freshly-roasting my own coffee, which allows me to control a couple of variables that may affect terpenes. In contrast, people who buy coffee from a store may not have as much control as I do over these variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I would like to know is whether the roast level or the age of roasted coffee affects the level of terpenes. Can I reduce terpene levels by roasting lighter or darker? Can I reduce terpene levels by waiting longer before using my roasted coffee or using it sooner?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Terpenes are the lipids (oils) that give the main flavor to your cup. Therefore, you don't want to reduce them normally. However, if you really want to reduce them, best choice is, as stated thick filtered drip machines. (One can be seen in this post: &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1535/coffee-in-breaking-bad"&gt;Coffee in Breaking Bad&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another brewing methodology that may be used is Turkish coffee. As coffee is heated from room temperature to near boiling points, you have (somehow) control over which lipids will evaporate during the process. You may modify the triple heating cycle of the Turkish coffee brewing to a single heating near or a bit over boiling point. (See this answer: &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2384/triple-heating-of-the-turkish-coffee/2392#2392"&gt;Triple heating of the Turkish coffee&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Speed of the plunger does not affect the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When coffee is brewed in a french press, the main parameters are (apart from the coffee itself)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the temperature of the water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the duration of brewing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the water quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, speed of plunger may be important in this case: if you push the plunger rapidly, the flow of water push the grounds from the sides of the filter. Thus, the grounds will probably mix with the final cup of coffee. Even worse, the hot water may splash in your hand or face.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Different-tasting coffee in Vietnam/Cambodia</title>

  <body>&lt;p&gt;We got in the office some kind of coffee-machine, I think it's &lt;em&gt;Moccamaster CD Thermo&lt;/em&gt;, and it has 2 thermoses, to keep a coffee warm/fresh for certain period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thermoses are good and easy to use. I think they do great job in terms of electricity economy... But does it really good for a coffee quality? According to the specs, they say, it's keeping temperatures between 80°-85° and &lt;strong&gt;meeting the requirements of the ECBC/SCAE/SCAA, what does it really mean&lt;/strong&gt;? It may be there are facts, which I haven't found, rather than too broad explanations, or opinion based thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand, that caffeine is not burning at temperature coffee is left at, and it does not evaporate. But &lt;strong&gt;for how long it's acceptable to keep coffee in thermoses, without loosing the taste/smell and quality of coffee&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kaffe.no" rel="nofollow"&gt;ECBC&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="http://scae.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;SCAE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scaa.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;SCAA&lt;/a&gt; are organizations that are specialized in Coffee. They organize many events like contests. Sometimes these contests are held for people sometimes for equipment. They also produce many reports on Coffee; from taste of a cup to cultivation politics. So, these organizations also have a certification procedure for coffee brewing machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the question, I understand that you want to keep the brewed filtered coffee in the carafe for a while and you are asking for the maximum allowed time for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is; the machine will try to keep the coffee intact &lt;strong&gt;as long as it can&lt;/strong&gt;; however, at that temperature the water will eventually vaporize and the rest of your coffee will turn into a bitter, dark, burnt coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply, your coffee will eventually die as living beings and your high-quality gadget may just slow this, but cannot stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution: Just taste it. Fresh filtered coffee always tastes better. According to my experience, first half hour is the tasty period.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's the recommended way to roast coffee beans at home?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There are couple of different methods to roast beans at home. Namely;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a specific home roaster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a pan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a hair dryer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a (sometimes modified) corn popper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;are alternatives I have heard of. I know that using heated air is advantageous as all beans are homogeneously roast. So, using a pan requires too much attention among these methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Do you know any other methods? Do you think one of these methods are superior to others?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The best would be buying a home roaster, but that would be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;corn popper does an amazing job considering how cheap and easy it is.
(hair drying is like corn popper in principle, but will need you to manually make sure the heat is used evenly, corn popper just do it automatically)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a pan need some practice but could be lot of fun to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you have the money and want to invest in it go for home roaster if not popcorn popper would be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;just remember, you cannot make a good coffee out of bad quality coffee beans while the opposite is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a Good Roasting :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Cafe latte with 0% fat milk?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to order cafe latte with 0% fat milk? Or most places would say that is not latte etc&lt;br&gt;
Would the taste be bad?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Cafe Latte comes in many variants, all of which are Cafe Lattes. If you ever see anyone ordering a "Cafe Latte with nonfat milk" at Starbucks, this typically refers to a Cafe Latte with milk that has less than 0.5% of fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that 0.0% fat milk is not available everywhere. For example, it is common in central Europe that the lowest percentage of fat available for milk is 0.3% or 1.5%. I recently checked at a German Starbucks what milk they have to pour into filter coffee, and they start at 1.5% fat. Note that even if the label on a box of milk says 0% fat, there will always be some traces of fat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it tastes well: that is subjective. Fat &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; add to the taste. But a 0.3% fat milk Cafe Latte is probably closer to a 1.5% fat milk Cafe Latte in terms of taste than to a coconut milk Cafe Latte, which is also enjoyed by many coffee consumers and also bears the name "Cafe Latte". Whether you will actually be able to get a close-to-0% fat Cafe Latte depends on the place that you are visiting: not all coffee places may have that type of milk in stock.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Convenient espresso shot container?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My friend recently gifted me a Breville ESP8XL. I'm looking for a convenient sealed (portable) container to carry (up to 3) espresso shots to work for the post-lunch slump. I couldn't find anything on Amazon. Does anybody use something similar to this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A very small thermos may be the answer. Quality made 50 ml (~2 oz.) thermos could be enough for a double shot. I have checked and found a few with a Google search.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's the difference in between the red Bourbon and yellow Bourbon?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have ended up three different Bourbon varieties as beans; yellow, orange and red. Are they the same variety, just cultivated in different times of the maturity of the coffee cherries? Or, are they three separate varieties with separate cherry color when they are mature?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;They are different varieties (at least 2 of them, red &amp;amp; yellow)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;original&lt;/strong&gt; Bourbon was the Red. Founded in the Bourbon Island (now Réunion) near by 1790 aprox at carried it by the French to Africa and America (Brazil).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in 1930, a natural mutation of the (Red) Bourbon was found at Sao Paulo (Brazil). This one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.casabrasilcoffees.com/learn/cultivars/" rel="nofollow"&gt;"Is thought to be either a natural hybrid of Red Bourbon and Botucatu Yellow or a natural mutation of Red Bourbon"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orange, it's just another mutation. But I'm certain that is not a &lt;strong&gt;ripeness&lt;/strong&gt; matter, it's a mutation/evolution thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Trying to identify which chemical is responsible for a burned plastic taste in certain flavors</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I used to love hazelnut flavored coffee. One day though, I noticed it smelled and tasted like burned plastic.  I chalked it up to a bad batch, but it turned out, since that day, all (or all that I've tried, including ones that used to be fine) have that smell and taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured it was something in the artificial flavoring used for hazelnut since actual hazelnuts (raw and roasted) don't have that flavor nor odor to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I just tried a coconut mocha coffee they had at my office as it looked interesting and I smelled the same exact odor. I tasted it anyway, and got the exact same taste as well. There was nothing hazelnut about this coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I'm trying to figure out what exactly it is that I am perceiving as this smell/taste.  It's not actually hazelnuts and it's something that's in multiple flavored coffees, but definitely not all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not coffee itself, and it's not a flavor that's in every flavored coffee (black coffee, cinnamon bun, blueberry, pumpkin spice, so far have all been fine)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any idea at all what it could be that I'm tasting that way?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Being ill or recovering from being ill can certainly change your sense of taste. Can you get somebody else to try the coffee you get that smell/taste from to see if they also do? At least you can eliminate you or the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Can I have this type of coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I would like to know if people normally have the type of coffee I do. I take coffee from a vending machine that has a variety of options (latte, cappuccino, espresso) of which I choose espresso. This vends 60ml of espresso (people local to me call it 60ml of decoction). This looks dark brown in color. I usually have this as such but would sometimes add 200ml of hot water to this. I never add sugar or milk to this as I hate the sweetness it adds to my coffee. What is the name of the beverage that I'm having ? Is it recommended to have 60ml of espresso (without water, milk or sugar) twice a day ? Will this have large amounts of caffeine and is it going to have an adverse effect on my health ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never find anyone having this type of coffee, people local to me, usually add milk to their coffee. I feel weird, and everyone suggest this might be bad for health. Am I the only one around having this type of coffee everyday ?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The beverage you make by diluting vending machine "espresso" with hot water is called "poor imitation of Americano". It is hard to say how much caffeine it contains because it's not clear what this particular vending machine is filled with. It would also be wrong to speculate on its health effects without this knowledge and without knowing whether in general coffee is good for you. Unfortunately, there're many people around who drink such poor substitute of a good espresso made by a professional barista with a real espresso machine from good and fresh roasted beans.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is a good ratio for nitro cold brew that will not be diluted?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am looking to serve nitro cold brew on tap into clear glasses without dilution or ice. I've seen a good number of people share ratios for cold brew, but what would be a good place to start if I don't want to dilute the pour (and use nitro)? We prefer a strong flavor, but don't want it to be TOO strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm roughly looking at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~11oz coffee for 128oz (final ratio after diluting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached this number by looking at the numbers various commercial coffee makers have posted online. For example: Stumptown has a .214 ratio, but then recommends diluting with 2 parts water for ever 1 part concentrate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, my plan is to make a concentrate with 3.5lbs of coffee, and then top up to ~5 gallons (or less depending on taste).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone provide any recommendations from experience? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The two big numbers I use when brewing are ratio and time. With these set correctly, you can do batches from 1L to 25L and the only difference is how hard it is to drain/filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cold brew large batches to keg with nitro and also drink it straight and here are a few notes I have about my two numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Time:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time range everyone says is 12h-24h. I think this is about right and I think the sweet spot for normal brews is about 16h at room temperature. Closer to 24 hours can often taste "over extracted" and will be more bitter, but also more caffeinated. If you're trying to brew stronger, I'd try keeping your ratio the same and adjusting time to see what you want the brew to taste like first. Higher ratio brews seem to also benefit from longer steep times as solubility can become a factor, so usually if I like a coffee at 0.125 ratio for 14 hours and I go to make a 0.200 ratio brew, I'll steep it for 15-16 hours instead to make sure I can dilute it down to how I like it. This is where things tend to be by "feel".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ratio&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ratio is much more scientific. It's just how much water and how much ground coffee you use. Protip: Use metric units and measure your ratio as Kg coffee : L water. This makes life way easier since you don't buy water by weight, but 1 Kg of water = 1 L of water, so your ratio makes sense. Here are the ratios I regularly use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.100&lt;/strong&gt;: "Beginner" Nitro cold brew. If you want to serve a keg of cold brew and nitrogenate it, but your audience is family or non-coffee enthusiasts, this is a good ratio so that people don't chug a cup of it and feel like their eyes are going to pop out from the caffeine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.110&lt;/strong&gt;: "The book" cold brew: loads of people swear by "1 gallon of water per 1lb of coffee" ratio. That's 0.110. I rarely use it, but here it is for reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.166&lt;/strong&gt;: Flat, everyday cold brew, fresh. I frequently make fresh cold brew overnight for myself. When I wake up it's room temperature and when it drips through a filter, it has a pleasant CO2 frothiness to it. I drink this over ice, which dilutes it close to 0.125 and if there are leftovers, I'll store them in the fridge and drink them straight later. It's a good ratio if you're not planning anything and want it to be flexible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.185&lt;/strong&gt;: Strong. When I make nitro for enthusiasts, I brew here. This is a really rich, strong flavor. The creaminess of the nitrogen makes up for the fact that it's not diluted. Make no mistake, this is very strong to drink straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.200&lt;/strong&gt;: Concentrate for 1:1 dilution. I don't typically do water dilution. I rarely brew here, but this concentrate could work with a mix of ice and condensed milk or just cold cream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.250&lt;/strong&gt;: Strong concentrate for 1:1 or higher dilution. If I make concentrate, I make it at this ratio for 16h+. Again, I don't do water dilutions, but over ice and cream or condensed milk, this can really make a good coffee flavored beverage or save space for storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I like Ethiopian beans for flat cold brew. I've tried several beans for Nitro and not had one I didn't like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why some coffee pods are under pressure?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am quite sure that air prejudices the quality of the coffee. So why some coffee pods are under pressure? Shouldn't they be in vacuum?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Inert gases are known to be chemically stable; they don't react with materials around. Based on that fact Ernesto Illy, the son of the founder of the famous coffee roasting company, invented the method of filling a can of roasted coffee beans with pressurized inert gases. Many years they held the patent for this method and still pressurized roasted coffee cans are the fingerprint for that company. This method is known to protect the roasted beans for a longer period; however it's not magical. So, the beans will stale eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Water Filtration for Cold Brew Vending</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am going to begin vending cold brew at parties/pop-up events with the Toddy process, what are good methods to assure that I have optimal water quality with as little overhead as possible?  I will brew between 12-18 gallons of cold brew for 350-400 people.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I typically buy the giant water jugs that they use for office water coolers. They sell them at nearly all grocery stores and compared to coffee, it's pretty inexpensive. I'd say if it starts taking you more than 20 minutes to move the water by hand, then congratulations on your success, and it's time to buy a filter. If you filter, you'll have the overhead of maintaining the filter and ensuring whatever water supply you have is being filtered well enough, but until then -- just buy it from higher end drinking water sources in large jugs or bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Messy grounds inside of DeLonghi ESAM 2600</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've got a DeLonghi bean-to-cup machine (&lt;a href="http://www.delonghi.com/en-int/products/coffee/coffee-makers/bean-to-cup/caffe-corso-esam-2600-0132212096" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ESAM 2600&lt;/a&gt;), which I find decent in overall. But there is one very annoying issue: not all of the grounds make it from the basket into the internal waste bin. Instead, some of them get scattered over the insides and add extra pain to the cleaning procedure. I feel like this misbehaviour first became noticable with age (can't say exactly, but roughly past the third year of its life), and kept slowly worsening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't seem to find much discussion of the problem. Does anyone know about this machine or bean-to-cups more generally, why they'd do it and whether there's a fix?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>General inquiries of cold brew</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of cold brew and I'm planning to start up my own business, so I'm wondering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What other equipment can I use instead of toddy commercial?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which coffee origin will give a dark chocolate and spices flavor?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you calculate the ratio of water to coffee, say if I want to produce 10 litres of cold brew?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is 12 hours the optimal peak?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I mainly used Toddy and other full immersion techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the place I work we just use the Toddy. For big batches it is in my opinion the best alternative. We have a drip stand (Hario or some other fancy wooden thing) as well, but it's just not as good, because the water is dripping on the same spot of coffee grounds constantly. You can mitigate that by placing a round paper filter on the grounds (from Aeropress e.g.), however there will still be some uneven extraction. An alternative is the Filtron system, which is basically the same thing. What you could do as well is just brew it in big jars or barrels and then filter it in 3 levels with a restrainer, cheese cloth and coffee filters.
&lt;a href="https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/blog/cold-brewer-roundup/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here is&lt;/a&gt; a nice little comparison by Stumptown coffee, that places the Filtron and Toddy system on the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, cold brew works best with washed Ethiopian/Kenian light roasted coffees in my opinion, which really brings out a lot of sweetness and a nice floral flavor. Cold brew generally reduces acidity, so it works well with high acidity (african) coffees. Sumatran coffees, which would match your flavor requests, are already very low in acidity so the cold brew method can't really shine here. You can also try natural processed african coffees, they would be more full bodied, chocolaty and with notes of red berries (had an amazing ethiopian natural that tasted incredibly like strawberries). They are not really my thing though, a bit flavor overkill most of the times.
Central American coffees usually work quite well as well, with a bit more nutty, caramel and chocolaty flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've written something on this &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3064/what-are-good-methods-to-prepare-and-vend-cold-brew/3185#3185"&gt;in this question&lt;/a&gt; already. In any case I use very high coffee to water ratios and don't dilute the concentrate (just served on a lot if ice). However for many people that is too strong and they dilute it with water or even add a little milk, which works quite well with this kind of concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depends on your taste and the best recommendation anyone can give you here is to try a lot of different coffees and recipes until you find your style. You should definitely do some testing before you sell, so you actually like what you are selling and understand what it is. Generally longer contact time means higher extraction, 12 to 14 hours is what I do at home (in a mason jar) and I like it most. In the shop we do faster brews though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I hope that helped, I'm happy about comments and suggestions how to improve the post.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the right coffee ground size for an espresso coffee machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have an espresso coffee machine. When I use very fine pure coffee powder, it seems the water fails to pass through and when I use a coarsely ground powder, the extract is too light. Should I be mixing chicory with the pure coffee powder?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Practically speaking, an arbitrary number can only get you so far. What you need to focus on is what we would call 'dialling in'. This is a term to describe the process by which we find the most suitable parameters for making the 'best' cup of coffee. 'Dialling in' can mean a multitude of things but in your case it will simply refer to finding the right grind size and/or dosage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem you seem to have is directly because you are shooting far above and below the the 'right' grind size assuming that you are using the exact same mass of coffee every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the right grind size, you must have a decent enough grinder that grinds to a uniform level and can be adjusted to a high degree, you should only be adjusting in small amounts. If you do not have a grinder, it will be very hard if not impossible to find a pre-ground bag that works perfectly for you. If you are choking the machine because the particle size is too small, adjust coarser gradually and keep making shots to observe the change in extraction times and flavours. If you are extracting very fast and water is rushing out causing under-extraction, adjust finer. Repeat until you achieve the 'best' flavour you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, if your coffee still tastes off then your problem may lie in your dosage. You may be using too much or too little coffee causing hindrance to a uniform extraction. Once again, simply adjusting your dosage above and below your current amount in small increments will help you find the spot where the extraction performs the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your coffee still tastes off you may be having temperature stability issues, water quality issues, coffee freshness issues, unstable brew-head pressure issues, poor basket distribution and tamping or any combination of the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 'right' grind size for espresso, or any brew method for that matter, is never the same and is dependent on, at the very least, the coffee bean itself which is still a variable even if brewing from the same bag, finding the 'right' grind size is always going to be a chase and 'dialling in' will be an exercise you will almost always have to do if you want the best coffee you can extract from what you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/3255/1702"&gt;MT San's answer&lt;/a&gt; provides a link to a more generic explanation and reference to the different general grind sizes for the different brew methods if you are completely in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Butter coffee taste and effects?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have heard of people putting grass fed unsalted butter in their coffee and I have heard its pretty good. I was wondering if anyone has tried it and would like to describe the taste and how effective it was.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I do not know if this will be a good answer for you but here it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I lived in France (small rural community), I used to put grass fed unsalted butter into my coffee all the time. I got the idea from reading articles about Tibetans putting &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter_tea" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;yak butter into their black tea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I enjoy it. It is an acquired taste because it is has a very rich and heavy flavor. Do not put milk or cream into your coffee as it will completely change your perspective on this great coffee idea. For myself, I prefer not to drink it just as it, safe the bottom of the barrel sort of speaking. I generally would dunk my rather dense bread (sometimes biscuits) into it at breakfast time and have enjoyed doing this as such for many years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For myself I only do this in the mornings.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coffee Cantata is also known as "Schweigt stille, plaudert nicht (Be still, stop chattering) or BWV 211.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is composed around 1732-1735 by Bach in Leipzig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is known as a cantata, but actually it has a story and looks like a mini opera. In the opera, the father tries to stop her daughter from drinking coffee. However, the daughter loves coffee and sings nice lyrical praises to coffee. A well-known sentence is this: &lt;em&gt;"If I couldn't, three times a day, be allowed to drink my little cup of coffee, in my anguish I will turn into a shriveled-up roast goat".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schweigt_stille,_plaudert_nicht,_BWV_211" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;More info on history of the cantata can be found on its Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>After cleaning a bean to cup machine can I reinsert the same filter?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The Melitta Caffeo Gourmet bean to cup machine has built in cleaning and rescaling programmes. During these it is necessary to remove the Claris water filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I put the same filter back in? Or do I need to use a new one? Should I tell the machine via the care menu that I am removing/inserting the filter? Or just take it out without selecting remove or insert filter from that menu so it can remember how old the filter is?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I don't know the machine you're using but it seems like the water filters have a lifetime counted in water litters so you don't have to change it everytime , just when it filtered the amount of water it's designed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you should try at least once to tell the machine you're removing the filter to see if it remembers how old the filter is but you should probably wait to be near to your filter end to do so because if it doesn't remember how old it is you can just change it for a new one. But you should try to tell the machine , you'd rather loose a filter than bug your machine !&lt;/p&gt;

Is it implied that I would fill the water line and pour into the base twice to achieve a 2 cup espresso? Won't this throw the whole ratio of water to heat to time ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any insight is greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The Bialetti two Cup stove top produces 100ml of coffee. That is in fact much more than two average espressos. A double shot pulled from an espresso machine would have between 40ml and 60ml.
Your Brikka should thus produce roughly two double shots of espresso. Well it is not actually espresso, but that's a whole different topic.
As far as I know there is only one "marker", which is actually the pressure valve. You should fill the water slightly below the valve. Then you'll get the 100ml.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee machine repair</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I own a Delonghi Magnifica ESAM 3300:&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5wkSv.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5wkSv.jpg" alt="Delongi MAGNIFICA ESAM 3300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has served me fine but it is like 10 years old.  It has broken three times and twice I have been able to fix it myself (fittings).  It is like $130 to just have it looked at and no guarantee it can be fixed (for less than the cost of a new machine).  Given the age I am reluctant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it is turned on the motor engages to move the grinder for a few seconds and then just moves it back (to the bottom position).  An electrical type override as I took it apart and there is no mechanical obstruction.  When I had to send it in before for the exact same symptom they told me yes that is a start up check that failed.  Same symptoms does not mean same failure but I was not charged for parts before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only place I can find a service manual is a Russian domain.  I do computing for a living and the link to it is a script.  I know not to click it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice on how to fix this or how to get a service manual?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'd start by contacting their &lt;a href="http://www.delonghi.com/en-us/customer-service" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;customer support&lt;/a&gt; for a service manual and for tips on this particular problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key idea in debugging (diagnosing) is to think of hypotheses that could explain it, and ways to test those hypotheses, then do the tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. for this symptom, my first hypothesis is that there's a switch or optical sensor or other sensor to protect the mechanism, and the sensor could be clogged or covered with gunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's good to think of multiple hypotheses and tests to distinguish between them. So here's another: The mechanism itself could be clogged with gunk, and after detecting too much load or force, the control software backs off for protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A test for both of these hypotheses is to open the machine and clean the works. The difference between the two hypotheses is whether it's the sensor or the mechanism that needs cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service manual would help with hypothesis generation and testing. What start up checks does it do? What &amp;amp; where are the sensors? What parts need to work properly for the grinder engagement mechanism to work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another hypothesis: The mechanism needs lubrication. The service manual should indicate what to lubricate, what not to lubricate, and what lube to use. Or you could guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another hypothesis is a rubber O-ring has worn out or broken. This is also consistent with what you've written, i.e. your existing experience can rule out some hypotheses. It can also make other hypotheses less likely, e.g. if the cause is the same as last time (not a sure bet), a burned out motor would've cost you for parts, while a worn out O-ring might not have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also: There are local and online repair clinics to help with appliance repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's worth trying. In the worst case, you spend some time and learn something.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>French-press v.s. manual pour over brewing quality</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Does anyone happen to know the differences in brewing quality of using a french press v.s. using a manual pour over? I can imagine using filter paper might give a better quality brew with a manual pour over than with the french press' metal mesh filter but I could be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;First things first, let's put the difference between French press and manual pour-over:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;French-press&lt;/strong&gt;: Coffee and water stay in the same container during brewing. The water is not very close to boiling temperatures. You wait for a while to brew it. At the end, the output is coffee with some fine residue of coffee ground in it. This may continue to brew while you drink. So, it must be consumed fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual pour-over&lt;/strong&gt;: Coffee and water are in two different compartments. (This is a very definitive difference.) Brewing happens fast, with close to boiling temperatures. The output has no visible grounds in it. You may wait for a while till it gets colder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, the answer... How could we define the quality? I think it depends on the drinker's mood. I change my brewing method from day to day. I drink cold brew for a while, then two shots of espresso, then a Turkish. I never thought one of them has superior quality.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Instant coffee to powdered milk ratio?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm going backpacking in a few weekends, and in order to save on pack weight I've been dehydrating a lot of my meals. As I think about breakfast, I'm settling on carrying only powdered milk and instant coffee for my breakfast cup of joe. I was wondering if anyone has done this and what a good instant coffee to hot water to powdered milk ratio would be. What would the steps for making it look like? Would I add the powdered milk first or the coffee first, or both at the same time? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As a disclaimer, I've never done this, but here's the way I would do it if I were you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, determine how you like your coffee when its a regular cup of joe.  Once you know how much milk you use to however much coffee, determine how much powdered milk reconstitutes to the equivalent amount of regular milk.  Then determine how much instant coffee in a glass of hot water makes a comparably sized cup of regular black coffee.  When you've done that, you should have measurements for how much instant coffee and how much powdered milk you need for one cup of coffee.  (Be sure to make a test cup!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then for ease of use on the trail I would scale up the amounts based on how long of a trip and how many cups of coffee you think you'll want and combine the coffee and milk powders.  Thoroughly mixed, they can be stored in a single container, and since you know how much instant coffee and how much powdered milk to use separately in a given amount of hot water, you can add those amounts to know how much of the mix to put in your cup on the trail.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would do powder mix first, then hot water, and stir to combine/dissolve completely.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Getting the sound of really good micro bubbles</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have heard that the perfect sound while steaming milk should sound like paper ripping, but I have seen a lot more talented people making a decent coffee with good micro bubbles without that sound.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a "perfect sound" to know that you are getting the best micro bubbles?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The sound it's not a very good "measure stick" for steaming. That is because it would depend on the steaming wand (how many steam holes has, how much steam the machine produces, etc), the pitcher (the form of it affects in how the milk moves inside), the milk (yes, whole-milk vs almond are very different), etc...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I suggest to you that don't focus on other's people &lt;em&gt;steaming sound&lt;/em&gt;, but instead on theirs technique. Of course there are some sounds that indicates some process (the first sound it's very loud, until the milk circulates enough), but there aren't a sufficient parameters (on my POV).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/3409/825"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; related answer. Hope it's helpful.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it possible to make instant coffee of varying roasts?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've never seen instant coffees being sold consisting of varying roasts (i.e. light/mild, medium, dark etc.) does such a thing exist? Or is there a reason why they haven't been tried?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There is no reason why instant coffee couldn't be roasted differently. It's made from real coffee beans after they have been roasted and ground. Instant coffee is just &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-is-instant-coffee_us_57bda1ebe4b00d9c3a1afc74" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;dehydrated coffee&lt;/a&gt; basically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the reason you have never seen different roasts types is because instant coffee is made more for convenience. It's supposed to be quick, easy coffee. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/07/14/almost-half-of-the-world-actually-prefers-instant-coffee/?utm_term=.1d91b6639ba4" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;It's made for the "Amateur coffee drinker"&lt;/a&gt;(If there is such a thing). For that reason those purchasing the coffee probably don't care much about how it will taste and therefor care very little about the roast type.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to dismantle La Scala E61 group shower</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a hard time dismantling the group shower of a La Scala Butterfly. The main problem is, that there is —as I have seen so far on other machines— any visible screw nut on the bottom of the sieve. It is stuck, does not turn, even by force using a pipe wrench.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KZSVY.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KZSVY.jpg" alt="La Scala E61 groups shower"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;After thinking about this for days, reading every repair or rebuild history I could find in the internet, I realized that there is one more possibility. The sieve is mounted bottom facing and as it is an exposed part, facing a lot of shaking on the most outer edge (and as the La Scala engineers have shown some engineering details that already impressed me), it could be that the thread is milled counter clockwise. &lt;strike&gt;And yes, &lt;em&gt;it is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;em&gt;Edit, which I forgot: It just stuck due to the massive amount of old coffee.

  <title>Kopi Luwak coffee beans</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Kopi Luwak are the most expensive coffee beans, but I was wondering if there is a special taste to these coffee beans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also wondering if there is  a recommended method of brewing which would harness the flavor of the coffee beans?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I would get the beans, how should I prepare my equipment? I am using an espresso machine. Should I clean the machine extra well? How about the grinder?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Each coffee has it's own special taste and distinctive flavours. Whether it is pre-ground Maxwell House or small-batch roasted single origin, there will be different flavour profiles and smells. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "quality" of coffee is mostly determined by the bitterness and taste. Fresh, great quality coffee is often bright and has complex flavours that fill your palette. Diner coffee is usually bland and more bitter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high-quality beans, the enjoyment of the coffee is then more down to personal taste. That is, whether someone likes a bright, almost tea-like single origin from Ethiopia, or a deep-bodied Sumatran coffee with herbal notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Kopi Luwak coffee will certainly have it's own distinctive taste, that's for sure. Will it taste better than cheap coffee like Maxwell house? Yes, probably. Will it be the best coffee you've ever had? Maybe not, and that is just fine. People drink this coffee because it is rare and sought after, not neccesarily because they are looking for the best cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for brewing it, I would suggest trying it a number of ways, because each brewing method brings out different flavour profiles. French press will allow you to experience the body that is likely from a South-east asian coffee and will allow the natural oils onto your palette. Pour-over will take away some of that body but accentuate the herbal tones and bring out the top-end in terms of flavours. Espresso is always interesting, and the concentrated method could yield some surprising flavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have the means to try it, I would. It's a neat experience and if you are keen on coffee, tasting more coffee, no matter where its from, is always a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for cleaning your equipment, just make sure to do a regular cleaning of your espresso machine/french press to remove any residue. This doesn't have to be intensive, just make sure there are no leftover grounds. For you grinder, I would disassemble as much as possible and wash and dry the parts. Grinders always retain a decent amount of grounds, and those mixing in with the expensive Kopi Luwat could change the flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are three videos where people try this coffee:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/dk8_HabWkW0" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Tested&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Environmental/human ethics of common brands</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I currently try to purchase fair trade coffee, since it at least comes with a policy of attempting to be...well...fair to the producers.  However, just because a coffee is not fair trade doesn't mean that it isn't fair, and there are some coffee plantations that I've heard of that do better than the fair trade standard but don't go for the official certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any brands that are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. cheaper than fair trade
b. as ethical/better from both a human and environment standard?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The major standards are a bit confusing honestly.  Fair trade provides a baseline above the commodities rates, but they don't ensure that the farmer is getting the most for their product.  Furthermore, the farm has to be able to be certified for conforming to certain environmental conditions prior to being certified.  Many coffee farmers are so far off the beaten path that they simply cannot afford to be certified.  I believe that conscientious importers provide a far better compensation to the farmer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like Fair Trade assures something between 15 and 35 cents above commodities rates.  This is far below what a roaster will pay for specialty grade coffee.  While fair trade is a good baseline, if you purchase specialty coffee, you are most likely buying coffee that was purchased for significantly better than fair trade rates.  To give you an idea.. I pulled up a random invoice I had in my inbox and it was $1.70 above commodities rate.  Furthermore, importers provide on the ground support to farmers in the form of varietal education and recommendations, disease prevention, washing technique improvements, all of which net the farmer tangible benefits because their coffee will improve in quality, and thus, sell for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So.. if you are looking for good ethical compensation for farmers, I would say look for local specialty roasteries.  These roasteries are purchasing high quality coffee from a high quality importer which means that there are people on the ground helping farmers achieve better quality, and thus better compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link below is a pretty interesting article from a greens buyer I am thinking about working with.  I found it a very interesting read that gave some insight into what importers actually do, and highlights why a lot of coffee farms are not certified.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.perfectdailygrind.com/2017/04/40-hours-life-colombian-green-bean-buyer/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;40 hours in the life of a greens buyer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this explanation doesn't directly answer your question, but hopefully it sheds some light on the behind the scenes of how coffee buying works.  Fair Trade, Organic, Rainforest Alliance are all great programs, but they can also exclude a lot of hard working farmers, that produce fantastic products, and are very conscientious of the environment etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last bit of food for thought.. My roastery cannot advertise our product as Organic because our kitchen is not certified Organic (I've been officially open only for a few months, after a years worth of building my business and haven't been able to get certification lined up yet).  Despite this, half of my products are certified Organic.  Looking at it from the business perspective, I would love to advertise my product as Organic, but just haven't been able to navigate the red tape, and I am sure there are other small businesses that are in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>thread locker / sealant for espresso machine maintenance</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have started disassembling my Nuova Simonelli Oscar, for descaling and fixing purposes, I have checked all the electrical section and I am about to start with the hydraulics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen that all threads are fully locked and sealed with some hard material, I assume I will have to place it back reassembling it. What kind of thread locker / thread sealer / gasket sealer / gasket replacement is that? can I use any that will sustain high temps or it has to be food safe?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You can use pretty much every kind of drinking water sealant that you would use in home installations. You DIY–/ Homework–market (I do not know the English word), normally has such stuff. Just make sure it meets three requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For drinking water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be used with boiling, hot water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; harden over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; number one choice. I personally used &lt;em&gt;plastic–fermit&lt;/em&gt; (which is used for home hat water drainages) with success. I do not even need tools to lock down threads, all are just tightened by hand and it opens easily again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually the manufacturers use something that I would recommend to avoid like the devil the water: PTFE/ Teflon. This locks things down forever. One winding too much and you will break your thread when trying to open it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; As grease, I can recommend to use silicone. The thing I used on my current machine is by &lt;em&gt;fermit&lt;/em&gt; again. If it does not get in contact with water, I would recommend using copper paste (for e.g. by Liqui Moly), which can be used up to 1.4k°C. You will need the grease only for the steam wand and hot water outlet. If you are unsure what to buy, search for (German/ DE) &lt;em&gt;Amaturenfett&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Hahnfett&lt;/em&gt;, which is safe for hot potable water and is used for bathroom fittings and similar.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A couple useful posts found in a thread linked below.  Text below is two user posts.  LeeWardles post seems to have been accepted by the original poster as being correct information, but you can check out the whole thread below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;awlred posted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have an MC2 and recently pulled it out after my newer grinder
  breaking down. You can pop the top bit off the grinder (The black
  plastic part) and unscrew the worm-drive mounting. Doing this makes it
  very easy to get access to the top burr plate and unscrew it until it
  comes away. After that use a stiff bristled toothbrush or small
  paintbrush to remove all the ground coffee etc and clean the housing
  out entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Assembly is the opposite of dismantling. As a rule of thumb I tighten
  until the burrs meet (the lower burr moves with the upper) and then
  loosen off about 1/8th of a full turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Point to note The wormdrive, while being annoyingly slow to adjust
  needs to be in place for the grinder to remain dialed at any setting.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;While on the subject, an easy hack to make adjustments quicker is a
  set of locking pliers (welders pliers) either around the knob or
  straight on the bar. Which makes the whole process a LOT quicker, if
  slightly less elegant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LeeWardle posted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;just needs a strip down. From what you have said it sounds like the
  grind is set to course (after you wound it back) so the noise is bean
  fragments. Also could be that one if the screws has come loose so the
  blde is loose on its mount. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Hold the button down that holds the step ring and unscrew the ring.
  This will leave you with the plastic ring and an cast alu mount for
  the top blade. Use a wire brush and clean this blade. Remove it and
  clean the mount, put it back. Next remove the lower blade. To do this
  safely unplug from the mains. To stop the motor turning while you
  unscrew place a large flat blade driver next to one of the fins. Clean
  it all and put it all back together. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Next set the grind to the right courseness. Dose a little onto your
  hand and rub the grouds with your figer. The grouds should be uniform.
  If not you need new blades. These shouldnt cost you anymore than
  £15-20. Makesure you get the right blades as some are right handed &amp;amp;
  some are left. Don't forget, this grinder is made by Cunill and
  re-badged iberital so you can get blades from anyone. If your having
  trouble sourcing new blades leave your number and i'll get a supplier
  to ring you ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does aeropress coffee change flavour after several hours?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Every morning I make coffee with aeropress, fresh bean grounded with automatic burr grinder. When it is working day I would put it into a warm bottle and drink in office. I would arrive at office and drink the coffee around two hours. When it is holiday I would drink it immediately at home. Somehow I think the coffee taste not as good when I drink it in office. The coffee would have less acidity and a little more bitterness. I use a zojirushi warm bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;All coffee changes taste over time - it is full of relatively fragile organic compounds that will change over time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in a vacuum flask (without exposure to light), the coffee will keep chemically reacting with itself. There is also oxygen in the bottle which will aid the breakdown of various of the compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There really is no way to perfectly preserve the taste of fresh coffee unfortunately!&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If the concern is solely production of great espresso, I would argue that the 'skillset' required actually consists of a single point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Palate. Being able to discern flavours and work out what is good and bad about any shot is essential in being able to improve your espresso.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a skill that you'll need to train and perfect but is the only necessary ability in making good espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real bulk of what makes espresso great is simply being able to control the factors and variables in making it which requires an ability to taste what is wrong with any given shot. I wouldn't say the specific factors that contribute to good espresso are skills (as skills are traits of the barista), but are simply parameters that is up to you to modify and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parameters you need to keep in mind when making espresso are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freshness of coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grind size of coffee particle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water quality and composition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brew temperature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brew pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee distribution in portafilter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amount of coffee used per shot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length of shot/Amount of water pulled/Final output volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tamp level and pressure are things that affect the shot but aren't exactly variables you would change. These would just be things you would aim to get 'right' every time. 'Right' here means ensuring a level, horizontal bed of coffee and a consistent tamp pressure. Tamp pressure is easier to normalise than it sounds; tamp until the coffee bed stops compressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the above will be down to the grinder and espresso machines chosen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a bottomless portafilter enables a clear view of the exit of the shot which serves as an invaluable tool in recognising uneven extractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never tap/knock the portafilter after tamping. This completely destroys puck uniformity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a distribution tool to help evenly distribute coffee in your portafilter. Use a pin with the Weiss Distribution Technique or a Pullman Chisel/OCD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VST baskets are replacement baskets for your portafilter with filter holes positioned and sized to aid uniform extractions. Would recommend getting one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grind uniformity is also a thing to keep in mind. Higher quality grinders will result in a lower deviation in particle sizes of the resulting coffee grounds. Lower deviation means more consistency in extraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a scale and a timer to weigh and time your shots. You will need to know what you did in order to know how to improve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When chasing a good shot, change one variable in your method at a time. If you change multiple, you will never know what contributed to making your shot great.&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Website or database to find local coffee beans</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm having a problem finding places that sell bulk coffee beans (other than one grocery store selling stale beans). Is there a website somewhere that keeps track or a place I can go to ask? I live in a metropolitan area in a county west of Cleveland. I can find places that sell beans, but they seem to be one county over and a pretty decent drive away from me. I brew up small batches and I want to go into a place and buy a handful of beans at a time to try. There use to be two coffee house chains in the area, but they stopped selling beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not want to mail order beans. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There isn't a website or database really that keeps track of this.  Use google to search 'coffee roastery near me' or something similar.  Look up local coffee shops (non chain shops) and ask them where they get their beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't completely exclude mail order!!  I am based in Broken Arrow, OK but we roast our beans to order and so if you were to order coffee from my company, you would have it in your hands maybe 4-5 days after roasting which very well could be better than you might get at a local roastery.  We pride ourselves on freshness and quality so will throw away or donate coffee that has sat on the shelf for any appreciable period of time.  I am sure that we are not the only company that is this dedicated to freshness.  In addition, most roasterys have to give some sort of free shipping in order to compete in the online market space so depending on the size of your order, it very well may not cost more per pound than a local roastery.  My profile should have a link to my website if you are so inclined as to take a look around.  I typically don't link, but figured it is a direct solution to the question so it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last little thought.. my company started with me being in a very similar situation to you.  I wanted fresh premium coffee, and wanted to try a lot of different options.  This led me to home roasting.  This may be another option for you, but it is definitely a time and money commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Do ground beans or brewed coffee lose flavour faster?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I usually roast my coffee in the evening, grind it and brew it in the morning, to drink multiple hours later. I do notice that I do not have the same experience drinking coffee multiple hours after it has been brewed and kept in a thermos, despite me pouring it into a mug as usual. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been wondering recently if I should get a french press mug, which will keep the coffee grounds, and when I want to drink, I could add hot water to brew it on the spot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, however, that ground coffee loses its flavour very quickly (I've heard people say that 15 minutes is enough for a tastable change in flavour). So this makes me wonder, is there a difference in how well flavour can be conserved in either ground coffee or brewed coffee? Does sealing either one in a thermos change this outcome?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In the scenario given, you don't have the prefect solution to drink fresh coffee. However, I would opt for carrying a brewing solution (French-press in your case) with me. Let's discuss the two cases separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Early-brewing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that case, you can grind fresh beans and prepare your coffee optimally with the brewing method of your preference. However, you cannot protect the brewed cup of coffee to go 'bad'. The reason is, whatever you do, you leave tiny coffee grounds in the water and they continue the extraction process. By time, your coffee gets bitter as a result of over-extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, this is a problem even in our daily routine. Pour-over brewing methods are invented for that. We mostly use paper filters to filter out most of the tiny grounds and have a clean cup to get rid of continuing extraction. Thus, we can have a stable cup while we drink in the next five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow your taste buds, you can clearly feel this in a Turkish coffee cup or French-press, as most of the tiny grounds are still in the final cup in a French-press (and all of them are still there in a Turkish fincan) you should be quick to drink it. Otherwise, the cup goes crap. (By the way, inverted French-press is can also be used to minimize the effect of tiny grounds. But not effective enough.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Late-brewing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody on this board could admit that after grinding coffee goes stale in a few minutes. (See &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3715/how-quickly-does-coffee-get-stale"&gt;How quickly does coffee get stale?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you grind the beans, the surface area increases so the delicious aromatics evaporate more easily. You probably will end up with a duller coffee experience at the end. However, I feel like over-extraction is a far worse problem in your case.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Pressure changed overnight? (to high)</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Anybody has any idea what can make the pressure go up &lt;em&gt;overnight&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the normal 7,5, its now over 12 BAR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't changed anything. Just added some beans last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cleaned the machine, but it had no effect. I also tried less then 7 grams, and very light tamping. But the effect is minimal (still over 10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any clue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Running a Rocket R58 with a Compak F8 OD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked the pressure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;without porto-filter its 7 BAR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with the blind filter its 11 BAR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked the blind pressure with a friend (also a R58), thats 7.5 BAR.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As the machine is cleaned thoroughly, we can eliminate any kind of blockage. Then, a very probable reason for this is the thermostat. If it starts malfunctioning overnight (it is possible as they are electronic controllers with a thermocouple attached), then the machine may overheat your boiler. This ends up over-pressure. If possible, compare the temperature with normal temperature first.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What acids are there in coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I don't know what acids extract with what temperature. For example, in 93 °C what acids hurt and what acids extract. I want to know for better flavor and less bitterness in my espresso, what can I do?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Note:  I leave out a lot of the details of espresso shot extraction and just mention the major points of troubleshooting so don't flame me =p&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acidity is always tricky when you talk coffee because there are differences between perceived acidity and actual acidity.  Most coffees are slightly more acidic than milk, and they are in a very tight pH range.  When I talk to customers and try to describe acidity, I typically describe a spectrum where on one end, you have acidity, and the other end you have bitterness.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use identical beans, you will typically get the exact same amount of acids in your cup of coffee.  These acids are primarily Citric and Malic acids and they extract at relatively low temperatures compared to the other compounds in coffee which is to say, you can't use water temperature to change acid extraction without brewing at such a low temperature as to basically not brew coffee.  The caveat to that is cold brew methods which essentially trade heat for time and are known for being very low acidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You mention better flavor and less bitterness in your espresso.  This indicates to me that rather than being concerned about acid extraction, we need to look on the other end of the spectrum and look at over extraction.  If you think about a coffee ground like a sponge filled with flavors, the first thing to come out is the acids.  This is why when you brew weak coffee it is thin, and tastes acidic.  The longer you squeeze the sponge so to speak, the more compounds come out, the last being the melanoidins that contribute body to the coffee.  Just like too much acid in weak coffee, if you extract too much out of the ground you will start getting bitter flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing is determining if the flavor defect is in fact acidity, or bitterness.  The biggest identifier for me is if it is overbearing acidity, I can feel it on the sides of my tongue (that's the sour receptors).  If instead you are dealing with bitterness, or charry flavor that is going to require the exact opposite to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a post where I was troubleshooting a particularly difficult espresso shot that gives a lot of the detailed mechanics of how to pull a shot, and what might be going wrong.  &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3518/what-is-going-wrong-with-this-espresso-shot"&gt;Coffee SE Espresso Thread&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets say your problem is bitter espresso shots.  The first thing to check is if your beans are overroasted.  Presuming your input beans are good, and presuming the machine is functioning as intended.. let's go through how to troubleshoot.  Bitterness means overextraction which could be caused by a large number of factors, the top being too many grounds, coffee ground too fine, tamp technique, or even inserting the portafilter into the machine too early.  First thing is first, time your shot.  You should get roughly 2 fl oz of extract (2 shot glasses) in between 25-30 seconds.  Is it taking longer than this?  If so, this could be contributing to bitterness.  To remedy, reduce the amount of grounds in your portafilter, or grinder more coarse, both of which will speed up the extraction.  An additional complication, is if you tamp the grounds using too heavy a tamp, you can cause the extraction to run slow.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, if you decide the espresso is too acidic, you do exactly the opposite, namely, tighten the grind, make sure you are applying enough pressure during the tamp, or even add a gram or two of grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a reasonably simplified solution to troubleshooting espresso, but I hope it gives some insight into acidity vs bitterness, how to begin troubleshooting espresso shots etc.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I bloom coffee in a large percolator hopper?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've read that I should "wet the hopper" in a large metal percolator (35-100 cuppers).  I think that just means I shouldn't put the coffee into a dry pot, but I don't know what good that does me. Is it possible (or useful) to bloom 6-8 cups of coffee grounds the way I would with a drip coffee maker and how would I go about doing that?  &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You would bloom a large percolator the same way you would bloom in a pour over. Of course, there are different ideas about how to bloom for pour over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the website &lt;a href="https://handground.com/grind/47-tips-to-make-pour-over-coffee-like-a-barista" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Hand Ground&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a 1:1 coffee-to-water ratio for the bloom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bloom the heck out of the coffee&amp;quot; with a 2:1 ratio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stir the bloom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DON’T stir the bloom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bloom coffee in your percolator go through your normal routine except you will be adding less water. If you are using a 1:1 bloom subtract the mass of the coffee from the water you add to the reservoir. If you are using a 2:1 bloom, subtract twice the mass. Once you've added the coffee you will bloom it by pouring hot water evenly over the grounds. Because a percolator won't fit nicely on many scales, measure out your hot water first; this is probably easiest achieved by pouring into a pitcher on a scale until you've attained the equivalent mass of the coffee (or double). After pouring into the grounds, wait a minute. If you want to stir, stir. This might be a good idea because you are working with much more coffee than a standard pour over.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does my coffee at work have a paper/wood flavor?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm at a loss. I have tried everything to make coffee taste as good at work as it does at home, eliminating as many variables as possible. I do not do anything different in my brewing between home and work, but the coffee at home is hundreds of times better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start off with the basics... Equipment: We have a Bonavita BV1900TS at home and the older Bonavita BV1800TS at work. I have the all-stainless-steel carafe up here at work and use Melitta #4 bleached filters because of the different filter cone shape on the 1800 model, whereas at home I have (or had until it broke) the glass-lined carafe and Bunn bleached standard-size filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now about supplies: I'm using whole-bean coffee that I've roasted, which is never more than two weeks old. The coffee is really good. When I do a Clever at home, it tastes as that served in a really good coffee shop with baristas who know what they're doing. My water is always Ozarka Spring Water. It's world's better than Brita-filtered tap and seems to be the best of the spring waters available in this area without spending a ton of money. And, again, it makes for great coffee at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making coffee: I grind my coffee just before brewing at a drip grind size and use somewhere in the neighborhood of 10g per cup. I rinse both filters under water for 15 seconds or more and shake dry. We have no hot water at work currently, so I rinse under cold. Now I had the coffee to the filter basket and fill the reservoir with spring water. Last step, I turn the machine on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at home, the coffee I get out is exquisite. At work, it tastes like I'm licking a cup of hot postage stamps. What is happening?! Please help!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Since most of your variables above have been addressed and matched. Below are an additional few i could think of -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) Servicing of equipment. At least descalling once per month depending on how often machine gets used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) Someone at work "serviced" you machine with a strong dose of descaller, or didnt flush the system 3 times for both group head and steam wand. It is probable you are tasting descaller. To prevent descaller taste, use food grade coffee descaller recommended for your machine, any other chemical product maybe too strong and leave a lasting taste like CLR, vinegar etc.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does it make sense to buy smaller-sized bags of whole bean coffee to keep it fresher?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;How much impact has having a coffee bag being opened vs. sealed on preserving the aroma of beans over 1 month?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am deliberating between 250 gram and 500 gram packages, with the former being 4% more expensive per kilo then the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;250 grams lasts me about a month (allows for one 8-gram espresso equivalent every day), so buying the larger bag, in the second month I would be using beans which are stored one month longer in a opened bag then if I would be buying the smaller bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it make sense to opt for the smaller 1-month bags in this usage pattern, or is the difference going to be infinitesimal?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Trading off taste difference against price depends on how much each of them matters to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing an open bag of beans in the cabinet for 8 weeks probably does matter to taste, while a 4% price difference is easily in the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Taste Difference&lt;/h3&gt;
It seems fair to assume you care about taste differences since you're asking. So for that side of the comparison, it’s sufficient to ask whether you can taste any difference, and that’s fun and easy to test. See [this answer][1] on how to do a triangle test.
&lt;p&gt;Here's an experimental design for coffee bean storage duration: Weigh out the coffee into small plastic bags, put half the bags in the freezer and half the bags in the cabinet, then at different durations, defrost a frozen bag while still sealed (so the beans don't get water condensation from the air), and compare the coffee it makes against a bag from the cabinet. I did this with medium roast beans listed as “high body” and “bold acidity” so degradation would be readily noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 2 days, we could not distinguish the frozen from cabinet-stored beans. (That rules out the hypothesis that freezing hurts beans, at least when defrosted in the bag.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 4 weeks, we still could not distinguish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 12 weeks, all tasters could tell, and with high confidence. The &lt;strong&gt;frozen coffee tasted much better&lt;/strong&gt; than the room-temperature stored coffee. The frozen coffee tasted about the same as it did earlier (to the degree we can rely on taste memory) while the room-temperature stored coffee tasted completely flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caveats: That was just one kind of bean, made just one way, with 5 tasters who are no cross-section of the world’s population. But each taste test got “statistically significant” results for a hypothesis picked in advance. Good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubled the duration between each test, hence I didn't test 8 weeks. The taste impact of 8 weeks storage is still in play. Do try the test at 4 and 8 weeks with your favorite coffee. For discussion’s sake, let’s call it likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: If you want to stretch out the freshness of a 2 month supply, it’s viable to freeze some of it in small bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Price Difference&lt;/h3&gt;
Perception studies have a notion of “just noticeable difference” (JND). A smaller difference than that is unlikely to be noticeable (not the same as “measurable”). A starting assumption for a new domain is JND = 1dB (as it is for audio volume) which is about 26%, but a quick web search gets us a JND threshold for price from [Marketing As I know it][2]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it a 10% off sale fails to get your attention while a 50% off sale brings in consumers from the surrounding counties?
The reason the 10% sale does not excite is that it is below the JND. Research has proven that the JND for price tends to be between 20 to 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In context, a % comparison (whatever the percentage amount) assumes you have a budget or reference in mind for that expense. If the % difference blows your coffee budget, you could compensate by drinking less often, or better yet by making more of your coffee at home than from cafes. If you think of coffee as part of your overall food &amp;amp; drink budget, maybe you could make up a large price difference by drinking less soda or eating less meat (both of which are health and environmental improvements).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Alternatives to Aeropress?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;New aspiring coffee nerd here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm looking to do a hand grinder + french press setup. Mostly for home use, but small enough for travel would be a wonderful bonus. Low budget (under $100 total)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've narrowed my grinder options to the Hario Skerton or Porlex Mini. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the press, I was thinking the $30 Aeropress kit. However, I figured I might as well ask this stackexchange for other options you would recommend, if any? I like to explore alternatives before purchasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize if this has already been asked, I did a few searches for "aeropress alternatives" and did not find anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The Aeropress is the best choice for travel. I would get the Porlex Mini with it as it will fit inside the Aeropress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the Hario V60 is also a great choice for starting out, but this is a bit more bulky and not as good for travel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that although the Aeropress is durable, it can break if pressure is applied in the wrong direction. I had the plastic crack once after putting it in my checked bag. You might want to get a case for it or at least put it in your carry-on bag. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does coffee raise cholesterol levels?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Altering cholesterol is just one of the ways your daily cup of coffee affects your body. If you have elevated LDL cholesterol, should you cut down on your coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coffee does not include any form of cholesterol, as it is produced in the liver of animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some alcohols in coffee affect how cholesterol metabolizes in human body. Thus, indirectly affects cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extraction of these alcohols are mostly related with grounds contact period with water. So, we can say you should take care about the brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, cold-brew increases the cholesterol levels the most. Drip-brew and instant coffee the least. Turkish coffee increases a lot. French-press increases quite much. Espresso is somewhere in the middle. Pour-over filters are increasing just a little.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coffe is a natural product, and has a shelf life. The changes made to store the product for a longer period, makes the coffee deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee is at its best one week after roasting, and the shelf live is maximum 3-4 weeks after roasting. If the bag of coffee has a ‘best before’ or ‘use-by date’ rather than a ‘roast date’ it’s because whoever packaged the coffee would rather you didn’t know when it was roasted. &lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You can always try a mesh pour over like &lt;a href="https://www.banggood.com/Stainless-Steel-Pour-Over-Coffee-Dripper-Reusable-Double-Mesh-Coffee-Maker-Cone-Filter-p-1178093.html?gmcCountry=CA&amp;amp;currency=CAD&amp;amp;createTmp=1&amp;amp;utm_source=googleshopping&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc_elc&amp;amp;utm_content=zouzou&amp;amp;utm_campaign=pla-brand-elc2-ca&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA3JrQBRBtEiwAN7cEGhAH9NMCM24XHeiA4uqG6ZkX9wN7rjrKA-zmPuekBaCiioe_RPAt6xoCJ8cQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;cur_warehouse=CN" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also teapot like the one you described seems like it would work as well will coarser grinds (like the one needed for a french press) but like a french press leaving the grinds for too long will result in an &lt;a href="https://www.banggood.com/Stainless-Steel-Pour-Over-Coffee-Dripper-Reusable-Double-Mesh-Coffee-Maker-Cone-Filter-p-1178093.html?gmcCountry=CA&amp;amp;currency=CAD&amp;amp;createTmp=1&amp;amp;utm_source=googleshopping&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc_elc&amp;amp;utm_content=zouzou&amp;amp;utm_campaign=pla-brand-elc2-ca&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA3JrQBRBtEiwAN7cEGhAH9NMCM24XHeiA4uqG6ZkX9wN7rjrKA-zmPuekBaCiioe_RPAt6xoCJ8cQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;cur_warehouse=CN" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;overextracted bitter coffee&lt;/a&gt;.

  <title>Manual vs Automatic espresso machine</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking of transferring to manual machine from a semi automatic machine. What are the differences between manual and semi-automatic machines? I'm interested in how difficult they are to use and in getting consistent results. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Go manual and you’ll never go back. It’s like a stick shift: more fun ‘cause there is more to play with! I think there are numerous advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blessed silence. Pumps are not music to my ears when my brain is not yet caffeinated. I prefer to listen to hummingbirds outside the kitchen window than an espresso pump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awareness. You can feel the resistance of water flowing through the coffee. If you change the grind or tamping pressure, you get immediate feedback on how it has affected the extraction process. Grind beans straight from the freezer? It is obvious how temperature affects grind size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessing Grind/Tamping combination. Perfusion is determined by the product of grind size and tamping pressure. If your grind is a bit too course, this can be compensated by slightly harder tamping. How do you tell if you have the right combo? Count how many seconds it takes for the first drop to come out of the portafilter on boiler pressure alone. I use 4 seconds as the magic number. If I switch beans and the time goes up to 7 seconds, I know the new beans need a courser grind or a lighter tamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre-infusion: Boiler pressure (1 bar) is perfect for pre-infusion. This allows the grounds to soak through to their centers before extraction begins. I count off 10 seconds of pre-infusion before pulling the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Control of extraction time: How hard you lean on the lever will determine how long the extraction time is. I shoot for a total of 25 seconds from beginning of pre-infusion to the end of extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this becomes a flexible dance. Say you try a new bean but notice first drip time has gone up to 8 seconds. Reach over and tweak the grinder a bit courser. You know extraction time will be longer so shorten pre-infusion to 6 seconds. Use higher than normal pressure on the lever to keep extraction time to under 30 seconds. Extra crema from that higher pressure! Great shot but you know the next will be even better because the grinder has already been adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As satisfying as a heal-and-toe downshift in a decreasing radius corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, maybe not that good. But you can do the Emperor’s New Clothes routine on your guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I remember when I was the Food and Beverage Director for Starbucks in Greece and we were launching the first store in Greece back in 2002, we had to serve Greek coffee in the store. Apparently there is a law in Greece that requires all coffee shops to serve Greek coffee (...) ? specific combination of beans is used to make this Greek blend, with specific bean varieties, roasted at specific temperatures and used in specific ratios.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the history and significance of the "Anthora" coffee cup?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, my cousin brought back a souvenir porcelain "Anthora" coffee cup which is apparently a cultural icon of New York City. What is its history and significance; and is it still widely used in NYC today?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Anthora is a paper coffee cup design that has become iconic of New York City daily life. Its name is a play on the word amphora.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The cup was originally designed by Leslie Buck of the Sherri Cup Co. in 1963, to appeal to Greek-owned coffee shops in New York City, and was later much copied by other companies. The original Anthora depicts an image of an Ancient Greek amphora, a Greek key design on the top and bottom rim, and the words "WE ARE HAPPY TO SERVE YOU" in an angular typeface resembling ancient Greek, for example with an E resembling a capital sigma ("?", a letter pronounced like English "s"). The blue and white colors were inspired by the flag of Greece. The cup subsequently became the metropolitan area's definitive coffee-to-go cup.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Sales of the cup reached 500 million in 1994 (when it was by far the most popular design for the company's cups), but had fallen to about 200 million cups annually by 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthora" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found this article about its history and cultural significance posted on May 16, 2017 By Devin Gannon  at  www.6sqft.com:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.6sqft.com/the-history-behind-the-iconic-nyc-anthora-coffee-cups/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.6sqft.com/the-history-behind-the-iconic-nyc-anthora-coffee-cups/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable extracts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a city full of symbolism, from bright yellow taxis to black-and-white cookies, New Yorkers also find comfort and nostalgia in a certain cardboard coffee cup. Known as the Anthora, the blue-and-white drinking vessel first became an icon of New York City in 1963 when Leslie Buck, a Czech-American immigrant, designed the first ever to-go coffee cup to appeal to Greek-owned coffee shops and diners (...) The height of sales was in 1994 when Sherri sold over 500 million cups.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;After the Solo Cup Company bought Sherri in 2005, about 200 million cups per year were sold. A year later, with sales at a standstill, Solo Cup decided to halt its large-scale distribution. The company kept the design alive by selling its licenses to souvenir shops and restaurants. For example, MoMA’s gift store sells a ceramic version designed by Graham Hill in 2003, and many online stores like Amazon and UncommonGoods sell similar products. And it’s been seen in multiple movies and television shows set in New York; actors held the famous Anthora in hit shows like the Sopranos, NYPD Blue, Mad Men, and Law &amp;amp; Order.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The cup made an official comeback to the city in 2015, after the Dart Container company received many requests to bring it back to New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The triumphant return of the Anthora cup to New York was announced in this article dated 12/17/2015 at &lt;a href="https://www.dartcontainer.com/news/news-archives/news-stories/2015/12/the-comeback-cup-an-iconic-product-returns-to-the-new-york-city-market/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.dartcontainer.com/news/news-archives/news-stories/2015/12/the-comeback-cup-an-iconic-product-returns-to-the-new-york-city-market/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Comeback Cup: An iconic product returns to the New York City market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The original is back! The Anthora cup – once dubbed perhaps the most successful cup in history by The New York Times – returned in July as a regular stock item in the New York City market (...) “We had some competitors in the market who were selling knock-offs of the print and our sales people asked us to bring this cup back” (...) The cup and its retro look is expected to appeal to coffee-shop veterans who are familiar with its history as well as young customers who may be seeing it for the first time (...) Coffee sellers and drinkers don’t have to settle for pretenders anymore. The true Anthora – called iconic, ubiquitous and symbolic in its heyday – is ready to take its place as the comeback cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The replica ceramic cup is also mentioned and pictured in this blog post: &lt;a href="https://blog.retroplanet.com/nyc-greek-ceramic-coffee-mug/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://blog.retroplanet.com/nyc-greek-ceramic-coffee-mug/&lt;/a&gt; [Last updated: Feb 01, 2010]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The cups not only caught on quickly, but have become so symbolic of New York City life that they have been recreated in a ceramic version. Now a 10-ounce reusable cup is available that looks exactly like the original paper version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is the pattern of the ceramic cup my cousin brought back as a souvenir from New York a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Prevailing wisdom is that it is generally safe to drink up to 4 cups of coffee per day. Caffeine is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug (stimulant) and typical consumption is alleged to have a number of positive health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. &lt;a href="https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2015 Dietary Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; Advisory Committee recommended a similar limit. Lower limits are recommended for pregnant women, adolescents &amp;amp; children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lethal caffeine overdoses are rare and estimates of a lethal amount of caffeine in a healthy adult range from 10,000 - 20,000 mg.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Ideally for latte art you should have zero foam in the conventional sense i.e. coarse foam or froth that has easily discerned bubbles. What you want to achieve is to make a completely homogeneous pitcher of &lt;em&gt;microfoam&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why are Robusta beans considered 'low brow'?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I read that Robusta production is increasing in many 'only aribica' countries.  Is it 'low brow' because of lower profit margins or it is so lousy I should never let a sip cross my lips?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-latam-coffee-robusta/latin-americas-premium-coffee-growers-branch-out-to-cheaper-beans-idUSKBN1FR0JK" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Latin America’s premium coffee growers branch out to cheaper beans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Because they are low brow, that is lower quality and much less desirable. Robusta beans are generally regarded as inferior to Arabica and command about half the price. Many coffee producers will proudly proclaim that their coffee is 100% Arabica as a hallmark of quality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arabica beans produce a richer taste and have a better balance of sweet acidity. Sugar, fruit, berry and chocolate flavours are common and the characteristic winey taste of higher of higher quality coffee is due to Arabica's excellent acidity. Also the much remarked upon and pleasantly appealing aroma of roasting coffee is due to Arabica beans. Brazil is the largest producer and Arabica beans represent 75% of all coffee sold in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robusta by contrast has a stronger, harsher full bodied and more bitter taste with a grainy flavour profile and earthy or peanut aftertaste. Traditional Italian espresso blends typically incorporate about 10% Robusta because Robusta beans create more crema. The majority of Robusta beans go towards the bulk manufacturer of instant coffee where price trumps quality concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robusta beans contain more caffeine, are easier to grow and produce substantially higher yields. Vietnam is the largest producer.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to make Autocrat style coffee syrup</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Has anyone tried converting cold brew concentrate into Autocrat style coffee syrup? My daughters enjoy coffee milk.  Can I cold brew the beans in the syrup, or do I need to add sugar to the concentrate and cook it down to a syrup?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you are referring to Autocrat coffee syrup, which is basically just corn sugar syrup with a bit of coffee concentrate (and likely some preservatives). So yes you can make it yourself, by making or buying sugar syrup and then add some cold brew concentrate et voilà.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold brewing the beans in the sugar syrup I wouldn't try, I don't think it will extract very well, since the syrup is not liquid enough and the water in the syrup already quite saturated with sugars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cook down the cold brew with sugar, it will be super high in caffeine concentrate. I don't know how old your girls are, but high doses of caffeine are not usually recommended for children.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>quality of water for cold brew and packaging</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Can i pack cold brew in a high quality PET bottle? Or must it be in a glass bottle? Also,  must filtered water always be used for cold brew? Or clean tap water can do the job? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This question differs greatly on a couple key factors. First, whether it is just for your own use, and second, how long you want to keep it for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are drinking this yourself, you can make it and bottle it however you like. Whether that means doing what is easiest with what is available or going all out and buying supplies, it's up to you. If you are giving it to others or possibly selling it (your question is pretty ambiguous), then you want to try and create the most delicious cold brew you can at the most economical price. Glass definitely looks a lot better, and as I will talk about next, brings better flavour when kept refrigerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to drink it the day or two after you make it, then a plastic bottle is probably fine, but the main difference is how well the bottle keeps out light, and lets out air. It may seem as though plastic is completely air tight, but there can be gases exchanged through plastic that can change the composition of the coffee chemistry. If you want a liquid to stay fresh for longer, glass is always a better bet than plastic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Can i pack cold brew in a high quality PET bottle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;CAN&lt;/em&gt; make cold brew however you want. Tap water and PET bottles are fine for easy home brewing. It is, however, widely acknowledged that water plays a much more vital role in coffee brewing than previously thought, and when your coffee grounds are in contact with water for many hours as is the case in cold brew, you can suffer from that. Good water and glass bottles will always be better than tap water and plastic bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Replaced gasket on moka pot and it misbehaves - should the gasket be treated with anything?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;First of all, I've seen &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/3382/2761"&gt;Why does my moka pot sputter?&lt;/a&gt;, which covers a very similar issue but has no answers and doesn't ask the specific question I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 6 cup Bialetti is probably from the 1960s, but the modern gasket still fits and I've replaced it before (over 10 years ago, but I don't use it daily). It was blowing steam from the screw joint so I checked and replaced the cracked gasket. With the new one, I get about a teaspoonful of thick coffee before the sputtering (that normally marks the end of the brew) starts from the tower. If I leave it sputtering I eventually get a little less than I should, but enough to drink. I don't normally tamp it, but smooth over the grounds with the back of a teaspoon before wiping the sealing face of the basket with my hand. I use a very small gas ring, with flames smaller than the base (a little smaller to start, reducing once the flow starts). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming there were grounds caught in the seal, once I took the seal out and cleaned it, before assembling wet. It behaved much better, but only that time. I normally only rinse the pot (it's very well seasoned) but I'll give it a good scrub before I next use it. I wonder if the seal doesn't seal very well dry, and whether wiping a thin layer of neutral cooking oil over it would help. Is this a good idea? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you know your Moka pot well, and it is true that it is an easy way to get deliciously strong coffee. That being said, it can also be very nuanced in how it works. First, your new gasket should seal perfectly well and as long as there is no sputtering from the screw joint, it is good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sputtering means that you are forcing too much steam too quickly through the grounds and into the pot. Try using a high heat to get the coffee flowing, then adjust the heat to keep an even flow into the top chamber. It's possible that with a bad seal, extra pressure was being release from the screw joint and now it is all being directed through the "tower".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Do coffee connoisseurs add anything to their coffee when tasting a new coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When tasting new coffees, is the flavor of the brewed coffee best understood without milk and sugar? Or should they be tried without adding any milk and sugar in them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My intuition tells me that the coffee should be tried without anything added to it. That being said it doesn't seem like it would normally be enjoyed in that manner if the taster is drinking it without milk and sugar (if he adds that to his coffee usually).&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Your intuition is correct, modifiers like sugar or creme will only obscure a lot of nuance so connoisseurs, professionals &amp;amp; judges will try new coffees or espresso as brewed without adding anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the quality of coffee and a person's preferences they may sometimes add something after the initial taste. And some connoisseurs may order something like an espresso macchiato (espresso with a tiny amount of textured milk) or routinely add e.g. one sugar when drinking a coffee that they are familiar with or just for variety. But in general the better the quality of coffee and the more serious the connoisseur, the less likely they are to be adding anything to their coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly if you are trying to discern what a new coffee tastes like, you shouldn't be adding anything initially (coffee roasters and buyers have a special method for tasting nuances in new coffees called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&amp;amp;d=cupping-protocols" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;cupping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). Even if you customarily like to add something if you want to learn more about coffee and improve your palate you should at least have a sip before adding anything so that you develop a better ability to discern subtle differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espresso like scotch can be an acquired taste for some and they may find that they add less sweetener over time as the intense taste grows on them. And it's worth noting that high quality coffee has a rich, winey base overlaid with desirable flavours and little, if any bitterness. And properly textured milk in lattes is already quite sweet and creamy in texture so there is little, if any need for additional sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to save over extracted coffee made using Dutch cold brew method?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have just started using our Dutch Coffee Maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our virgin experience was quite a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had some ground coffee (given to us as a gift) that was too fine (espresso grind), and the coffee came out over extracted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we do to save the over extracted coffee? We do not want to throw it away :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Can we get a dutch-coffee tag? Cold brew is not quite dutch :) or maybe enlighten me on which tags I should use. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Well, when you are talking about cold-brewing methods, you will always want coarse ground coffee. If you are set on using this finely ground coffee in your Dutch Coffee Brewer you will want to try a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, use much less coffee. Yes, it will still over extract over the same time period but will not be as strong. This is probably the worst option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, brew faster. I know that in a Dutch Brewer this is more complicated than just letting it sit for less time. If there is a way to put more water through the grounds in less time, you will want to go with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, use a different brew method for the finely ground coffee and buy new coffee for your Dutch brewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are my options for approximating espresso at work?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Lately I have developed a taste for espresso during the day, when I'm at work. There are several problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no espresso machine at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no stove at work, so a stovetop moka pot is not an option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's no time to leave the office to get a coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no chance of putting an espresso machine in the office (not even Nespresso): I would be the only user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've thought of two solutions, neither of which is very appealing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40-60 mL of really strong instant coffee: ugh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aeropress coffee: a lot of setup and fiddling for something that doesn't really scratch the itch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have an Aeropress, so that'll be the solution if necessary, but does anyone have a better idea?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I don't want to provide any specific product links here since they may change in the future and I also don't want to advertise specific stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there are some options I can think of. There are electric Moka pots that have the stove already built into them. Bialetti is the go to brand for Moka pots. I'm certain that they will fit in your office, even on your desk if need be. Alternatively you can get a small electric stove for the Moka pot you already have. It will also fit on your desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option would be portable espresso makers. Handpresso Wild Hybrid and Wacaco are the only ones I know of. I've heard good things about the Handpresso, but can't attest to them since I haven't tried one yet. They work with pressure, which the Moka pots don't do, so they should come closer to Espresso from a machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I personally would stick with the AeroPress. In my opinion it makes by far better, more complex coffee than the other options.There are also some tweaks, like using two filter papers, using a metal filter, very fine grind size, tamping the coffee, high coffee to water ratio and tweaks/&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIfZ84qtBOc" rel="noreferrer"&gt;constructions&lt;/a&gt; to apply more pressure, that make a more espresso like drink. Note however that the AeroPress is not built to withstand several bars of pressure and constructions like the one in the video are neither practical, nor safe. The other tweaks mentioned however can safely increase pressure to a point where you get pretty neat, espresso like results.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Distilled tasting coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed that coffee can have a distilled water taste and if they do anything about it.  &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coffee cannot taste like distilled water. It's not possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what you mean is that the coffee in question tastes too clean or too dry. That can be caused by using filtered water with too low dissolved solids or water with too high sodium content. The best water to use for brewing is generally thought to be hard water rich in magnesium and calcium, with no chlorine and low sodium content. If the dry, flat taste of coffee bothers you, try using mineral water, or, if you really want to experiment, buy water additive made specifically for making brewing water like Third Wave (you can find it on Amazon). You mix this additive with distilled water to create mineral water. You can also make your own water additive with 0.75g epsom salt and 0.36g baking soda per gallon of distilled water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water quality is very likely the problem if coffee consistently tastes flat, dry, or "clean". The only way to test this is to try the same brew with different water.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can regular drip coffee grounds be used for pour over coffee and achieve good results?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Can you use regular drip coffee for pour over, and if you do will the coffee taste OK?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;, it'll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drip brewing and pour-over coffee are essentially the same process:  Pour hot water over ground coffee to extract flavor compounds, then let the infused hot water solution drip through a filter into a serving vessel.  As far as the final product is concerned, it doesn't especially matter if this happens in a machine that dispenses the hot water automatically (drip brewing), or if you pour the water yourself by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason coffee grounds might be suitable for one but not the other would be if you use different filters for drip brewing and pourovers.  For instance, if you have a drip coffee machine that takes paper filters, but a standalone metal mesh filter that you use for pourovers, you would want to use slightly coarser coffee grounds for the latter.  Even in this case, though, the worst possible outcome would be that your coffee might be a little cloudy or gritty, just like if your grounds were slightly too fine (because that's exactly what's happened).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What kind of Foam goes best with types of coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been visiting various cafes and type of milk foam varies each and every time whether it's normal or silky(that's what I got to know from one of the barista)  make me think about the type of foams that goes with types of coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any such thing or it depends on various cafes and barista's way of making coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's just a matter of tradition, style and skill. Traditionally the thick, hard foam with bigger bubbles is used in Italy for Cappuccini. Same goes for espresso macchiato. Sometimes the milk foam is spooned on top of the espresso. In other countries they often imitated italian style coffee, which is why e.g. in Germany the foam is usually very thick as well. In Australia they developed italian coffee culture further and usually froth more silky (and make flat whites with it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to skill, it is much harder to produce silky foam than the "traditional" foam. You have to start with cold milk, then introduce air at first, but also not too much and lastly spin the milk/foam mixture to break up big bubbles and to work the froth into the milk. In order to do all that you have to get the depth of the spout in the milk right, you have to get the angles right and you have to be careful not to heat the milk too much, because otherwise the foam will become too thick and hard (and the milk will get bitter). For the thicker foam you can basically just put the pitcher under the steam wand, let it sit for a while and come back. Not gonna be pretty what you fine there, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third wave and specialty coffee shops usually froth the milk to a silky texture, so called micro foam. That's a different style and there several reasons for it why it is done that way. The most important one is that the taste is superior. Frothed milk above 70 degrees starts tasting bitter. Most specialty coffee barista probably froth the milk to somewhere between 62 and 64 degrees. That way you get a sweet taste and micro-foam. For the thicker foam you would need higher temperatures and thus destroy the taste of the milk.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Remedy for a coffee hangover?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Did you ever drink too much coffee during the week, and then on your day off you have this really tired feeling with a headache?  I call it a coffee-hangover.  It has nothing to do with alcohol just too much coffee.  I'm looking for a remedy to this, but not a remedy involving coffee; I'd prefer to save that for the week. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's probably a caffeine &amp;quot;withdrawal&amp;quot; symptom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/caffeine-myths-and-facts" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you stop taking caffeine abruptly, you may have symptoms for a day
or more, especially if you consume two or more cups of coffee a day.
Symptoms of withdrawal from caffeine include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;headache
fatigue
anxiety
irritability
depressed mood
difficulty concentrating
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  <title>Cafe Mai vietnamese coffee - what is the US equivalent?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was at an AirBnb in Washington DC and the host (or previous guest) had left coffee in the cupboard. Only enough for 12 cups or so, and I'm feeling guilty that I consumed the entire packet over couple of days without replenishing.  Anyway, it was 'Cafe Mai' brand like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zZHqY.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zZHqY.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am wondering what is the nearest thing I can buy in the US. Flying to Vietnam to visit the (famous) coffee shop isn't going to happen any time soon :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see a few types on their website (&lt;a href="http://cafemai.vn" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://cafemai.vn&lt;/a&gt;), like "Paris Mai", "Moca", "Aliculi Dac Lac", "Espresso Viet Nam", "Buon Me Thuot", but I can't work out from the photos what I had.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I would say that the easiest way to get authentic vietnamese coffee in Washington DC would be to go to an asian supermarket and buy a pack of vietnamese coffee. I've never been to DC, but I just googled "Asian supermarket in Washington DC" and also "Vietnamese supermarket in Washington DC" and plenty of option show up. So it should be easy to pick one that's close to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that vietnamese coffee is of the Robusta species and the roast profile is quite dark. So you can also just go to a well sorted supermarket and buy a pack of Robusta dark roast beans/grounds, preferably of vietnamese origin. It will be more or less the same as the coffee roasted by vietnamese roasters.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;MT San' answer is not correct. He gives a link for Moka Express measurement. Brikka is different. 2 cup version should be filled with 60-70 ml of water in the bottom chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does using a french press effect the taste of coffee vs the manual method?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My normal method is put coffee in cup. Put some hot water for 30 seconds. Put remaining hot water for 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strain and drink. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if I buy a french press machine should I expect a change in taste of the resultant coffee? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In the case you are describing there won't be a big difference to French press, assuming that you are able to strain the coffee as well as you could with a french press. As long as you manage to strain it properly so that most of the coffee particles are gone the result would ceteris paribus be similar (which means same times, same pre infusion, same water and same temperatures, same grind size, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is because the methods would be identical, they are both full immersion brewing techniques. In both cases you pour the water on the grounds, let it brew and strain in the end. There are many tips on how to improve your brews with these kind of methods on the coffee stackexchange.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why do coffee carafes never pour well?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been a coffee drinker forever and no matter what coffee maker I buy, all of the carafes are terrible. Is there one that pours well? Or is there a trick I do not know about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I notice that when the coffee level is lower in the carafe it pours better and spills less.. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is correct and it has a reason. Actually three. Let me explain...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I want you to consider the shape of the Hario Buono Coffee Drip Kettle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QfGZ2.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QfGZ2.jpg" alt="Hario Buono Coffee Drip Kettle"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, a Turkish tea kettle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lj51z.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lj51z.jpg" alt="Turkish tea kettle"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can clearly see, both have separate spouts. The special design of the spout make the flow of the liquid as &lt;em&gt;laminar&lt;/em&gt; as possible while you pour it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our first concern, why don't coffee carafes don't have this special spout that starts from the bottom, makes a curve and ends at the top, apart from the body of the carafe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case, the coffee at rest in the spout will loose so much heat and become cold rapidly. This is not what we desire. We want the coffee carafes to keep heat as stable as possible. So, we want to keep coffee all together, apiece, in one place together. That's why, coffee carafes have only one (not very nice) spout at the top. This is our first reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here comes our second one, for liquids, or in general for fluids, you have a magic number, called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Reynolds number&lt;/a&gt;. This number is (simply) kind of the ratio in between how particles are carried by the total motion of the coffee (inertial forces) and the resistance against being carried (viscous forces). When inertial forces are too much against viscous forces, your coffee starts to tremble by definition. This is what happens when you start to pour your coffee. Apparently, when the angle in between the carafe's spout and the vertical to the earth's gravitational vector is close to 90 degrees, Reynolds number will be bigger than when it is close to 0 degrees. This explains why emptier carafes have more laminar flow during pouring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, the third. Fluids also have another magic number called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_number" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Weber number&lt;/a&gt;. This number explains why surface tension effects your pouring. As in the previous case, also surface tension adds an extra complexity to the flow while you pour with greater degrees. The surface tension forces your coffee to form droplets. As a result, instead of having a perfect laminar flow, you end up a turbulent and sometimes intermittent with droplets flow while you try to pour when your carafe is full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a few other interesting concepts like Ohnesorge number and others. But I hope these could explain it all.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How does one calculate extraction percent?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am reading “Everything But Espresso” by Scott Rao and am in the chapter “The Coffee Brewing Control Chart”.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the section “How to Calculate Extraction without a Chart”, he says you need three values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brew strength (total dissolved solids)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dry coffee mass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brewed coffee mass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You plug those values into the following two equations to get extraction percent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDS% x Brewed Coffee Mass = Extracted Mass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extraction% = (Extracted Mass) / (Dry Mass)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my question is: how do you get brewed coffee mass?  Do you have to take out your mug before you start everything and then weigh the solution afterwards?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, is it necessary to have a refractometer to calculate the TDS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without knowing how to get those two variables, I obviously can’t solve the whole equation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any tips on any of this is greatly appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You have everything right. If you want Extraction % you need to measure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total dissolved solids: You will have to measure this using a refractometer. There are many out there, for commercial settings they start at around 300€. I have no experience with cheaper, "home use" refractometers but I'd assume they lack accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry coffee mass (in g): You have to weigh the ground coffee before brewing, that's all there is to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brewed coffee mass: As in 2. you will have to weigh your brew. Tar your kitchen scale with the cup on it, brew coffee and put the cup back. Voila.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you just all pluck it in the equation and you are good to go. Suppose you have 15g of ground coffee, yield 190g of brewed coffee with a TDS of 1,3%, which is great for a pour over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That gives you an extracted mass of 2,47g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2,47g/15g = 0.165. So the extraction % would be 16,5%.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are instructions on maintenance and cleaning in the refractometers manual. However with distilled water and soft towels/tissues and/or Q-tips for the edges (be careful not to scratch the prism with the plastic handle) you can get rid of all the residue. Don't use alcohol or something like that. If the oils don't come off or if it's really dirty you could use a little bit of mild detergent in the water and wipe it with distilled water at the end to get rid of any detergent residue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I turned the machine off and left it for a few minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I repeated steps 2 and 3 a few times.&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>What ensures a better cup of coffee, a spotless grinder or freshly ground coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I want to understand how I can make a better cup of coffee, so I recently purchased a Wilfa Grinder. However after reading the instruction manual it says that the 'blades' and bean cup cannot be submerged in water, only wiped clean. This means that you're never really going to get it spotlessly clean like you can with a manual grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is which of the following two scenarios provide a better cup of coffee:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grinding from very good beans each time using the Wilfa Grinder, knowing that there will always be some old coffee residue on the blades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying 250g of the same very good coffee, but having it ground before delivery?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always grind fresh.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that the roaster you buy the 250 gr pre-ground coffee also uses some grinder and at most wipes its burrs daily, I would go for the first option. The residual coffee could be easily removed by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wiping reachable parts first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then grinding a small amount of fresh coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;before actually grinding for your cup.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Will drinking coffee affect my physique?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am a 16 year old student who has decided to drink coffee so that I can study for a longer period of time at night but I am getting information that coffee can make me skinny. But what if I just a little bit of coffee, will it affect my physique?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The only thing I can think of that would cause weight loss with black coffee consumption is if you eat less due to the appetite suppressant that coffee can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then again, drinking more of anything is an appetite suppressant. Even water. On the flip side, you can gain a lot of weight if you ingest high-calorie confections, such as any ice-blended coffee drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my notes really only apply to black coffee drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that caffeine makes it easier for you to expend more energy. In the short run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your body will eventually adjust to your daily levels of caffeine. You'll have to drink more and more to get the same energy effects. Eventually, you'll have to drink coffee just to feel "normal."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally believe this also applies to any weight-loss potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall effects on weight loss are likely minimal, but will vary depending on how your coffee habit changes your eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I usually buy my coffee from dark arts, ozone, climpson &amp;amp; sons and workshop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually buy natural as I feel it has more flavour than washed and is better with Moccamaster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I struggling to find natural lately? Is it out of favour? I can’t find natural at any of this places anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Consumers (and marketers) are expanding their vocabulary for describing coffee. And at the same time coffee producers are improving and refining their methods. Both of these I think contribute to what you're seeing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term "natural" process can be ambiguous. You might try to search on a more specific, technical term "Dry Process," usually a synonym for natural process. Here's some dry process green offerings from &lt;a href="https://www.sweetmarias.com/green-coffee.html?sm_process_method=81&amp;amp;sm_status=1" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Sweet Maria&lt;/a&gt; for example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for processing, dry process is going out of style in favor of the (technologically speaking) superior wet processing techniques. Wet process allows better removal of defects (bad seeds) and other benefits for making higher quality and more consistent product. As you note processing has impact on flavor. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has a good overview of different aspects of coffee production, and roaster web sites like &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/frequency/coffee-processing-basics" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt; have overviews with their philosophy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia and Northern Africa tend to use dry process more often than other regions, due to the dry environment conditions well suited for the dry process. You might focus your search on beans sourced from that region.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Intermittent Bottomless Filter Spray -- Any Suggestions?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Rancilio Silvia and a Breville Conical Burr Grinder.  We roast our own beans using a Behmor 1600, and typically do kinda light roasts.  Very often, regardless of the bean, roast, packing pressure, or grind size (as far as I can tell), our bottomless filter sprays coffee all over the place.  Occasionally, it works fine, but the vast majority of the time it sprays at angles that I thought were impossible (i.e. approaching 90? to vertical).  Has anyone had this experience and do you have any suggestions for fixing it (or even troubleshooting it)?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>opening a new unopened Starbuck's coffee bag</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;is it possible to open a new Starbucks coffee bag by pulling the flaps apart,  I've never been able to do so ? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know of a way to separate the flaps by any other means without
causing a tear in the side of the bag, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I always prefer to cut this type of bag open. There probably isn't TOO much chance of plastic ending up in your coffee grounds, but I feel better with a clean cut rather than the ragged ends.  Starbucks has top quality machinery, so their bags are always sealed very thoroughly, thus hard to open. With some other companies the heat seal on the bags is not as perfect, so the bags are easy to open. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it a good idea to keep a coffeemaker if I only occasionally drink coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Say just two or three cups of coffee per week. Is cleaning these a trouble?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Cleaning is a hassle, sure. But something else to consider is the recurring cost of the coffee itself. Where I live, a bag of coffee costs almost as much as a coffee maker. Cheap coffee makers can be found for as little as $10 - $20. Small French presses are around $20 to $30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_(unit)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A customary "cup" of coffee in the U.S. is usually defined as 4 fluid ounces, which is the commonly used as the measure for an amount of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you really mean just a few "cups" per week, then it might not be worth it to buy a coffee maker, because your bagged coffee will probably get stale before you can even use it all. Just grab a drink from your local coffee shop occasionally.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How long can we safely store cold brew concentrate?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;How long can we store cold brew? 
Does storing cold brew for a week or more affect its taste or texture provided that we use good grinding beans and make it under proper ratio?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In my experience, if you have sanitised your equipment properly you should get three to four weeks when storing cold brew in a ready-to-drink ratio in the fridge. My feeling is that concentrate would probably have a longer shelf life, but by how much I can't really say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taste will change over time depending on how well filtered the cold brew is. If it is only lightly strained or filtered, a lot of coffee solids will remain in the brew and make it stronger/bolder over time (sometimes it can be quite nice). If it is well filtered and clear, then the flavour will be pretty consistent until it starts to go sour or bad.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to verify grinder switch works</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just read today in my Jura A7 manual:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;CAUTION
  If you adjust the consistency of grind when the grinder is not operating, the grinder adjustment switch could be damaged. Only adjust the consistency of grind when the grinder is running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I rotated grinder switch a few times while the machine was turned off, I'd like to verify it's working fine - or maybe it's already broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is:
&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of a broken grinder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;By checking if it grinds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's think about the mechanism of a grinder. Why grinders may get damaged if you adjust them when the burrs are not rotating?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A perfect coffee grinder design is a very serious engineering problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to have two very rigid burrs. When you don't have this rigidity, burrs may be damaged under high pressure of stuck coffee beans. Also, you don't want them to change their ideal shape in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want the burrs to rotate in opposite directions when they are so close to each other. The distance of the burrs must be equal at every rotational position to produce consistent ground. In practice, every grinder is a bit skewed from the ideal position. So, burrs are closer to each other at one angular position and more apart at another position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want a heat conducting material to keep the beans from burning after all the friction in between the burrs. Also, you don't want the heat deposit on the burrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caution you've noticed is mostly relevant to the second bullet. If, by mistake, you squeeze the burrs so close to each other they may damage each other in the next run. So, they can grind each other. While the grinder is running, even if you want to, you cannot squeeze till they touch. Even if you do, you suddenly hear a loud noise to release the setting a bit. However, if the grinder stops at an (somewhat) apart position and you squeeze them to touch, you cannot notice that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it grinds consistently, probably it is OK. But do not gamble again.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Improving my Brikka moka pot use</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Brikka and I'm trying to improve the coffee I make. 
I have seen &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2350/how-to-properly-use-the-bialetti-brikka"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post, but am using an electric stove instead of a gas range. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q1: Does anyone use one with an electric element as opposed to gas? What kind of heat setting do you use for it?  What I tried today was, after boiling the water initially, setting the element at about 40% of maximum, and once I saw the first bit of coffee appearing in the upper chamber, reduced to it to about 15%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q2: if I end up with a violent frothing action (which I understand makes the coffee more bitter, and is to be avoided) does that mean I have done something wrong? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have used a regular old Moka Express (the simpler version without the "crema" thingie) for years, and always on an electric stove. But the same should apply for your Brikka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. An electric stove is fine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you are starting with boiling water, go medium-to-low, reduce heat to a minimum once the coffee starts to rise/appear - or even turn it off, see 2. below. If you are starting with cold water (I can't be fiddling with a hot metal vessel after a short night and without sufficient caffeine in my system - see &lt;a href="https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/31514995#31514995"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/34688024#34688024"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;),initially go full-speed to minimize the not-so-hot water trickling through phase, then proceed as described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Violent frothing may be a sign of different things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My first suspicion would be you missing the sweet spot of turning the heat down in time - or too much residual heat in your stove top. Note that electric plates are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; slower to react that gas, where you can instantly cut the heat. Learn to "play" your specific stove, and as an emergency measure, simply lift the Brikka off the stove.&lt;br&gt;
A second issue could be the grind. While a Moka needs a finer grind than drip, a true espresso grind is too fine (and a common beginner's mistake when making "stovetop espresso"). In the best case, a too-fine grind will just be over-extracted and give you a lot of dregs in the cup. But the fine grid will also compact more, so that your machine will be working at a higher-than intended pressure. It may be enough to trigger the valve, but it may also be ever so slightly below the critical value, still giving you a rather forceful "volcanic action" (as I observed in the context of &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3356/coffee-ground-too-finely-how-to-deal-with-it"&gt;this question)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Requirements for Nel Drip Coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a question about Nel Drip coffee requirements.
Recently I've been checking few blogs and articles about this type of brewing, it mostly leads to these "settings":
- Old coffee beans
- Coarse ground
- Low temperature
- Grounds to water ratio at about 1:4, with the grounds being about 40 to 50 gr&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of that requirements seems odd to me, it contradict with any other pour over methods, except for the coarse grind setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is:
Can anyone explain why it is better to use old coffee beans, low temperature, and 1:4 ratio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What type of coffee maker creates the most coffee scent?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I stopped drinking coffee for a while but recently picked it back up, mainly because I enjoy the scent.  Previously I had a Keurig machine; convenient, but produces almost no smell during brewing.  Until I broke it a couple days ago, I was trying out a french press.  Again, very little of that heavenly wakeup scent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What method of coffee making will best fill the house with coffee scent?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you want a lot of scent, you will want to make sure that nothing stops evaporation - so no lid and a large surface area are paramount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic method would be hand-filtered pour-over, which system you choose is up to you, famous examples are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melitta_Bentz" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Melitta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemex_Coffeemaker" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chemex&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.hario.jp/seihin/productlist.php?bigclass=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Hario&lt;/a&gt; (which all follow the same principle). And as an additional benefit you get to enjoy the aroma right there while you are brewing the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative could be Turkish &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;mocca&lt;/a&gt;, where super-fine grounds are boiled. The boiling process will likely create more steam, on the other hand, the surface area of a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cezve" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;cezve&lt;/a&gt; is a lot smaller than that of a filter. You will also have a quite different end product and have to decide for yourself whether that fits your expectation or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in any case, I recommend grinding your beans fresh just before brewing, you’ll be surprised at how much of a difference that alone will be. And grinding also releases the coffee smell you are aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I make coffee without a machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I love coffee. As I am a student and living in a hostel I do not have any machine and I can not afford to go out for coffee everyday. I still want to make coffee, so how I can make smooth coffee without a machine?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Cold brew, SUPER simple version. A.K.A. my college days version. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One tbsp of any coffee per cup of water. Let it sit in the fridge for about 12 hrs. Pour and drink. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my college days I got a half gallon milk jug. Washed it out of course. Which is about 8 cups. I would put 8 tbsp of any coffee I could get my hands on and put it in the fridge over night. No heating water, no other preparations, no shaking, nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I would fill my coffee mug and put 2 sugar cubes (about 40 calories BTW) or honey into the cup and microwave it to a drinkable temperature. When you get close to the bottom it will be like mud, full of coffee grinds. I would just toss that out and start the next one for the next day. I think I calculated that with the cost of the sugar cubes and coffee it was like 15 cents per cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tips: the thought that more coffee will deliver more caffeine is true but I found that a ratio of more than 1.5 tbsp of coffee per cup of water can make it to bitter to enjoy. Plus I found that the time in the fridge does not have to be precise if you stick to the 1 tbsp to 1 cup plan. There were times when I left it in there for 20 hours and it was still drinkable.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>If I only occasionally brew at home, should I keep instant or grounds (or something else)?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/4471/is-it-a-good-idea-to-keep-a-coffeemaker-if-i-only-occasionally-drink-coffee"&gt;Is it a good idea to keep a coffeemaker if I only occasionally drink coffee?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, I produce less than 2 cups of coffee per week. Lately, I've been using instant to keep the hassle-payout ratio favorable. (hassle such as the actual process of producing one cup, as well as storing the requisite equipment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to buy ground coffee, it would take me months (or longer) to finish even a 10oz tin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it better to keep fairly old coffee grounds for that occasional cup, or to use instant coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I've been that person - I kept ground coffee forever. The difference in taste between fresh and old ground coffee is enormous, but so is the difference between old grounds and instant. It's just a completely different beverage, so I would say if these are your two options, it's just a matter of personal taste (I would go for old grounds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're up for it, I would buy a small manual grinder and keep whole beans, it makes a world of a difference in taste and you can keep the beans for months without deterioration. Adds a bit of work to the process though, and depending on your coffee maker would require a grinder with different abilities (espresso would require much finer grinding degree than let's say a mokka express).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to avoid channels when pouring espresso</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been having issues with my espresso pouring too fast, and I think I'm getting channels (uneven pour, sometimes one side gets blonde then watery pretty quickly). I'm paying a lot of attention to the tamping process, so I'm not sure if this is the problem. That's what I do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make sure the grounds are distributed evenly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tamp evenly to &lt;a href="https://baristahustle.com/blog/how-hard-should-you-tamp/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;maximum density&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read somewhere that the portafilter should be dry. However, I heat my portafilter in the grouphead, so when I take it out to prepare the coffee there's some condensation in the portafilter so it's not completely dry - any experience with this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If the espresso is pouring too fast it most likely means you need to grind finer, not tamp harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid channels you first need to make sure your machine's pressure is not too high. 9 bars is the usual pressure, but &lt;a href="https://strivefortone.com/2016/05/18/this-low-pressure-rehash/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;there is evidence that 7 bars will reduce channeling&lt;/a&gt;. Many consumer machines come with 12-15 bars of pressure which is simply too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you need a proper grinder that will have a consistent grind and not produce clumps, otherwise your cake density will not be even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your distribution and tamping must be even. Tamping too hard is not necessary. Some people have good results only &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z5vTi643sc" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;using a distributor/leveler and not tamping&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure your tamper/leveler matches your basket size exactly. Sometimes you need a +0.5mm or +0.3mm over the written size to actually match your basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, make sure your shower and basket do not have obstructed holes. You should use Cafiza regularly to clean your group head, portafilter, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee machine for a small business</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;We have gone through a couple different coffee machines, here at work, none of which are sufficient. We started with a normal brew machine (doesn't make enough) and worked our way up to a percolator (eventually broke down) and now we have decided that it might be worth an investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we want is a machine that we can simply plug a water line into, fill it with beans and press a button to brew either an individual cup or perhaps a pitcher we don't care just as long as its easy, quick and somewhat hands-off. The catch is we aren't looking for a thousand dollar machine, any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h3&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you want a bean-to-cup brew machine, you're limiting yourself quite a bit in terms of choice. That can be a good thing as it narrows down your options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to bean-to-cup brew machines I'd recommend the &lt;a href="https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/coffee/bdc650.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Breville Grind Control™&lt;/a&gt;. It's not a commercial-size machine, but with only 6 people that would probably make it needlessly expensive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I have no first hand experience with the machine, I recommend watching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im8jAbAc4Vo" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this YouTube video, again by SCG&lt;/a&gt;, to get a good impression of the machine. Should you have machine-specific questions then I recommend asking those as a separate question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for price, it's advertised at around 300$ on Breville's website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for capacity, it's 60 oz (1.77L) machine. That means you can get 7 decent cups (250 mL / 8.45 oz) out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have some control on strength (in practice, more or less coffee going in) and grind size (finer or coarser grind). Furthermore, the can is insulated so your coffee keeps warm longer as opposed to machines that keep the can at a certain temperature (which eventually impacts taste).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only criterium it doesn't meet is the ability to connect it to your water line. You might be able to make it work somehow, but it's not a feature of this machine (as opposed to others which are designed to be built into a kitchen or something).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For non-Americans&lt;/strong&gt;: note that the machine is rated for 110-120 volts. It may not work in places with higher voltages and I'm not sure if there's a higher voltage version of this machine. Just something to consider before buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer consists of three parts. The first is an on-topic advice. The second is an option to get more information to better inform you which could be used to edit / ask a new question that is more refined. The last part is more of a comment which you should take note of in a purchasing situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Advice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without knowing any more specifics, I understand that you don't want to spend a lot of money and that brew machines worked in the past but lacked capacity. I'm going to suggest getting multiple consumer-grade-ish brew machines, possibly with some fancier options (e.g. programmable turn on and off times). Since these features are so general, I cannot recommend a specific machine, but you can easily find some based on those criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Info on commercial grade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seattle Coffee Gear has a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c64MQKd61GI&amp;amp;list=PLxsjzGY0Fi2SyoExt3c7L7WSNHgDKJ2rv" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;playlist on YouTube dedicated to coffee makers for commercial use&lt;/a&gt;. With your description, it's hard to give good advice, but I think you can get pretty far by going through all the videos (I am not affiliated with them, I just know they make good videos).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest watching those videos to either settle on one of those options or to refine your criteria and post them here. Things you may want to specify:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price (range)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy consumption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brew versus espresso-based&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for cleaning, you're going to have to do some level of cleaning with any coffee machine. Can you minimise or automatise it? Yes, but never forget that it's there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that machines do sometimes break down or go out of the running because of maintenance. The best way to avoid that impacting your workflow too much would be to have multiple smaller machines (though that's not your question now).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do you descale a Breville grind brew machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am getting a message on my coffee maker that it should be descaled. However, I can not figure out how to do it without the manual, which is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Citric acid isn't very effective, it's even weaker than vinegar. Sage (Breville's trade mark in the UK) advertises with a descaling powder containing sulfamic acid (see someone who figured this out on &lt;a href="https://coffeeforums.co.uk/topic/41932-so-you-think-sage-descaler-is-expensive/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a forum&lt;/a&gt;), which is a much stronger acid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weaker acids may be fine when they sit longer, for example when you're descaling the bottom of a kettle where the solution is in contact with the bottom for the duration of the descaling process. In more complicated espresso machines, you have tubes (metal or plastic) which may also have some deposits. Depending on the descaling process, the solution doesn't stay in those tubes very long, so you need to have a stronger solution that can clean the deposits there in that limited time window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also aftermarket products that contain this acid (in power or liquid form). On my local Amazon, the powder goes for about 10US$ per kg (2.2 lbs). You need to make sure your machine can handle these, I think the ones with a stainless steel boiler can (at least the more expensive Breville machines are stainless steel, not sure about the cheaper ones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've settled on using this acid, you need to figure out dosage. I'd recommend following the dosage of the aftermarket solution or Breville's own powder and following the descaling instructions that came with your machine (or by looking up the manual online).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How long is brewed coffee fresh for and what does that blinking light mean at Starbucks?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I asked a Starbucks barista what the blinking light is for on the brewed coffee and he said is starts blinking 15 minutes after the coffee is brewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes no sense to me as they would have to brew coffee 4 times an hour which they obviously do not do because it would be ludicrous.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The blinking light means it has been sitting there for 30 mins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starbucks Baristas do in fact brew coffee every 15 mins and are supposed to dump the coffee when the light blinks.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Should any coffee be extracted during pre-infusion?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Breville Express, 870XL I think, (single broiler, built in grinder). Lately during pre-infusion, a lot of coffee has been coming through before the pressure ramps up, while it's still low and in pre-infusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I put the grind size very fine (a 3 or 4 on the dial) I'll get less during pre-infusion, but even less during the real extraction and also it'll be sour or whatever; you can't taste the flavour of the coffee. This happens both with the single filter and double filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had the machine for 6 months. Surprisingly the descale light has never come on, so I've never descaled it. I'm trying to keep the grounds even and I use the razor to even out the ground at the end (I blow out excess grounds dug up by the razor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how to troublshoot this, beyond the different grind settings I tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I am manually tamping. It looks even when i tamp and I usually tamp as hard as i can without putting my body weight into it, then I use the razor. I try to dose enough, such that after i tamp, I can use the razor to clear off a little from the top, so I know it's even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible it's just the beans? This all started when I got new beans from a super highly rated cafe in San Fran, I think. They were already 3 weeks old when i bought them and it's been 2 weeks since then. I just didn't think it would matter for water going through pre-infusion... like how is there even enough water to go through the puck during pre-infusion, I assumed it would barely be enough to wet the puck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Using a fresh decaf bean now from Monogram and I'm having the same issue. It perplexes me that water flows through during pre-infusion and I ALSO still get espresso ranged pressure during the main extraction. Like, if water flows through with no pressure, then shouldn't it flow through faster with lots of pressure? Or instead shouldn't it be impossible to get high pressure, if water can flow through with no pressure? The physics of this whole thing confuses me.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As I said in a comment, I'll lay out a few factors that you need to experiment with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If I put the grind size very fine (a 3 or 4 on the dial) I'll get less during pre-infusion, but even less during the real extraction and also it'll be sour or whatever; you can't taste the flavour of the coffee. This happens both with the single filter and double filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is the first factor: &lt;strong&gt;grind size&lt;/strong&gt;. You can probably still tweak it a bit and you'll want to do so with the smallest step the machine allows. I don't know how many steps your machine has (my Oracle goes from 0 to 45, I think) and it allows a decent adjustment in grind size. It's not as good as a dedicated high-end espresso grinder, but it helps to to tune in the right direction pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're not extracting enough then you're grinding too fine or tamping too hard. So that's why I commented about &lt;strong&gt;tamping&lt;/strong&gt; which is the second factor. Those two are related, if you grind super find but tamp it only very lightly then you'll still get a full extraction. The trick is to find a balance between the two and that can change from one bean to another. So instead of taming harder on the coarser grind, you can also try a finer grind with a gentler tamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly the descale light has never come on, so I've never descaled it. I'm trying to keep the grounds even and I use the razor to even out the ground at the end (I blow out excess grounds dug up by the razor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is yet another factor. The &lt;strong&gt;razor&lt;/strong&gt; is probably good for reproducibility, assuming it doesn't ruin what remains in the filter. On the other hand, you might benefit from a bit more coffee in the basket, especially when you're using a slightly coarser grind. So this is also a factor to experiment with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there's the &lt;strong&gt;extraction time&lt;/strong&gt;. While it's often advised to have about 30 seconds of extraction time, it's certainly not set in stone. Too long and you may get a bitter cup and too short probably won't get enough volume in the cup (or not enough pressure) but it's something to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I've had ristrettos taking 40 to 45 seconds on a 1:1 ratio with a fine grind that were nice and sweet. Indeed, had I stopped those shots at 20 to 25 seconds then they would've been sour similar to your description of the very fine grind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would use a finer setting for the grounds, but my pressure after pre-inf is already very high. Like how is water flowing through the portafilter equally fast with and without pressure? I don't understand the physics of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reply to this comment, it depends on how your machine does pre-infusion. For example, the Oracle builds pressure normally but it has a relieve valve that you can set at a percentage of the normal / maximum pressure. The minimum for my setting is 55%, so it certainly builds some pressure during pre-infusion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the flow rate, it probably isn't flowing as much at the lower pressure. You could obviously compare the time and even compare with an empty basket, that'll flow a lot faster (at least on my machine it does).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I've had the machine for 6 months. Surprisingly the descale light has never come on, so I've never descaled it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's probably a good idea to descale regularly anyway. It depends on the hardness of your water, and it's probably not the culprit here, but I'd try to make it a habit to do at regular intervals (monthly, or bimonthly depending on water quality).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>coffee with cardamom</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently tried coffee with some cardamom spice which tasted really great. I'm still wondering if it has any negative impact on health if you drink a lot of cups of coffee with cardamom during the day. I usually add some spoons of brown sugar and sometimes even skimmed milk, in the end I add small spoon of ground cardamom and stirr it up. I use regular ground coffee from the supermarket and consume probably around 3-5 cups per day, should I consume less? Are there any food/drinks I should avoid after drinking coffee with cardamom?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;WebMD does list some negative side-effects when &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-614/cardamom" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;taking cardamom&lt;/a&gt;.  Looks like cardamom has health benefits too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have a suggestion (gleaned from the back of my jar of cardamom pods). Instead of using a spoonful of ground cardamom, consider getting cardamom pods, squeezing 2 or 3 of them to crack them a little bit and placing those in your coffee cup.  It definitely augments the taste of the coffee in the positive direction, plus you're not eating ground cardamom. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What does over-extracted taste like?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The recipe says to stir less if the coffee tastes over-extracted and to stir more if it tastes under-Extracted. Is this different from stonger and weaker? What does extraction taste like? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes, over- and underextracted are quite different from weak or strong coffee. The strength is determined by the amount of grounds, more grounds = stronger coffee. But that’s not what your recipe is talking about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preparing coffee is a physical and chemical process (although some aficionados will claim that it’s an art) where soluble compounds (“flavors”) are dissolved in water. The coffee bean contains various compounds that dissolve at different speeds, with acidic flavors being quickest and bitter notes, e.g. tannins slowest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without going into the details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An under-extracted coffee will be acidic, and missing the “fullness” from the coffee oils.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a just right extraction, acidity will be a side note to a full body of coffee oils and sugars with a bit of bitterness for balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An over-extracted coffee will be unpleasantly bitter, masking the desired flavors, and sometimes even with an astringent mouthfeel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beans, roast, grind size and brewing method are all parameters that influence the ratio of aromatic compounds and/or rate of extraction, but the principle described above remains. &lt;a href="https://clivecoffee.com/blogs/learn/how-coffee-extraction-works" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;clive Coffee&lt;/a&gt; has a neat blogpost on the topic and there’s even a Wikipedia article on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_extraction" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;coffee extraction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does breaching a stovetop milk steamer's double wall destroy it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a stovetop milk steamer &amp;amp; espresso maker whose handle fell off. The spot weld failed after a few years of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cAZLY.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cAZLY.jpg" alt="Stovetop milk steamer"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a TIG welder, I welded the handle's thread back to the lid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2gLrg.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2gLrg.jpg" alt="Detail of stovetop milk steamer&amp;#39;s handle weld joint"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, during the welding process I breached the double wall of the lid; a hole formed through which you could see the inside of the double wall. I filled in the hole and continued the weld as you can see from the photograph above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is this: &lt;strong&gt;can I put this steamer back into service or is it a writeoff&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To know the answer to that question I think I need to know what the nature of that void was before I breached the wall of the container?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was it a vacuum?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was it filled with a special gas?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was it just plain old air?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it was anything other than plain old air it's now filled with plain old air and a little bit of argon. All I really want to know is that it's not going to explode if I put it back into service.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The double wall on this steamer is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; there for insulation. That idea doesn't add up. An exterior wall will heat up before an interior wall if heated on a stovetop and would inhibit transfer of heat to the interior container...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of two possible reasons for the double wall, but I must say, that double wall is an unnecessary added expense on the unit no matter the reason it was included...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) In a double wall design, the exterior wall will cool down faster than a single wall would, since the exterior wall does not maintain contact with hot water. This means you can safely reuse the steamer sooner. This is kind of silly, though, since you can easily cool a single walled steamer by briefly running it under cold water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) A double walled steamer is more structurally durable than a single walled steamer. These units are sometimes built to withstand very significant internal pressure. The double wall could be part of such a design. This is kind of silly itself because steam pressure higher than a single walled unit could support is dangerous...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exterior wall in any case likely does not play any part in containing steam. To be sure, I'd need to see the inside of the lid. It depends whether the seal is placed on the outside threads or the inner vessel and whether a gasket is used or not.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Where are high-quality coffee beans harvested?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Which country produces high-quality coffee beans?  Are the tropical countries producers of high-quality coffee beans?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Many places with various climates do or could produce high quality beans. Guatemala, Peru, Ecuador,  Hawaii, Jamaica, Kenya, Indonesia... the list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee is a fruit, a sort of cherry that can grow in wet or dry, temperate or cool climates. The climate of a location and the specific times of planting and harvest will affect the flavor of the coffee bean itself (which is the seed of the fruit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are other factors that affect the flavor to greater degrees. How the seeds are processed (removal of the fruit and drying of the beans) after harvest is perhaps the biggest factor. Of course roasting, staleness of beans when brewing, and brewing factors all also play significant roles in the final taste of drinkable coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's close to impossible to control for all these factors. Specialty coffees can typically each be sourced to a single farm and a single harvest because that's the only way to ensure consistent processing of the beans. But even then, logistics of sourcing present challenges to consistently roasting and brewing those beans. And changing climates across the globe will challenge preconceived notions of "where the best coffee comes from" as we move into a bleak future.&lt;/p&gt;

It is safe and good for my body to drink coffee 10 times a day?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Caffeine content of coffee varies widely depending on many factors. How much caffeine does your 10 cups contain? And how much is too much? The Mayo Clinic website has addressed exactly what you are concerned about in their detailed article which can be read here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20045678" rel="noreferrer"&gt;https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20045678&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important extracts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How much is too much?
  Up to 400 milligrams (mg) of caffeine a day appears to be safe for most healthy adults. That's roughly the amount of caffeine in four cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of cola or two "energy shot" drinks. Keep in mind that the actual caffeine content in beverages varies widely, especially among energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;You may want to cut back if you're drinking more than 4 cups of caffeinated coffee a day (or the equivalent) and you're experiencing side effects such as:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Migraine headache&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Insomnia&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Nervousness&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Irritability&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Restlessness&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Frequent urination or inability to control urination&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Stomach upset&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Fast heartbeat&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Muscle tremors&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Most adults need seven to eight hours of sleep each night. But caffeine, even in the afternoon, can interfere with this much-needed sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Chronically losing sleep — whether it's from work, travel, stress or too much caffeine — results in sleep deprivation. Sleep loss is cumulative, and even small nightly decreases can add up and disturb your daytime alertness and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Using caffeine to mask sleep deprivation can create an unwelcome cycle. For example, you may drink caffeinated beverages because you have trouble staying awake during the day. But the caffeine keeps you from falling asleep at night, shortening the length of time you sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's also my personal experience as a long-time coffee 'addict', though I am also very sensitive to caffeine and therefore I can tolerate just 2 cups a day before I lose sleep and begin to experience strong physical effects. The key thing is to make sure you don't experience symptoms of caffeine excess, and that you get adequate sleep every day, which also varies from person to person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel the need to reduce your coffee intake, the same article linked above provides some useful guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;We can’t give you shopping advice, it will depend on your location through which channels you can obtain a replacement part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we can help you with is to determine what size of pot you have - and based on that, you can pick the correct size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, you can measure the diameter of the “no longer there” gasket, some web shops may actually list that value. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they simply sell by pot size, measure the amount of water that goes into the lower compartment. For my Bialetti models, the three-cup one takes about 140-150 ml, the six-cup around 300-310 ml. That translates to about 50 ml per cup (will be less after brewing, as some water will be absorbed by the grounds). &lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Is it hard to clean an Automated Expresso Machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I wonder about the expensive machines where you pour whole beans and water in the top and out of the bottom you get espresso, filtered coffee, or even a latte just by pushing a button. You would need to clean the bean chute, grinding area, milk frothing, and all the pathways connecting these parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you find it more inconvenient or time-consuming than just having separate grinder, espresso maker, and frothing wand? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The clear answer: It depends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, not all fully automatic models are constructed in the same way. Which also means the required effort varies between brands and models. Some are pretty self-cleaning, others less so. Checking consumer reviews on the usual shopping websites should give you a first idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, regular cleanup is non-negotiable. If you skip daily cleaning, your machine will become a breeding ground for mold and bacteria. If you doubt that, simply open the machine in an average office where everyone pulls a shot, but nobody bothers to do more than dump out the used grounds every now and then. Especially the brewing part and various pipes can turn you into a tea drinker at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course a two- or three-part setup of grinder, espresso machine and maybe frother must also be cleaned, but apart from the parts touching the milk, you deep-clean far less often (e.g. dismantling the grinder) or a quick rinse or wipe will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have to find your personal threshold for the covenience vs. effort question. The answer will depend on the machine model, but also on the kind of use the machine gets. For our household where we pull between (usually) two and (rarely) eight shots a day and only occasionally steam milk, we purposely picked separate items, but that was also based on counter space and kitchen layout and the charm and flexibility of “handmade” coffee&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. My parents decided that for about the same parameters an all-in-one machine was the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;————&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; We used to quite happily work with a Mokka before buying an espresso machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The well-known recipe for the ground coffee to coffee beverage ratio is around 1:20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One pound is equivalent of 453.6 grams. Therefore; you may expect to have 9072 grams of brewed beverage. When you assume that a cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; coffee beverage is around 1 grams, yo should have a bit more than 9 liters of beverage. Again, this makes around 320 oz. beverage. If you assume that your cups are 10 oz, &lt;strong&gt;you should end up with 32 cups of beverage from 1 pound of ground coffee&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I admit that, using such a unit system makes it way harder than stating "1 kg coffee ends up two hundred 100 ml cups", at once.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In case the question is relevant to the density of coffee:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Updated after Paul's comment)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is simpler as it depends solely on the density of coffee. Still, we may require a series of unit conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The density of ground coffee is around 0.32 gr/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This means, 453.6 grams (one pound) of coffee has a volume around 1.42 l. This volume is roughly 50 oz. Finally, a cup is 8 to 12 oz, let's say 10 oz on average. Therefore, a pound of coffee should be more or less 5 cups of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This density is for ground beans. Green coffee beans has a density around 0.56 gr/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much leverage pressure is it needed to compress coffee for an espresso?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Some espresso machines come with a lever to compact the ground coffee before the espresso starts the brewing, other machines do the compacting part by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much leverage or pressure is it required to make the coffee compact enough to go to the next step of brewing the espresso, and what happens if I put too much pressure (i.e equivalent to 1ton)? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Based on your comment on the question, you are referring to compacting ground coffee in the portafilter. This process is referred to as &lt;code&gt;tamping&lt;/code&gt; when making espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widely-accepted amount of downward force to use when tamping a standard double shot of espresso is 30 lbs. You can view a &lt;a href="https://ineedcoffee.com/espresso-tamping/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;source here&lt;/a&gt; but if you simply do a google search for "espresso tamping pressure" you will see 30 lbs mentioned ubiquitously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using a tamper directly on the coffee grinds, it is easy to practice putting down 30 lbs of force by practicing on a scale. If you are indeed using a &lt;strong&gt;lever&lt;/strong&gt; to do the tamping, I suggest reading the instructions that came with your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30 lbs of force on the lever may not result in 30 lbs of force on the espresso, depending on the setup of your machine. The lever may even be engineered specifically to stop tamping at 30 lbs. Tamping espresso with a lever setup can be a bit of controversial thing in the coffee world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever your setup, you want 30 lbs of downward force to result from whatever it is that contacts with the ground coffee and tamps it down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting too much force on the ground coffee is called over-tamping. The coffee grinds can become over-compacted which can slow down extraction (lead to over-extraction) of the espresso, lead to channeling (where water finds inconsistencies in the grind and channels through in small spots, leading to unequal extraction in the espresso puck), or even block it completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you used 1 ton of downward force when tamping, I suggest that you will likely break your portafilter and its basket, along with whatever is beneath it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Moka vs. pour-over oil extraction efficiency</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What are the differences in the coffee made from a moka pot vs. a pour-over? Does one extract more of the beans' oil than another?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Pourover methods tend to use a paper filter which prevents oils from flowing into the coffee. Pourover is also brewed at a low pressure and a higher coffee to water ratio, giving the coffee a gentler, tealike taste. Moka pots are closer to espresso in terms of intensity and pressure, and does have more body and a richer flavour. I personally prefer pourover coffee but everyone has their own tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are good ratios for cold brewing coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm using a mason jar + inserted filter method to brew cold brew concentrate. My normal method is 2L water per 110 grams of coffee, left in the fridge for 24 to 48 hours. Is this good for a concentrate or should I adjust my ratios/time/temperature? I've heard that room temperature is better, but I haven't seen anything to back that up. Seems like it would be better to maintain lower temp for bacteria. Any advice? &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I make a cup of coffee using coffee pods meant for a pod coffee machine, without one?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was recently gifted a couple different brands of coffee pods, and I don't really know what to do with them, since the coffee machines for them seem to be a bit pricey for a whimsical purchase. Is there a way to make a cup of coffee with these pods if I don't have a pod coffee machine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've looked it up and it seems that different pods (even within the same brand) are designed for different water volumes passing through them and at different temperatures, so if there are multiple recommended ways to brew them DIY-style, I'd like to know which method fits which the best. Maybe I could reverse-engineer the process a machine does and repeat it manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pods I have are labeled "Nescafe Dolce Gusto cafe? au lait" and "Starbucks Caffe? Verona". If manual method works out, I'm open to buying these pods separately, so methods for brewing other brands are also welcome :)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;For now I've been using single-use white paper filters for tea. I cut open the tops of the pods with an office paper knife and pour out the contents into the paper bag. Then I pour hot water into the bag while holding it directly over the cup, careful not to burn your fingers (maybe use kitchen clamps to hold the bag if it's too hot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I've seen in videos showing the disassembled insides of pod coffee maker machines, the contents of the pod don't really spend much time in contact with the water, so this method is a close enough approximation of how the machine works, and the resulting brew tastes good enough to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For illustration, here's an image of a tea filter. You can probably use coffee filters just as well if you have them, I just happened to already have tea filters at home and didn't feel like spending extra.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How does hard water affect the brew and how to compensate for hard water?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I figured the brewing technique that works for me at home. I am using light roasts, brew them with AeroPress using good amount of 95C water at about 1-to-8 ratio. Yet, when I come to my friends place, using exactly the same technique produces dull coffee, actual taste hides behind an overwhelming acidity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trial and error I figured, that water hardness is drastically different at our places: after a single boiling of water my teapot would have as much lime residue as my friend's teapot would after a month of active usage. Lime would be visible on mine immediately, while the other teapot would remain mirror-clean for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would not be able to get better water in my house without signifficant investments. But, what can I do get approximately same coffee when I switch to lighter water? Can I remedy that by water temp, blooming, ratio etc.?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way. When I lower the temp of water coffee comes out weak and, somehow, oily.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Water is complex in terms of coffee, and the answer is "it depends" in terms of how it will affect your coffee. Every coffee roaster tastes their coffee with a certain water, and it's likely the coffee tastes best with the water it was roasted against. You might experience the opposite problem from what you described with some roasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple things you'll want to account for. There are many undesirable flavors you can get from heavy metals, or chlorine-tasting water (so at a minimum you want your water to taste good). Beyond that, you really care about the amount of Calcium, Magnesium, and buffer (generally HCO3) in your water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on what you said of your water, I suspect you have quite a bit more bi-carbonate hardness (HCO3 or buffer) in your water. This kind of hardness will rip out the acids in the coffee very well, but will also push the pH level of the final cup to a balanced state. Your friend's water likely lacks enough to bring the coffee's pH to a balanced state where it's enjoyable (fun hack, add ~2g/L of baking soda to water, a source of bi-carbonate, and add this in increments to the final coffee, you can fix the acidity!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calcium and Magnesium also work together to bring out acids and other taste-y bits to your coffee. Calcium + Bi-carbonate is why your kettle is scaling quickly. You can filter your water (a cheap Brita filter will remove Ca and Mg from your water). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally mix my water up from distilled for brewing to a specific ppm of Ca, Mg, and Bi-carbonate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can increase your total hardness of water if you get a better system by simply adding baking soda to the water, or other mineral salts. I would be careful about this however and ensure you are still creating something that is safe to drink. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want measure your water, you can use various titration kits to quantify your house water. If you want to do more research on water and coffee, &lt;a href="https://eustore.sca.coffee/products/book-water-for-coffee?_pos=15&amp;amp;_sid=a35b576e2&amp;amp;_ss=r&amp;amp;variant=5081224388" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the popular book on it. It's very hard to find, I got lucky enough to pick up a copy. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it possible to grind then roast?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to grind green coffee beans, then roast the grinds, and make a good cup of coffee with the result? Are there reasons why doing so would be impossible or impractical or would necessarily result in a bad cup of coffee? Has it ever been tried?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is entirely a curiosity of mine, but I could imagine some benefits of making coffee in this way. For example, the roasting time may be much faster than traditional roasting, perhaps making the process of home-roasting more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;No. Unroasted coffee beans are denser and wetter than roasted beans and will not grind well. You will break your grinder trying, and even if the grinder succeeded, you'd get more of a mush than solid grinds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, roasting ground green coffee would allow much more of the oils and gasses trapped in the coffee to leak out during roasting than even the driest roast. The resulting coffee would taste strange.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does a coffee pad machine make such a smooth delicious coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In an amateur capacity I have been interested in (as everyone here surely is also) trying to make the perfect cup of coffee/espresso. I have tried all kinds of coffee making process, Moka pot coffee, espresso machines, drip coffee, French press. As well as trying various professional barista type establishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quite accidentally discovered coffee pad machines, such as the one made by Senseo:
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1B7Kt.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1B7Kt.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it, to my taste, produces the smoothest least sour/bitter coffee I have tasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is: Why?
I am curious as to the chemical and physical processes that make coffee prepared in this way so smooth. I realise this is of course subjective. My own pallet comes into play, the type of coffee pads I use and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question: Is this a "true" espresso?
It seems unlikely to me that these types of machine can produce the types of pressure seen in the more traditional espresso machines. It produces a crema, but I suspect that this is artificial from aeration, similar to how some of the cheaper espresso basket systems have an actual aerator in the basket to produce the appearance of a crema.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone had a similar reaction to this type of coffee preparation method? I find it some what ironic that with all the science that goes into coffee preparation -- especially in the context of espresso -- that this simple thing -- for me -- makes the best cup of coffee&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The appeal of espresso is the ability to extract, using high pressure, lots of oil within the coffee itself. That isn't easily achieved with any other type of machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for low pressure you can have filtered (anything with paper in between you and the beans), unfiltered (without paper), poured (think drip filter) and full immersion (french press).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The senseo is using a paper filter, removing more oils from the coffee than without a filter and not allowing any "fines" very small coffee particles into the cup. It uses only moderate pressure and it is extracting rather fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So these are the variables that seem to create a smooth cup for you. I suggest looking up (or trying) what different extraction durations do to the taste, as well as what the grind size and filter will achieve, both things taht could fill pages ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can I use cocoa-dusted coffee in my moka pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a 3-cup Bialetti Moka Express pot and some coffee beans dusted with cocoa powder that I bought from a chocolate shop. My French press is stuck at work due to the quarantine, so I can't use them up the way I have been. I also have a Chemex carafe and set of filters, but I fear that the Chemex filters will take out all of the cocoa powder, defeating the purpose of the beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried using these beans in my moka pot twice at this point. Both times resulted in the pot sputtering a lot and brewing very slowly, rather than filling the reservoir in a quick burst like it does with regular coffee. My first attempt it was extremely slow, but I chalked that up to a too-fine grind playing badly with the extra difficulty of cocoa powder. My second attempt used a coarser grind, and it seemed to brew more quickly, but the top of the moka pot was not at the usual level it is when I use plain coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will using cocoa-powdered coffee in my moka pot cause any permanent damage to the internal workings, or do I just need to make sure I wash all the cocoa powder out between uses?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If the cocoa powder is ground up cocoa bean withou added sugar/milk etc. I can't see any issue.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Spots on Moka Pot, I suspect they are mold</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have this Bialetti Moka pot for over a year. I wasn't using it very frequently until a couple of months ago. Now I use it almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think in last December, I made coffee and forget to remove the old coffee from the funnel and noticed it after one week. I cleaned it immediately with detergent and even rubbed it with a dishwashing brush... Then I made coffee again and it smelled horrible, like I wasn't able to remove all the leftover coffee. I noticed that some coffee was actually in the filter and I put one of the hairs of the brush inside every hole to get rid of the old coffee residues. Some of them were attached to each other with mold. It was a terrible experience to clean it, it took more than one hour. Then I brewed 2-3 times and throw away the coffee I made, just to make sure everything is actually cleaned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also noticed these spots at this incident. I am not sure if they were there before. I did some research on how to get rid of these spots and realised I shouldn't be cleaning the pot with soap... I don't use soap anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/afYIT.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/afYIT.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know what these spots are. I couldn't get rid of them and I thought maybe it is just oxidation. I still use the pot and coffee tastes normal, as it should be, but rarely I still get the smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to get rid of these spots? How can I make sure that they are really oxidation? Should I keep using it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;After the first instance of boiling the water in the bottom part, any mold will be dead. Using a soft brush will easily remove it. So this looks like oxidation damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the smell, the filter basket has a layer with holes in it, the underside of which is very hard to clean as you have to get to through the funnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I suspect the top part. There is a filter and a rubber seal. Remove the seal and clean the "hidden" part of the top filter as well as the the area all the way up. The rubber seal is very likely to have picked up a bad odour. This happens quite often when the moka pot  was too hot and burned the seal, making subsequent cups taste (and smell) like burnt rubber. These rubber seals are cheaply available as a replacement part.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can I brew espresso with 14g portafilter basket?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Being a complete novice, I've been struggling to brew something that looks like proper espresso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My machine (Ascaso Dream PID) came with 14 gram portafilter basket (58mm in diameter). Several sources have told me that I really should dose according to the dose label on my basket - no more than +/- 1 gram. I have tried to brew with 14 grams of coffee, but have failed miserably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My shots always run too fast and the taste is pretty light and sour (underextracted?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have pushed my grinder (Baratza Sette 270Wi) to the smallest possible grind-size, but it's still too fast. Though at these smallest sizes it's getting pretty tricky to keep the water running evenly through the pack. Again, various sources have told me that I shouldn't go too fine with my grind. The manual of my grinder suggests starting with grind setting 7E for espresso. At that setting with 14 grams of coffee I'm getting a 30g shot in 16 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have experimented with various ways of getting my tamping as consistent and level as possible. My current tamping process as follows: knock the portafilter several times against table to level off the initial pile of grains, spin the leveling tool, press down firmly with tamper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have fiddled a bit around with pressure. Haven't gone out of the 8..11 bar range. As expected I get a little longer shots with 8 bar. Mostly I've tried to settle to using 9.5 bars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haven't yet tried changing water temperature - it's been 93 degrees C.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've tried with a 2 second pre-infusion and without. Not much of a difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's worth mentioning that my timings are measured from pulling the lever - but it takes at least 5 seconds for the first drips to appear (about 9 seconds with pre-infusion).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also worth mentioning is that I'm getting lots of variation from shot to shot with exactly the same settings. Like 31g shot in 22 seconds, and then 34g shot in 17 seconds. This seems to happen more when I go to these finer grind sizes. I suspect uneven extraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have also used 3 different types of coffee beans. No real difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the smallest possible grind size, 8 bar pressure and 15g coffee I've managed to get 31g shot in 27 seconds. But it tasted very underextracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best results I've had have been when I've increased dose to 17..18 grams. Then I'm able to also use courser grinds. With these doses I'm finally getting some more crema and the taste is no more watery. Though my basket is pretty-much overflowing at such a large dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the espresso-making tutorials I've seen always tend to deal with 18 gram or larger baskets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, is there hope in brewing espresso with 14 gram basket (and what should I change)?&lt;/strong&gt;
Or should I get myself a 18 gram basket and move on (my portafilter seems to have enough room to put a larger basket in).&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Turned out that the problem was in my grinder which failed to grind fine enough. After reading the online grinder manual (which unfortunately wasn't included with the grinder itself) I discovered the following section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first few pounds of coffee, the grind produced at the lowest setting may not be fine enough for espresso. To shift the grind range finer, a small washer (included) can be installed below the cone burr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing the extra washer, all my problems went away.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can you make good, evenly extracted espresso with a single basket?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Lelit espresso machine which came, like nearly all other machines, with multiple baskets. I got a double (up to 20g), a small double (up to 18g) and a single (up to 9g) basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine lets me brew phenomenally delicious espresso with the large double basket, which has straight walls and lets the water flow through the coffee evenly. The espresso has a really nice texture, it's neither sour nor bitter, perfectly balanced, very sweet and just very enjoyable in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single and the small double baskets however only have holes in the middle and are kind of shaped like a funnel. I understand the purpose of this shape, it's to slow the water down so you get similar extraction times with the same grind setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the past few weeks I tried to use the single baskets exclusively to see if I can make single shots instead of having to drink a doppio every time. I have tried adjusting a lot of factors and could not get an espresso that was as good as with the double basket. I tried adjusting temperature, pump pressure, grind size, tamping pressure, and extraction ratio. I have tried using 7,8, and 9 grams of coffee with a brew ratio of 1.8 to 2.5 and none of them were as good as with the double basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what I tried, the espresso always had that channeling taste. It was sour and bitter at the same time. Inspecting the pucks afterwards showed no clear sign of channeling most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this frustrating ordeal I just went back to using the double basket, which clearly makes better espresso (I even did a blind test to see if I can tell the difference, I got 4 out of 4 right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are single baskets just not made for specialty coffee? Does the funnel shape cause circulation at the edges and therefore higher extraction at the edges compared to the middle of the puck? Is it possible to get an espresso from a single basket that is as delicious as one made with a double basket? If not, can I buy a single basket that has the same shape as a double basket but with room for less coffee? I'm already pretty close to the finest grind setting on my grinder so I'm scared that using less coffee would make it flow faster than I can counteract with grinding finer.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes. If you're willing to accept a bit of increased workflow hassle, the La Marzocco 7g basket with an inner straight-walled cylindrical bit (or one of its derivatives) works very well. To use this, you only fill the inner bit (with 6-8 grams) and tamp with a 41mm tamper. When properly dialled in, the basket yields a single that's quite close to, if not indistinguishable from, a split double in terms of taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downsides of this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While not strictly required, a special funnel to fill in the inner bit is practically necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring proper distribution of grounds in the basket is a challenge; some form of WDT seems to be necessary with most grinders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can't use the same tamper for singles and doubles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small dose is very sensitive to small variations; weighing each shot is practically necessary in my experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the shot's been pulled, there will be not a puddle but a &lt;em&gt;pool&lt;/em&gt; of water on top of the puck. Easy enough to flip and drain into the drip tray, but forget to do this right after the shot, and you'll be left with a soupy mess in the portafilter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The inner cylindrical bit only holds up to about 8g of coffee. With some coffees, this may force a grind size that's too fine and lead to bitterness. I find the LM single basket to be ideal for classical Italian espresso blends designed for smaller doses, but less ideal for third wave coffee. (I wish someone made a 10g LM-style single!)&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Least Expensive Way to Make Decent Espresso-based Milk Drinks?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I want to know the cheapest machines to make decent espresso for my situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need steam for milk drinks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need the proper brewing pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to use fresh ground coffee, no pods nonsense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No super-automatics that deal with the milk, I like that myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want a good temperature control, but I also don't really drink straight espresso, so 212F made espresso will not be that different to me than 200F made espresso.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guages would be great, especially in lever machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semi-automatic (by which I mean make a puck in the portafilter, turn water on/off, turn steam on/off) would be great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-Issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't care how fussy or slow it is. I can and will spend time to learn the machine and will wait for it to be ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am not super into tasting espresso like one does wine or whiskey, I really just want to be able to make a decent latte without hoofing it to a cafe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I live alone, I don't need to make more than a double shot at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If only after Latte, Bialetti Brikka will get you 9/10. Also the grinder will be a bit less demanding.
Add an induction milk frother (stainless cup) and you're set at a fraction of the cost and maintenance needs of a portafilter machine.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Blond flakes in espresso grounds</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My wife bought espresso beans for baking chocolate muffins (Unicorn Blood, chosen because of the cute label), so we ended up with most of a bag to be used for drip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I grind the beans, there are blond flakes in the grind, as if someone dusted the grounds and kitchen counter with the remains at the bottom of a Corn Flakes box. The whole beans look uniformly dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What causes the blond highlights in the grounds? Are they associated with a different taste or condition of the beans?  (The coffee I've made with the beans tastes dark, a bit malty or woody, like chicory, but not bitter.)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think you're talking about &lt;a href="https://www.wakacoffee.com/blogs/coffeepedia/what-is-coffee-chaff" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;coffee bean chaff&lt;/a&gt;, it's &lt;a href="https://zenroast.co/blog/2017/10/05/coffee-chaff/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pictured after roasting in this blog&lt;/a&gt;. These are blonde flakes the come off the beans during the roasting process. In most commercially sold coffee I've seen, the chaff has been removed. When I roasted my own coffee I didn't bother because it's not so easy to separate them from the beans and they are harmless (at least for brewing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your case, it seems some of the chaff was still stuck on the beans after roasting, but it came off when grinding the beans. I wouldn't worry about it too much for brewing coffee, but if you want to use the ground beans in another dish, it might be better to use a sieve to strain the chaff.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>When making pour over coffee, why does it sometimes take a very, very long time to drip out of the filter?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I regularly make coffee using a ceramic #2 Melitta-style cone and natural brown filters. Most of the time it works great and consistently makes delicious coffee. But every now and then, the coffee takes a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; long time to drip through the filter and out of the cone. More specifically, it normally takes a few minutes for it to fully drip out after pouring on the water, but in these cases it takes in excess of ten minutes. If I lift up the cone, I can see it's only letting out around one drip per second. I often have to apply gentle pressure to the filter to get it to actually drip out the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't found any rhyme or reason as to why this is happening -- changing the size of the ground doesn't help nor does changing to a different coffee. The only thing I haven't changed is trying out a different brand of coffee filters. Could this just be inconsistencies in the production of the filters themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The problem could very well be what Stephie was touching on; very fine coffee dust restricting the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was having the same issue with my setup and was just going to live with it. That is, until I took off the hopper off of my grinder and saw really finely ground coffee stuck between the splines of the burrs. After brushing out the powder and a couple firm taps it was back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the different beans along with their level of oil, grinds can build up on the the burrs and internals of the grinder rather quickly. After a bit of time the caked on and powdered grounds give way and fall down into the stuff you just grounded. When you try to brew a cup, the smaller lighter coffee grinds/dust flow down to the surface of the filter restricting the flow by blocking all of it's pores.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Tea vs. coffee paper filters: are they interchangeable?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I consider using paper bags for tea as a substitute for paper coffee filters and I wonder: do they filter out as much solid material as coffee filters? The matter of fact is that not all paper filters for coffee are identical: some have smaller pores, others have larger ones. Larger pores allow more oils to leak into a cup, it makes a beverage of richer flavor, but does it not make it cloudy as well? And if all paper tea filters are identical, do I have to expect cloudy coffee strained through them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P. S. What I was going to do with tea bags is either fill them with ground beans and submerge in water or filter brewed coffee through them leaving the grounds on the bottom of the vessel used for brewing. I wasn't going to use tea bags with a pour-over device.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As you've mentioned coffee and tea paper filters tend to vary in size and in pore size. You can use them for both, but I would expect different results. When I used to camp I would use individual paper tea bags that are intended to be filled with loose tea and filled them with coffee grinds. The result was better than using packages of instant coffee but it was definitely a weaker tasting coffee after steeping in hot water than I experience running coffee through a machine or French Press at home.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why are Costa or Starbucks lattes so good?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I’m a coffee addict and I have been always having Starbucks as well Costa. I just love their lattes , but it become too expensive over time, so I am on a road to discover how to make coffee like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have tried so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have tried &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nespresso-Essenza-Coffee-Machine-Krups/dp/B01MZANEBC/ref=asc_df_B01MZANEBC/?tag=googshopuk-21&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=218874155895&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=6202182703342439436&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9046629&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-420187831346&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nespresso&lt;/a&gt; machine (problem is the pods are stored for ages which make coffee loose its flavour),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;French press (feel too watery) and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milk instant coffee (where it is full cup of milk with one spoon of instant coffee)(which feels too heavy) or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instant coffee (which feels fake like boiled water).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am tired of all so these failed attempts, so I go to Costa everyday and I always have a latte. There’s something about them that make coffee so good and alive.
How can I get that without being too expensive? But without compromising on taste? In short, why do those coffee shops have such amazing coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm not familiar with Costa, but I am with Starbucks. Let me offer my ideas in what's different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starbucks stores use fully automatic espresso machines with semi automatic frothing wands. The espresso machines make true espresso, unlike all of the brewing options you mentioned. This is the main reason the coffee is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frothing wand also uses steam to froth the milk which creates a wonderfully creamy texture in the milk. Stick and pitcher frothers can't make the performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also grind. Starbucks stores use high quality coffee grinders that grind the coffee quite consistently. Coffee used for espresso is ground on demand for each shot. Your coffee at home might suffer if you're not grinding right before your brew or if you're grinding with a lower quality grinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, drink recipes. Starbucks cups are printed with volume markers to help baristas match recipes exactly. When you buy a latte at Starbucks, the ratio of espresso to milk is ideal and is the same every time. Unless you're measuring at home and know what that ideal ratio is, you're likely not hitting the right recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get coffee shop type lattes at home, you need a real espresso machine. A single boiler unit with a steam wand will do the trick, but nothing short of one will.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Home Roasting beginner green bean suggestions for learning?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Brand new to stack exchange and I am learning to roast coffee at home. I am wondering if there is an ideal or recommended coffee bean that is great for learning the basics? I understand this may be reduced to personal preference. I usually drink Italian dark roasted beans for espresso but I'm open to more exotic flavors. I'm trying to narrow my focus for learning purposes so I can really develop a sense of how the process works regarding one specific kind of bean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference:
I am using a JIAWANSHUN Home Roaster as &lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q3KZ5G6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;seen here on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I have roasted beans from Guatemala and Ethiopia purchased from Martini Coffee Imports as seen &lt;a href="https://www.martinicoffee.com/green-coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to narrow my focus for learning purposes so I can really develop a sense of how the process works regarding one specific kind of bean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a good way to start to learn the basics of your roaster, but keep in mind that other roasters will roast the bean differently, especially a tumble or hot air &amp;quot;popcorn&amp;quot; roaster. You'll learn more about the characteristics of that one bean, rather than how to judge the differences in roasts. To truly understand the roasting process, you need see the common events in different beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest learning about roasting by trying several beans to the same roast level. Each will take different times to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get an Ethiopian, a Central/South American, a Sumatran, and a decaf (Brazil SWP!!) and roast 1/4 lb (125-135 g) lots to end of 1st crack or start of 2nd crack. Take notes on how they behave: time to start of 1st crack, time to start of 2nd crack, do I like the taste of the results, color change versus time, amount of chaff. Enjoy the results, a different cup every morning.
Then take them to the middle of 2nd crack. With fire extinguisher at the ready, take them to end of 2nd crack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All beans roast differently, even under identical roaster settings. Next year, the same source bean will be slightly different. Some beans are great 30 s after start of 1st crack and others are terrible (Sumatran need to be dark, IMHO, otherwise you get too much &amp;quot;earth&amp;quot;). Some need full city or beyond. A few make a great cup anywhere from 1st crack through 2nd crack with different flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What manual grinders are good</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I already have an old &lt;a href="https://www.rok.coffee/uk/grindergc" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;rok grinder&lt;/a&gt; and I want to upgrade it, but I am not sure what manual grinders are good. The characteristics that I am looking for are mainly: Consistency of grains and general durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most grinders has the handle at top and when grinding it causes inconsistency of grains. For example in all Hario grinders you will see some grain too fine and others too coarse, you can even move the bottom part of the mill sideways with your hand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One flaw of rock grinder is a part near the bottom made of plastic (at least in old models), its function is to move the grains while grinding. In my case it broke after a few weeks of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methods in which I usually brew coffee are: Chemex, v60 and woodneck. Some times I also brew in aeropress, eva-solo and ibrik. So it is needed coarse grinding for eva-solo and very fine grinding for ibrik&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why is tamping necessary for espresso machines but not mokas?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Why is tamping necessary for espresso machines but not mokas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingston's &lt;a href="https://isidore.co/calibre#panel=book_details&amp;amp;book_id=7842" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Make Coffee: The Science Behind the Bean&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on how to use a moka, says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill the funnel with enough finely ground coffee so that it forms a rounded dome. Tap the funnel on the counter to even out the grounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without tamping&lt;/strong&gt; or compressing, make sure that the rubber gasket is in place and then screw the top half of the macchinetta onto the pot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Espresso machines rely on pressure to extract coffee solutes over a very short (~25 seconds) extraction time. Tamping is a critical aspect to achieving this. By tamping ideally, you eliminate channels by which water might pass through the grounds. Elimination of those channels is important for two reasons. First, channels mean that water only touches some of the grounds but not most, meaning you get very little coffee extracted. Second, tamping evenly forces water to travel through the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; bed of grounds; this is a critically important aspect to how the machine builds pressure. If channeling is present, water will simply drip through the grounds. You will not get 9-12 bars of pressure (or anywhere near that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moka pots are different because they build pressure below. Water is heated in the bottom chamber where it rises to dampen the bottom layer of grounds in the basket above. Because the moka pot doesn't use a pump, it requires steam to build up to create pressure. The pot is designed with a certain volume of space between the water reservoir and the grounds basket to facilitate this. If you tamp, you create resistance that the steam pressure might not be able to penetrate--at least not without causing an explosion of grounds and forcing a lot grounds up into the top chamber and making your brew sludgy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a moka pot filtered the coffee, something else bad could happen if you tamp. If there were a filter above the grounds, the aforementioned upward explosion of grounds caused by excessive pressure buildup would push grounds up into the filter, clogging the filter. This could cause the filter to get clogged. Best case, a steam outlet valve lets out the excess pressure and your brew is just ruined. Worst case, the steam outlet valve could get clogged and your pot could explode. Basically, even with completely effective safety features and special filtering features, tamping a moka pot would make it impossible to achieve a consistent brew because the amount of clogging of the filter would cause pressure during brewing to vary unpredictably. This isn't a problem with espresso because with espresso, a pump pushes the water through and because the machine itself controls the temperature of the water.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Delonghi Magnifica ESAM3500: Undocumented Wash Menu Option</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've had this machine for about 3 years and I just noticed a Menu entry called &amp;quot;Wash&amp;quot;

&lt;p&gt;This option is not documented anywhere in the manual, I tried searching the net without finding any concrete answer or even vague references to this option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's supposed to wash?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What detergent should be used?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it should be run?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I just ran the WASH cycle (without detergent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of notes and observations for the record:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Took about 15 minutes to run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would &amp;quot;brew&amp;quot; about 150ml of water every few minutes until the tank is emptied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once emptied it would not perform a rinse cycle with an additional tank like DESCALE does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the lack of a rinse cycle I suspect that whatever detergent it wants, it probably has to be poured using the pre-ground opening on the top unless you like  detergent-flavored coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I STRONGLY ADVICE AGAINST ADDING DETERGENTS TO THE TANK&lt;/strong&gt; when using this function, at least until we find out how to correctly using this function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="https://www.fixya.com/support/t8367106-delonghi_esam6600_wash" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this fixya link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, the wash programs does a high tech cleaning of the machine. You should use coffee machine cleaners like Cafiza, Puro Caff or Joe Glo. The detergent should be poured using the pre-ground hole at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a bottle of Cafiza and poured about a spoonful through the pre-ground chute and ran the WASH cycle, photo below shows what was coming out (I had already emptied the glass jar once, what initially came out was plainly gross I should have taken pictures). It's surprising considering that I had disassembled and cleaned the entire brew unit 2 days ago in order to replace an aging o-ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AXALa.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AXALa.jpg" alt="a photo of a pyrex bowl containing dark brown, foaming water" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it was done, I took out the brew unit, rinsed it with water just in case and brewed and discarded one coffee. After that I brewed a new coffee and it definitely tastes better now, less acidic and more &amp;quot;round&amp;quot; around the edges. I'm using a custom blend of 78% Brasil Santos + 22% Colombia beans made by my friend.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Shiny vs opaque looking beans</title>

&lt;p&gt;Being a curious mind I found that shine is a byproduct of higher temperature (read quicker) roast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I went googling to see how it impacts brew quality and found several conflicting answers. What's the community opinion on this? Do slow-roast beans produce a better quality or does it not matter?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h2&gt;Oily surfaces are related to roast level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think oily beans are related to roasting time as you say in your question. Instead, oily beans are characteristic of a darker roast. Roasting levels are primarily related to the internal temperature of the beans, the higher the internal temperature of the bean, the darker the roast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_roasting#Roasts" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has an overview of different roast levels. Three of the roast levels in their overview mention an oils on the surface of the beans (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;225 °C (437 °F), Full City Roast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium-dark brown with &lt;strong&gt;dry to tiny droplets or faint patches of oil&lt;/strong&gt;, roast character is prominent. At the beginning of second crack, body is fully developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;230 °C (446 °F), Vienna Roast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderate dark brown with &lt;strong&gt;light surface oil&lt;/strong&gt;, more bittersweet, caramel flavor, acidity muted. In the middle of second crack. Any origin characteristics have become eclipsed by roast at this level&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;240 °C (464 °F), French Roast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark brown, &lt;strong&gt;shiny with oil&lt;/strong&gt;, deep caramel undertones, acidity diminished. At the end of second crack. Roast character is dominant, little of the inherent aroma or flavors of the coffee remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia doesn't list the oily surface explicitly for the darkest roast: the Italian roast. Instead, it just describes it as &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;nearly black and shiny&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Nevertheless, the Italian roast has a very oily surface, as described by this &lt;a href="https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/blog/2009/05/20/italian-roast-vs-french-roast/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;article form Seattle Coffee Gear&lt;/a&gt; which compares the French and the Italian roast levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we know that there are die-hard devotees of dark roasted coffee and we were recently asked what the difference was between French Roast and Italian Roast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're both roasted quite darkly, so that they have an oily sheen to them after the roasting process is complete. With a French Roast, the temperature of the roast is high enough that these oils are brought to the surface and will impart a roasted flavor to the produced coffee or espresso. Aromas can vary from berry to citrus. Italian Roast is much darker and oilier than a French Roast and often preferred in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oily vs. non-oily beans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think it makes sense to say that one is better than the other. In comparing the two, I think it's better look at light vs. dark roasts because there are more factors at play. As a general rule I would say that the darker the roast, the more prominent the roast profile becomes over the origin characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another note about oily beans is that they can &lt;a href="https://espressocanada.com/blogs/news/how-oily-coffee-beans-can-ruin-your-espresso-machine-and-coffee-taste" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;leave more residue&lt;/a&gt; in your grinder (and other parts of the machine where the beans pass through).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Fine ground coffee and a french press</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am a beginner who just has been curious on making his own coffee. My mistake is that I didn't thoroughly research on what ground of coffee beans I should have and unfortunately had a fine ground coffee. I researched what I can in the internet and it seems possible to use a fine ground coffee for a french press. My questions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a good extraction time? I could experiment on this but an advice is greatly appreciated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many table spoon of fine ground coffee for a 600 ML french press?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Your biggest issue with a fine grind will be getting the plunger to press down.&lt;br /&gt;
The two tried &amp;amp; tested methods are to push/pull the plunger &amp;amp; see if you can force it without breaking the glass; the other is to take the top off, give it a good stir &amp;amp; try to press it immediately, before it has chance to float into a solid brick again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest is entirely up to you &amp;amp; how you like your coffee. Nominal time is 4 minutes. No-one can tell you how strong you like your coffee. I've seen people make it so thin it's more golden than brown &amp;amp; others so strong that light won't pass through a glass espresso cup.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I brew Vietnamese Coffee in a phin filter without getting too watered down?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;How do I brew Vietnamese Coffee without it tasting too watered down? I'm using a phin filter, but I can't get the coffee to be strong as I typically get at the restaurants. I tried applying more pressure to the coffee grounds to slow down the drip and less finely ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In my experience, it works well with a phin, if you grind the beans as for filter coffee, use two heaped tea-spoons and moderately press down the metal plate with the holes. And a good quality of the beans helps.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I improve my French press coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My housemate and I are currently using a French press to make coffee. I am not the best at making coffee with a French press, to say at least. I feel like my coffee always turns out watery and either too strong or not strong enough. Even if I follow the exact steps he does.
We use coarsely ground coffee (from a grinder/beans), stir after pouring hot water over the coffee, let it sit for ca. 4 min. and then slowly press it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I somehow improve this process? Are there any tips and tricks besides the coffee grind on how the coffee comes out stronger but less sour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to switch to a DeLonghi espresso machine. But my housemate swears that French press coffee has better quality, so alternatively - are there any facts to convince him to switch?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;To get consistent results, you should have consistent steps. Specifically, I'd pay attention to these four factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brew ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brew temperature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brew time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grind size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I aim for a brew ratio of 1:15 measured by weight (so I'd add 750 grams of water to 50 grams of coffee). This is mostly because it's easy to calculate and you can of course choose a slightly different ratio if you like a stronger or weaker cup. I'd say anywhere between 1:13 to 1:18 is fine, but you'll want to keep track of the ratio you're using so you can reproduce it consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for brew temperature, I think you should aim to start as hot as possible. For me that means preheating the brewing vessel with water that's just off the boil (as in, it has stopped boiling by the time I've taken it to the French press, no need to wait). So you fill the French press with hot water just to heat it (I add about 200 mL for an 800 mL beaker) and then you discard it (or use it to heat the cups) just before you add the grinds. The water you use for brewing may be just off the boil as well, but if you took it for preheating like a minute ago (but not much longer) and you don't feel like getting it to a boil again then that's fine too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for brew time, I would increase the time to 6-9 minutes. The added brew time should benefit the result. See also the linked video below which recommends 4+5= 9 minutes of total brewing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grind size doesn't have to be super coarse, just not so fine as to clog the filter. In his video, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/st571DYYTR8?t=101" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;James Hoffmann recommends a medium grind&lt;/a&gt;, that's a bit ambiguous but he uses it to steer people away from the often recommended (super) coarse. I'd say, if you keep all the other parameters as I described and the cup is still to weak, then go finer incrementally until you like it keeping all the other factors the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've recommended that linked video to others before, but in hindsight I think he's taking some unnecessary steps. For example, he scoops off some grinds and he doesn't plunge down past the surface of the coffee with the idea that more fines will have sunk to and remain at the bottom and the filter acts as a strainer when you pour it (rather than when you push down). I guess the technique is worth trying if you're still experimenting but it's a bit too much of a hassle for my taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you do plunge down, you may want to keep the filter just above most of the sunk coffee, that way you can pour it easily but you don't disturb the sediment more than you have to.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it safe to deburr a Moka pot with a file</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a 3 cup aluminum bialetti that I've had for a year.  One thing that bothers me is that there are burrs around the edges on the upper section that trap coffee and are hard to clean.  I have some fine needle files that could take care of it, but I don't know if there is any plating that I would be removing if I were to file it.  I'm also thinking about filing down the partial thread as it's gotten pretty damaged and is a little gritty.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It’s safe as far as material is concerned: Aluminum is typically not coated, it forms its own protective layer of aluminum oxide pretty much as soon as the bare metal is exposed to oxygen and water (both available in air).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would however be careful with everything that could affect the “grip” of the threads. Remember that the water chamber is pressurized when heated and you want to be very sure that the seal isn’t compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

But what about cold brewed coffee concentrate?  Given that cold brew is already at fridge temperature, it seems like I ought to be able to freeze it without changing it much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can freeze it, what steps should I take to preserve flavor through freezing and thawing, and why?  If I can't freeze it, why not?  What happens?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can freeze cold brew. There was a time in my life when I did exactly that. I prepared cold brew in a large batch, then, each day before work, I filled a stainless steel water bottle and stuck that in the freezer overnight. Next day, the bottle would go straight to the fridge at work in the morning, and by lunchtime I'd have drinkable, iced cold brew. Worked great. I did this for about two years and never had an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need to take any unusual steps. Use a fully enclosed container to prevent sublimation of water (ice). Any kind of bottle or jar that can safely handle liquid expansion during freezing is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the most basic everyday tool for coffee roasting?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;If someone were to try to roast their own beans (in small batches) for the first time, what are the everyday/common household tools that works for this and how did you do it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The most important thing for roasting is the heat source. You cannot roast without heat and the type of heat source will influence the result of the roast. For home roasting, I can think of two obvious heat sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An oven, though this requires some additional material. To use this method you need something to hold the coffee. You'd want the heat to be distributed evenly, but that's quite hard unless you have something so the beans move around while roasting. I've tried home roasting with stainless steel mesh dishes so the heat can move around the beans with the fan providing the most air circulation my oven can handle. Even then the beans don't roast evenly with those at the edge of the tray browning much faster compared to the ones in the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A popcorn machine. The benefits of a popcorn maker are that the beans get agitated and they generally provide enough heat. Downsides of this option are that you have little control, you can only roast small batches and the device may overheat (popcorn takes less time to make than roasting beans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pan on the stove. The benefits are that you can agitate the beans by stirring and you can control the speed of the roast by dialing the heat. The downsides are that you will have to stir throughout the roast so it all darkens evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option would be to use a dedicated home coffee roasting machine, but those tend to be expensive and they're not really everyday tools. Whichever of these methods you use, there will be some or even a lot of smoke production (depending on how dark you roast). So you probably want to think about that as well, maybe by roasting outside or having active ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for how it's done, all methods are pretty much the same. You heat the beans, you provide as much agitation throughout the process so the beans heat evenly. You know when they're done based on visual and audio queues. Per the overview on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_roasting#Roasts" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, different roast levels correspond to the beans' internal temperature. As the beans roast they get darker (see the pictures on Wikipedia) and at some stages you will hear a crack. When home roasting, these cracks may continues for a few minutes as the beans don't always roast evenly, just something to keep in mind. See also  &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/3060"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to judge time between cracks when roasting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on this site.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is high caffeine coffee in Turkey?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I live in Istanbul, I love espresso, but most espresso here is 100% Arabica. Robusta coffee is hard to find.
What alternative coffee do you recommend to get the right caffeine during the day?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A possible different approach.  Getting the perfect flavor is hard enough.  The more constraints and tangential variables you introduce, the harder it is to produce a desired flavor profile.  You say most espresso in Istanbul is made from 100% Arabica, and you love it.  Your objective is just to get more caffeine.  My suggestion would be to not mess with the flavor you love as the mechanism to get more caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robusta has more caffeine, but it also has a different flavor.  There are also some Arabica varieties with more caffeine.  But caffeine is very bitter, and if you substantially increase its content in the brew, the result will be  noticeably more bitter.  So you may sacrifice the flavor you love to get more caffeine from that source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternate approach would be to just take a caffeine tablet when you want the pick-me-up.  You can even wash it down with coffee that still tastes good.  :-)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I make cardamom flavor consistent in Turkish coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've always hated cardamom in Turkish coffee, but the other day I went to a Greek restaurant and forgot to tell them to leave the cardamom out. And it turned out to be really good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to reproduce it, but for some reason I cannot achieve any consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a portable kit for brewing Turkish coffee outside (a small alcohol stove, a small cezve, pre-ground coffee, sugar etc.) and I've been experimenting with cardamom pods from the same batch (a jar of whole cardamom pods from a supermarket shelf, two months old or so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I open the pod, take out the seeds, and add them to the mix at different stages (cold water, right before boiling, right after boiling, in the cup etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It always goes from zero to completely nasty. If I add too little or too late, I don't feel it at all; if I add just a little bit more just a little bit earlier, the cardamom completely masks the flavor of the coffee itself. I can never seem to hit the sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the recipes and YouTube tutorials I've seen so far don't pay any attention to the cardamom, they just open one or two pods and add them to the mix. One pod is always too much for me; half a pod sometimes I don't taste at all, sometimes the cardamom is the only thing that I can taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am about to try different brands of coffee and different brands of cardamom, but before I do that I was wondering if there was some kind of procedure for adding the cardamom that I was missing?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it helps to buy cardamom in an Indian or Pakistani food shop. Most likely, the quality will be good then. Also, crack the pods slightly in a mortar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further remark: Another kind of coffee which tastes very good with cardamom, is the one used in the Gulf countries, see &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1800/beans-for-qatar-type-coffee/1819#1819"&gt;Beans for Qatar-type coffee?&lt;/a&gt; . It tastes very differently from Turkish coffee, but is very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also packaged coffee versions containing cardamon such as this one, &lt;a href="http://www.haseebcoffee.com/cofee-haseeb-en.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.haseebcoffee.com/cofee-haseeb-en.html&lt;/a&gt; , which, in my opinion, have good taste.&lt;/p&gt;

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Will the crowd arrive all at once? If so, this will require commercial grade equipment and I think at least one other person. I know this may not be popular, but batch prepping as much as you can to overcome operational limitations may help. That would mean having iced lattes made in high quantities and stored in the fridge to be poured over ice, also having the grinder's doser full for faster puck prep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult part will be frothed milk based drinks. The foam can not be stored as the bubbles will collapse with a handful of minutes, so these must be made to order. If you have one person pulling shots while the other person focuses on milk it may be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can I make coffee taste better while I recover from COVID?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm experiencing parosmia (unusual or phantom tastes and smells) which is making some (but not all) foods and drinks very unpleasant tasting. Sometimes it feels like I've got somebody's feet under my nose. Or there's vomit in the room with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those drinks affected is coffee, and I'm trying to figure what can reduce the parosmia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've read that some strong smells can be used to counteract the issue, and I've had some success adding extra garlic, chilli and black pepper to my food. Like juice has worked when I drink tea (really not ideal!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of those are going to be pleasant in my coffee. I've learnt salt doesn't work. I haven't got cardamon and I don't know how to prepare it for using in coffee, or if it would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've read that vasoconstriction/vasodilation is involved in parosmia, which might be modified by caffeine strength?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there anything else I can use to strongly flavour my coffee, or modify it (more or less caffeine, darker/lighter roast?) and make it less unpleasant to drink?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Great question! Here are some ideas to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes I add unsweetened cocoa powder (Dutch processed or not) to my coffee. (I add it to the concentrated AeroPress brew before adding the rest of the water just to dissolve it easier. In this situation, adding less water to make a more concentrated brew might also help.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can get Turmeric powder with black pepper in 1000 mg capsules. The intent is to reduce inflammation such as arthritis. The black pepper is supposed to make it more effective and it adds to the taste. Sometimes I open my daily capsule and pour it into coffee. The result is kind of gritty but tasty. You can also get turmeric powder in bulk, and that might be ground finer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please report back on your discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can coffee be reheated to taste like the first cup?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Every morning, I brew my coffee in a French press or a Chemex pour-over glass coffee maker. In general, my first cup tastes good, but the second cup tastes burned after I reheat it in the microwave or on the stove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question: is there a way to heat up coffee and have a cup of coffee that is as close to the first cup as possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my current reheating process: I usually microwave the second cup for two minutes in a new, clean cup, or reheat it on the stove.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;My first read of your title was literal, and I thought, &amp;quot;Sure, you can probably reheat coffee and make it taste like dirty porcelain.&amp;quot;  :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of things can change the taste.  Just sitting out, volatile components that contribute to the aroma evaporate.  Any form of heating speeds that up.  Aroma contributes a lot to the taste.  So this affects the flavor profile, generally in the direction of less-tasty, and with much less of the familiar coffee aroma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you also get some evaporation of the water, which makes the less-tasty coffee a little more concentrated, so that much more noticeable.  Again, there's some evaporation just sitting out, and heating speeds it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you overheat it to near boiling, either the whole cup in a microwave and then let it cool to drinking temperature, or heat it on a stove and the bottom is what gets very hot, you can scorch it and produce off flavors.  I'm not sure if the jury is in on whether heat near boiling also breaks down some of the flavor compounds in the extracted coffee, which would affect the taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to reheat, avoid doing it on the stove.  If you do it in a microwave, don't heat it more than necessary (two minutes is a lot of time for one cup of liquid unless you have a low-power microwave; better to do it in shorter increments and check it to avoid overheating).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best solution is to get a good thermos and keep the hot coffee in that.  You may not need to reheat it.  But if you do, you will likely need to raise the temperature only a small amount.  Whether that tastes like the first cup will depend on how discerning your palate is, but it will be a lot closer to the taste of the first cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach requires a little more time, but it gets you a &amp;quot;first cup&amp;quot; every time.  That is to brew one cup's worth at a time.  With pour-over, that would add a lot of time (OTOH, it might serve as a good excuse to procrastinate something).  If you use a small French press or just put in one serving worth of coffee and water, it would add only rinsing time and heating some water after the first brew in terms of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Aeropress is designed as a single-serving brewer.  You can use it like a French press or brew a serving quickly, and it can be rinsed out quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a time saver, if you consume the second cup within the same eight-hour workday as the first cup, most people wouldn't taste the difference if the coffee for both servings is ground at one time and what's needed for the second serving is kept in a small air-tight container until use.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Why is coarse grind ever better?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a uniform particle size is to get the same level of extraction from all of the coffee.  If there was a big difference in particle size, the small particles would be over-extracted by the time the big particles get well-extracted, or the big particles would get under-extracted by stopping when the small particles are properly extracted.  And the brew ends up a mix of extraction levels rather than a targeted level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference is because it takes time for water to soak into the interior of the particles and leach out the solubles.  The farther the center of the particle is from the surface, the longer it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coarse grind is a different configuration of the same issue.  Water needs to go through the bean material near the surface to get to the bean material at the center.  So you have the same action as large and small particles, only within the same particle.  Bean material near the surface will get over-extracted in the process of extracting from bean material in the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a small particle size, the bean material in the center isn't far from the surface.  So extraction should be very uniform within the particle as well as between particles.  And with a small particle size, extraction time is much faster.  That doesn't preclude any brewing methods, like French press; you would just brew for a shorter time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is so important to start with a uniform grind size, why would a coarse grind ever be desirable?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;One possible answer: it isn't a question of coarse grind being better than medium in a French press, or a uniform grind producing better taste than a non-uniform one. They have different objectives and different effects on the flavor profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coarse grind or non-uniform particle size has a &amp;quot;flatter&amp;quot; distribution curve of extracted flavors. As the extraction progresses, only a fraction of the coffee is contributing over-extracted flavors, and a different fraction of the coffee is contributing more of the light-extraction flavors. So the extraction can add a little bitterness without overwhelming the taste, and the range of extracted flavors stays in more of a balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coarse grind can produce good-tasting coffee with a broader or fuller flavor profile. You can produce good-tasting coffee with a similarly broad/full flavor profile using a non-uniform smaller particle size, but it's harder to control. The particle size can be non-uniform, but the distribution needs to be consistent from grind to grind to zero in on the extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a very uniform particle size, all of the coffee is being extracted to the same degree.  The distribution of flavors has a peak, which moves across the spectrum from light extraction flavors to over-extracted flavors, and all of the coffee follows that peak.  The peak is what you control when you vary the extraction parameters.  If the peak moves into over-extracted territory, all of the coffee is contributing those flavors and it overwhelms the taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A uniform grind size allows targeting a more specific desired flavor profile.  That highlights a desired portion of the flavor distribution rather than producing simply good-tasting coffee with a full flavor.  This can bring out flavors that distinguish specific kinds of beans.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Well according to the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/lSppIjPSxyc?t=54s" rel="nofollow"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; presented on the website you have to provide hot water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my understanding of the machine's principle as well as physics there is absolutely no way it could produce hot coffee from cold water. The confusing quote from the FAQ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Minipresso produces at ambient condition (75°F, 24°C), an espresso at perfect temperature (152°F, 67°C in cup) with a nice compact and persistent crema on top.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Get the best from a Gaggia Unica coffee machine</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Gaggia Unica bean-to-cup machine and I want to use this machine to get the best quality coffee possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How should I use and maintain/clean the machine to ensure the highest standard of coffee possible?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I suggest your first port of call should be the operators manual. Here is an excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Empty and clean the coffee grounds drawer daily, with the machine turned on.
• After having removed the coffee grounds drawer, remove the liquids from the tray placed under the brew group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: We recommend emptying the container if the machine is not going to be used for some days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After brewing milk beverages, dispense hot water from the steam wand (Pannarello, if supplied) to obtain a thorough cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day, after heating the milk, remove the external part of the Pannarello (if supplied) and wash it with fresh drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clean the steam wand weekly. To do this, the following operations have to
be performed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove the external part of the Pannarello (for standard cleaning);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove the upper part of the Pannarello from the steam wand;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wash the upper part of the Pannarello with fresh drinking water;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wash the steam wand with a wet cloth and remove any milk residues;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replace the upper part in the steam wand (make sure it is completely inserted).
Reassemble the external part of the Pannarello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to clean the water tank daily. For an easier removal of the
water tank, move the steam wand / Pannarello upwards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove the small white filter in the water tank and wash it under running drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reposition the small white filter in its housing by gently pressing and turning it at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fill the tank with fresh drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empty and clean the drip tray daily. Perform this operation also when the float is raised.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Would 2 small V60 brews (1 cup each) be less bitter than 1x large (2 cup) brew?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I regularly brew my V60 for myself and my girlfriend on the weekends. However today I was wondering if I were to brew 2 separate batches instead one 1 big batch, would I get a less bitter cup? I'm assuming yes, because of the contact time between the water and coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the 60g coffee to 1000ml of water ratio. So when I make 2 cups, usually go with 40g of coffee to 666ml of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was wondering would I get a less bitter cup by doing 2 separate brews?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You'll definitely get a less bitter and possibly sour (underextracted) brew when dividing up one 40g dose between two V60s &lt;em&gt;if you don't adjust the grind&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you point out, the lower contact time of the 20g of grinds will lead to less extraction, and thus less bitterness, and possibly under extraction. This is just a characteristic of pour-over brews (as opposed to immersion brews) - grind size (and uniformity) is directly related to contact time and thus extraction, so the two variables can't be independently manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are the common Ethiopia Sidamo roast suggestions?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I usually roast Brazil and Colombia beans, and I must say I have already found the profile I've been wanting in those beans, like the chocolaty nutty, the right balance of acidity and all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happens that a friend gave me a couple of kilos of Ethiopia beans and I was a bit hesitant to roast it for I'm not sure what exactly is the preferred roasting style, and I might just waste a great coffee origin, yet I am excited to roast it, any suggestion?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Actually it depends where you want to use your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using you coffee in an espresso machine, you may want to prefer a darker roast, maybe Vienna Roast. Just a bit darker than medium. This will keep acidity at lower values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using French press, your cup will not be as acidic as in espresso. So, to taste the fruity flavors, it is better to roast lighter, somewhere around Light Roast to City Roast may be preferable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final words: it is up to your taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guideline for roast naming is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_roasting" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there a way to drip-brew coffee with lower acidity?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;How do I brew a good cup of coffee with lower acidity? I want to continue drinking coffee, but the acidity is getting to me. Is their any way to brew coffee so that it isn't so acidic?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are at least three ways to reduce acidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way is to roast the beans more, to a dark level. I think that is the main way if you want to stick with your beans. This is inline with &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2570/how-best-to-reduce-tannins-in-black-coffee/2571#2571"&gt;MT San's comment and related answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second way is to play with the speed of dripping. The idea is to find a speed of water flowing through the coffee ground that gives better results (depending on your goal---here lower acidity). A slower water flow will keep the ground longer, so extract or destruct more compounds---thus a different flavour. In my limited experiments here, faster flow brings more acidity. But I am not confident on the generality of this result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative, when you are fine with changing beans, is to get a variety or a blend that results in lower acidity. This is not as efficient as a dark roast, but you can get more flavours and variations. Roasting artisans should be able to offer good candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be other ways, but I have no other experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Later...&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to @Chris_in_AK, I have recalled another alternative: Cold-brew. The question refers to "drip-brew", so cold-brew is border-line, but it is technically a drip, with cold water, so here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold brew allows to extract very different flavour profiles. The slow, soft process takes ages (8 to 12 hours), for often surprising results. And warming up the result leads to yet again different flavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, drinks are less acid with coffee brew. I do not use a wide range of beans, so please keep in mind that this claim may depend on the species. Also, the roast level leads to different results---exactly as a hot-water drip does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold brew emphasizes "green" or "herbal" notes, though. It is, I believe, worth a try as acidity is different, but it is yet different from "usual coffee drinks". Well, production is hard too.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Reliable and safe stove top milk steamers</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm not yet ready to "invest" in an espresso machine with in built steam wand and am looking for a gateway to convince me it is worthwhile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there &lt;em&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt;, dedicated, decent stove top milk frothers capable of generating microfoam?  I'm currently reasonably happy with what I can get out of my Aeropress but want to "do milk right".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I have seen the "Bellman" on line, but it looks pretty awkward to use and I am not convinced this exactly brimming with safety features. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I recently got a Bellman and consider it very hefty and well made. I am not a professional barista, but I have been chasing beautiful (and not overheated) microfoam in cafes since at least 2007. I was able to achieve microfoam on my first try (though not my second), and am super happy with it as a purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For safety, I would give it mixed results. It's not going to explode like an old school pressure cooker unless you leave it to boil dry, which would definitely take a while, even if you only put in an inch of water, and it does have an escape valve on the handle to reduce that kind of craziness. It does get hot, so you do have to watch where you put your hands, though if you keep the burner low/narrow flame as you heat it, the handles stay cool to the touch. I didn't feel comfortable with it for the first few times I used it, and did hit my knuckle against a hot bit the first time I used it, but I figured out that because I'm left handed, if I orient it with the steam wand pointing left, it's fine. Probably more flexible for me than a standard machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that you can fill it only about an inch, and have it heat much more quickly. And with that smaller amount of water you can do a handful of drinks, in my experience. You might have to put it back on the burner for a very short time between drinks to bump it back up to steam, but you only use a small amount of the water each time to steam. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nespresso milk heater/foamer my friend has is a plug-in appliance, and it was a less satisfying result. Less control over the milk temperature, a consistent, but eh foam quality. It was trivial to use, but I didn't care for the results. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Are there any well known coffee experts who have given any kopi luwak a positive review?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have read quite a few reviews of kopi luwak, the legendary "civet poo coffee" from Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I've found all the reputable coffee experts say it's pretty much a scam and the coffee tastes horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also travellers who give it OK reviews but you can tell they're not experts and could just as well be giving it an OK review because they've been told it's the best / most expensive coffee in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hype or not there are surely varying quality kopi luwaks from sources of varying local reputation, and there are surely many fake kopi luwaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But have there been any reviews by trusted coffee experts who made sure they were getting a "good" luwak or who compared many and gave at least one of them a good review?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I like my coffee, have tried a lot of different varieties and roast my own, but I won't claim to be a coffee expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had the opportunity to taste several (about 6) variations of kopi luwak from various sources in Indonesia and Bali. The quality differences in these are as big as with any other type of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The factors that affect kopi luwak quality are the same as those that affect any other coffee. Namely, the quality of the coffee bean being grown, the processing of the beans, the roast and the storage conditions. Preparation is also important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The samples of kopi luwak I tried ranged from OK to horrid, but none of them would have been in the "excellent" category. All kopi luwak would perform very badly on the $/kg test - there's just no way that those coffees are so good that they can justify the cost based purely on flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to answer your question, this probably lines up with your research. Kopi luwak is special because of the story behind it, not because it is a fantastic beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On grinding level 24 I get with 15g powder after 25 seconds 73g espresso in two cups which is way too much (it should be 35-40g).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On grinding level 23 the machine is able to get any espresso if I tamper normal. If I barley tamper, I get 27g Espresso after 25 seconds, but it tastes horrible sour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do temperature surfing and wait 0 to 20 seconds after the heating phase before I start the machine. I tried different beans which are 1 to 3 month old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any idea what might be the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;That's a pretty extreme contrast for a one-level difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple things you could try:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use slightly less grounds if you're on level 23 - this will make your puck a bit easier to push water through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weiss Distribution Technique - use a toothpick to break up any clumps you have in the grounds before tamping - try this on level 24, since you may have some channeling going on with the slightly coarser grounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-infuse your puck with grounds from level 23 - soaking them a bit early before starting the pull may help you to get a proper extraction. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DYefiSAPXc" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;See this youtube video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Instead of cleaning the whole machine I dumped in some Oxiclean in the carafe, filed it with water and waited.  A brown foam formed and I was left with a good as new carafe.  My question is can I run oxiclean through the machine without damaging it. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't use Oxyclean inside. 
That "brown foam" that you had in the carafe would be difficult to remove from the inside working without a LOT of rinse cycles.
I simply use a solution of 1/3 vinegar and 2/3 water and run that through with great results. 
I also use filtered water which helps tremendously keeping things clean.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Vessels for frothing and pouring the milk</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently bought an espresso machine with steamer for the milk. However I noticed that the quality of the foam changes according to the vessel I use to steam and froth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there a specific type of vessel I should use for steaming, frothing and pouring the milk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have had a similar experience, and the difference seems to be due to the age of the milk. The fresher the milk, the better micro-foam I can create. Once it gets within of week of expiration, I start getting less foam. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pitcher also makes a difference. Other people recommended the Espro toroid pitcher to me. I liked it so much, I bought two sizes: &lt;a href="http://espro.ca/toroid/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://espro.ca/toroid/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Custom hot drinks maker availability</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am interested in finding out if the following product exists, a custom hot drinks maker e.g. User adds own ingredients, such as blended coffee beans, instant coffee granules, milk, teabags, sugar, and so on, then selects quantities of each ingredient to create custom hot drink (saved onto onboard memory).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This custom drink could then be accessed any time by the user E.g on selection menu Users &gt; Connor &gt; Morning Coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like a simple enough device that a product like this would be available to purchase, however I cant find any online. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking for something like this as I like the idea of a hot drinks maker, however I want to continue drinking my favourite drinks, and not be limited to pre made sachets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone could fill me in on any information regarding the existence of such a product I would be extremely grateful, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, there are commercial automats (machines) that can prepare custom defined hot beverages from granules or beans. (I have never seen one that can properly brew tea, though.) They can add milk powder or milk. Furthermore, those automats can even put a stick to stir the sugar at the end. There exist also small sizes that can fit onto a kitchen desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I'm not sure if this is the gadget that you desire.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is a FlavorLock™ bag?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What is a FlavorLock™ bag? Why it is important for wrapping coffee product or even pet food? Does it have any effect to the product inside if we use an ordinary bag? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fJ0By.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fJ0By.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This question is actually answered on the &lt;a href="https://customerservice.starbucks.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1949" rel="nofollow"&gt;website of the coffee producer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, the roasting process of coffee produces carbon dioxide inside the beans, which takes a while to find its way out. Sealing the coffee in tight containers would be problematic, as the carbon dioxide would stay in the beans in this way (making the coffee sour) or may let the bag burst over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not sealing coffee bags is not a solution either, as exposure to air lets the coffee get stale after a while. As supermarket coffee is unfortunately often stored for long period of time before sold, this would be problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the solution is to either (1) use a one-way valve that allows the carbon dioxide to escape from the bag without the air coming into the bag, or (2) to let the beans degas before sealing them airtight in bags. Solution (1) is probably best for fresh coffee, so it is used here. I don't know what problem is solved with such valves in pet food containers.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are the different varieties of coffee- understanding the nearest coffee shop menu?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am unaware of the different varieties of coffee. I have heard names like latte, expresso, etc. but do not know the differences between those and what are some other varieties. Since this is a stackexchange on the very topic, some details would be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are many, many, many types. In order to give a good overview, some background knowledge is useful. What all types of coffee have in common is that all are produced from the pits of coffee cherries, the fruits borne by trees in the genus coffea (coffee beans are technically seeds of these trees, not beans). Coffee cherries are harvested from coffee trees, the pits are removed and processed, producing green coffee beans. These are then roasted, ground, and brewed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee can vary on any of the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bean Variety -&lt;/strong&gt; There are two major bean varieties of coffee: arabica and robusta. Arabica coffees are more ubiquitous and generally regarded as superior in quality to robusta coffees. If you are buying coffee from a coffee shop, ordering it at a restaurant, or brewing it at home, there is a very good chance you are drinking an arabica variety. Robusta is easier to grow and a less temperamental crop than arabica, contains quite a bit more caffeine, and generally is poorer quality than arabica. Robusta varieties are often used in instant coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing Method -&lt;/strong&gt; There are two major processing types for green coffee beans: washed and unwashed. Washed coffees remove the cherry before the bean is left to dry, while unwashed coffees have their beans removed from the cherries after drying. Unwashed coffees often come from Africa and Indonesia and have richer, earthier flavors, while washed coffees often come from Latin America, and are smoother and fruitier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geographic Origin -&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most important factors, as coffee flavors vary greatly with geography, climate, and soil composition. For example, Ethopian coffees tend to be rich, full-bodied, and wine-like, Hawaiian coffees like Kona tend to be more acidic (flavor term, not pH), and Latin American coffees tend to be more medium bodied, fruity, and floral.
Roast - Roasting is a complex process that can produce varying degrees of flavor and caffeine content. Roasts levels can include light/half-city, medium/full-city, full (Viennese/Italian), and double (French), in order of increasing boldness. Contrary to popular opinion, lighter roasts tend to have more caffeine than darker roasts. A good illustration of the process can be found here: &lt;a href="http://www.sweetmarias.com/roast" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.sweetmarias.com/roast&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brewing method -&lt;/strong&gt; Can include drip filter, french press, percolated, espresso, or other methods. Brewing method also makes a big difference, with coffee aficionados generally preferring french press and espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most expensive type of coffee is Kopi Luwak from Sumatra, Bali, Java, and Sulawesi. Kopi Luwak roughly translates to "civet coffee" in English, and is called such because the beans are harvested from the droppings of civets (a cat-like mammal from Indonesia). The beans are supposedly of superior quality because the civets choose only the ripest coffee beans to eat from coffee trees, and are processed in a unique way by the civets digestive tract. Kopi Luwak often sells for around $300/lb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are the different types of coffee drinks that you may find in a cafe that prepares coffee using the espresso coffee making method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affogato-&lt;/strong&gt; This is a term that literally means 'drowned'. It is the description of a shot of separately served espresso that is later poured over a the top of a scoop of vanilla ice cream or gelato. This beverage is usually served in a short drink glass and is a Italian desert favourite. Popular Affogatos include Vanilla Affogato, Mocha Affogato, and Peppermint Affogato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Americano-&lt;/strong&gt; Also known as "Lungo" or "Long Black" and made by diluting 1-2 shots of espresso with hot water in order to approximate the texture, flavor and body of an American-style drip coffee. Said to have been originally devised as a sort of insult to Americans who wanted their Italian espresso diluted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Babycino-&lt;/strong&gt; A cappuccino styled drink served in an up-market café typically for children. It consists of warm milk in a small cup and topped with milk froth and chocolate powder. No espresso coffee essence is added.
Breve: A term in Italian that means short and is used to describe an espresso coffee drink made with a half-and-half light cream or semi-skim milk instead of full fat milk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffe' Freddo-&lt;/strong&gt; Chilled, sweetened espresso served in a tall glass, often on ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffe Latte or “Latte”-&lt;/strong&gt; A ‘premium milk coffee experience’. Freshly steamed milk without foam served in a tall glass with a shot of espresso coffee.
Caffe Mocha: A combination of chocolate syrup and a shot of espresso, topped with steamed milk and a layer of micro-foam. Finished with a sprinkled of chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cappuccino Chiaro-&lt;/strong&gt; (AKA Wet or Light cappuccino): Cappuccino prepared with more milk than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cappuccino Scuro-&lt;/strong&gt; (AKA Dry or Dark cappuccino) Cappuccino prepared with less milk than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cappuccino: “Cap”-&lt;/strong&gt;  A ‘traditional morning heart starter’. Steamed foamed velvety milk poured over one shot (1) of coffee oil extract made from 12gm of freshly ground beans producing 38ml of essence. Finished by topping with foam and a sprinkle of chocolate powder. Served in a pre heated vitrified ceramic cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Con panna-&lt;/strong&gt; Like the beverage "macchiato", but whipped cream is substituted for steamed milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortado-&lt;/strong&gt; means "cut" in Spanish so the double shot espresso served in a demetesse glass supported with a metal handle is "cut" with an equal part of hot milk, making it in between the size and strength of a macchiato and a cappuccino. It is popular in Spain and Portugal, as well as throughout Latin America and Cuba, where it is drunk in the afternoon. Variations include more froth on top than a traditional cortado and occasionally with different names such as Piccolo or Gibraltar. Thanks to Ryan Cerbus for the entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corretto-&lt;/strong&gt; Espresso "corrected" with a touch of grappa, cognac, sambuca, or other spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doppio-&lt;/strong&gt; Italian term for double. Double Espresso or twice the amount of coffee and twice the amount of water. Basically it describes two shots of espresso in one demitasse container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Espresso con Panna-&lt;/strong&gt; A variation of the macchiato by substituting a dollop of whipped cream for the milk froth. Basically a Starbucks invention. Means in Italian "espresso with cream”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Espresso Lungo-&lt;/strong&gt; American term where a shot is extracted longer for a bit of extra espresso. Tends to maximizes the caffeine but will mostly produce a more bitter cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Espresso Romano-&lt;/strong&gt; Espresso served with a lemon peel on the side. Whilst not a typical accompaniment in Italy it is commonly served with the espresso beverage in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat White-&lt;/strong&gt; “White Coffee” - ‘uncompromising taste’.Steamed microfroam milk poured through and under the espresso crème produced from one shot (1) of coffee extract made on 12gm of freshly ground coffee producing 38ml of essence. Served in a pre heated vitrified ceramic cup. A common espresso coffee order in Australia/New Zealand. Great for latte art!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hammerhead-&lt;/strong&gt; A coffee drink only served in the USA. It is an American term for a shot of espresso in a coffee cup that is topped up with drip-filtered coffee. As Kris Rosvold explains in the comments: In Oregon, the hammerhead is usually known as a red eye and uses 2 shots of espresso topped up in a 16oz travel mug with drip coffee. It's also sometimes called a "shot in the dark".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irish Coffee-&lt;/strong&gt; Coffee mixed with a dash of Irish whiskey and served with cream on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latte Macchiato-&lt;/strong&gt; Steamed milk served in a tall glass rather than a cup that is “stained” by a shot of espresso coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Black-&lt;/strong&gt; Often called the “American”. It is the ‘benchmark coffee without milk’. It is pure coffee made from one &amp;amp; one half shots of coffee extract made on 16gm of fresh ground beans producing 50ml of essence blended with steamed water. Served in a pre heated vitrified ceramic cup with the essence floated over the top of a cup filled with hot/boiling water. It is a standard espresso (Short Black) but lengthened by the addition of hot/boiling water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lungo-&lt;/strong&gt; An espresso made by purposely allowing more water to flow through the ground coffee than usual. (sometimes called an Americano or ‘long’).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macchiato-&lt;/strong&gt; Meaning “stained” - Described as ‘strong, marked or stained’. A touch of steamed foamed milk added to a double shot of coffee extract made from 24gm of fresh ground beans producing 75ml of essence. Served in glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mazagran-&lt;/strong&gt; A French drink composed of cold coffee and seltzer water. First created by the French soldiers in 1840 in the town of Argelia. A variation includes iced coffee made with maraschino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quad-&lt;/strong&gt; An espresso drink made with four shots of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ristretto-&lt;/strong&gt; (Ristretto in Italian means "restricted, shrunk or short”) It is the richest and most concentrated espresso drink where less water but the same amount of coffee is used to make the beverage and creates a less bitter espresso. The extraction time is shortened producing as little as 3 oz of liquid per serving. Pure and intense espresso served in a demitasse cup.
Short Black: A ‘pure intense Italian favourite with a biting crème head. Contains 75ml of pure double shot (2) coffee essence made from 24gm of fresh ground coffee beans. Traditionally served in glass and is referred to as Espresso by European customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viennese Coffee-&lt;/strong&gt; Brewed black coffee of any roast or origin topped and served with whipped cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reached this part then remember. The list doesn't stops here my fried...!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If consumed at the incorrect time, yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sure, it can certainly yellow teeth over time, but I think this also comes down to genetics and personal hygiene - strength of tooth enamel, frequency of and care when brushing teeth, etc.&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Where to measure ET on drum roaster</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am considering upgrading my home roasting setup to a gas &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00SM3HXXY" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kaldi Wide&lt;/a&gt;. Part of what is so appealing is that this roaster is so bare bones and will be easy to modify to try different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to drop a thermocouple into the bean mass to get my bean temp. Beyond that I want to measure the environment temperature as well. Where should I measure that? Somewhere above the drum? As is, this roaster has no forced convection. I am considering adding a duct hose and impeller over the bean hopper with a damper depending on how things go after my first few roasts with no air flow. If I did that would it be more valuable to look at this exhaust temperature? I am under the assumption that the advantage to trying to get an environmental temperature is that it would be more responsive than the actual bean temperature to show you where the roast is going - if I am thinking about it wrong please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm not very familiar with the Kaldi roaster. From what little I've read, most buyers are pretty happy with it. I built a home roaster about a year ago using equipment from RK Drums, which requires a dedicated gas grill. I'm really happy with the results I get from this setup. I noticed the Kaldi also requires the purchase of a gas burner but what size and form is it? I use a single thermocouple that mounts very close (~1/2") to the drum. I'm not sure how you plan to drop one right in the bean mass while the drum is rotating. Again I'm not very familiar with the Kaldi so maybe you've worked this out. Using forced air might help if you think the beans aren't getting even temp distribution. I don't use forced air. The thermal mass of the grill cavity along with the bean rotation seems to distribute the temperate quite evenly. Wherever you place the probe, as long as you can get a consistent and reliable reading you should be able to build your roast profiles accordingly. Good luck and I look forward to your updates with the results!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Shelf life of beans?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My friend is able to get thousands of pounds of beans shipped to him from the Honduras from a family farm.  He's had nearly 100 pounds of these beans for over 4 months, he's insisted on selling them.  My contention has been that these beans are not fresh and will reduce the quality of coffee that is being sold from them.  Is there a typical shelf life for beans to guarantee freshness after roasting?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think it is generally regarded that beans are still 'fresh' within one month of roasting where the flavour profile of the bean will change over that one month. Dissecting it further, people tend to agree that beans should be at their peak within 2 weeks of roasting. Past a month the bean should show noticeable signs of decline in the flavour profile, losing most of the brighter notes and acidity and providing a much flatter flavour profile as most complex compounds in the coffee would have disintegrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You mention that your friend has had those beans for over 4 months, even if measured since the roast date, you can safely say that those beans are stale. At this point there's really no difference between getting rid of them now or later as they should not degrade much further if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why can't I have enough crema with my espresso machine? Doesn't it provide enough pressure?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;It seems my machine doesn't create enough pressure because I &lt;strong&gt;can't create a decent crema&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The machine heats up water which increases the pressure and eventually the water makes it through the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried compressing the coffee so it's more dense and more difficult to penetrate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lead to a longer time till the first drops of coffee started pouring but still no crema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My coffee machine is a Krups 872-42 Bravo Plus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4CXHz.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4CXHz.jpg" alt="Krups F 872 42 Bravo Plus"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;First things first, the ingredients of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;crema&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is partly the answer of this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foam on top of any coffee beverage (espresso, Turkish, aeropress or any other) is formed simply the same. A lipid/water emulsion forms the outer sphere and some gas is inside this sphere. All these spheres stick to each other with tiny coffee bean fragments invisible to human eye. Let's focus to the gas. The gas is mostly Carbon dioxide that is produced during the Maillard reaction when the coffee beans are roasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now we know the chemistry behind. There are three (actually four, but water is there all the time) main contents for our recipe to produce crema:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lipids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee bean fragments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carbon dioxide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lipids and Carbon dioxide are formed by roasting. Fragments are the very very fine powders emerge as the side product of grinding. Fragments don't leave the ground coffee. Lipids, too. But, Carbon dioxide flies away in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, after roasting the beans, it is better to wait for two to four days (based on many criteria just like bean type, roast level, brewing technique, etc.) for the Carbon dioxide level of the roasted beans to settle. Then, the flavor of those beans will be delicious. After that time, Carbon dioxide fades away and the roasted beans start to stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can reason, if your beans have less Carbon dioxide, your final cup of coffee would have less crema. If you have freshly roasted (e.g. 3-days old) coffee, your final cup of espresso would have a thick foam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also known that water pressure affects the crema volume, but should not affect as much as you mentioned here. Even at 7 bars, a decent crema forms according to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12452670" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a note, if your machine has difficulties producing enough pressure, more tamping will probably results over-heated water flowing very slowly through the grounds, causing them to burn and all of the lipids to evaporate, could not form the spheres of the crema. As a result, you probably worsen the crema production, coffee odor fills the room but you cannot drink that flavor. Now, all you'll get is boiled coffee juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; The amount of crema is mostly correlated with the freshness of the coffee, not the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's the simplest/cheapest coffee maker that can make a good latte automatically?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I would like to buy a machine that can make me a cup of good latte/cappuccino in the morning. There are dozens of options on the market: from capsule-based machines to huge expensive pro coffee makers, so it's very hard to choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the simplest/cheapest machine (in terms of long-term costs) that can make a good latte automatically? By 'automatically' I mean a system that delivers a cup of coffee with a press of a button, rather than having to skim milk separately.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I suggest you that do some research on superautomatic machines, there are plenty of options and we can discuss for years on which one is better (or worse).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to consider your budget I'll say. There are many machines, many brands, many functionalities, etc... But you'll never produce a &lt;em&gt;great latte&lt;/em&gt;, because no machine (someone correct me please) can steam milk automatically with the consistency of a human barista. Most of automatic machines only froth the milk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe if you could present us more options or specify your constraints, we can be more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's Kratom, the coffee-like herb?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So what is this kratom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw it on Facebook, something about trump banning it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked it up and it is a coffee like herb, possibly with psychedelic effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow... Can someone give me some insight on it?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What happens to ground coffee if poured over with very warm instead of hot water?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I drink my coffee by putting ground coffee into a cup and pour it over with water that comes out of a heated Nespresso machine (I don't like to use capsules). However, I noticed that the water that comes out of this heated machine is not hot but rather very warm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the effects of warm water (in comparison to very hot water) poured over ground coffee beans with regards to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;taste &amp;amp; flavours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;health effects on the human body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Well first we should probably establish how cold the water is once it hits the ground. I imagine it is heated to almost boiling temperature in the Nespresso machine, however when it comes out and hits the cold cup it cools down almost immediately to probably 85 to 90°C or something around that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general colder water means basically that you are extracting less solid compounds of the coffee at a slower rate. So it is impossible really to draw any specific conclusions without knowing how hot the water is and how long the extraction takes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there are some general rules that always apply as the aforementioned slower extraction at lower temperatures. Another one is that with increasing contact time the extraction will be higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of flavor lower extractions are generally associated with more acidic/sour coffee and the higher the extraction the more of the bitter compounds will be in your cup. An ideal extraction will be balanced with some fruity acidity and some darker, chocolaty flavors. Since you are using a full immersion technique it will not make that much of a difference though. I imagine you wait a few minutes before you start drinking the coffee? So there's probably a short moment where the extraction is balanced but the longer you sip on your cup the more bitter it gets which means overextraction. I think time is the more relevant variable in your case (if my estimate of the temperature is more or less correct)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health wise I don't think it will make much of a difference either for the above mentioned reasons. Most of the caffein is extracted early on and by the end the extraction will be relatively high, regardless of the somewhat lower initial temperature. And since you are doing full immersion you will additionally always ingest a good amount of coffee grounds anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I get a clean taste while drip brewing?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been brewing drip Coffee on different devices. Kalita and Chemex mostly. Although the results  have often been great. The biggest turn-off for me is getting an earthy, not-clean and bright tasting cup. I only use fresh specialty coffees so the problem cannot lie there. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The Kalita and Chemex equipment are designed for pour-over brewing. If you are using them as vessel-recipients of water from an automated dripper, it will not produce the kind of cup you desire due to the randomness at which it applies water over the bed of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; doing pour-over, there are a few major parameters that you will have to control to produce clean cups. Note that you will require a gooseneck kettle in order to have proper control over the water flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grind. Ensure that you are using a burr grinder that is of decent quality, meaning that it can grind to a good consistency with a low number of fines. Fines are smaller granules of coffee produced in the grinding process as the beans are crushed and can over-extract to bring out bitter flavours. Your grind size should also be of &lt;a href="https://kuissential.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/04-Intro2B.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;medium&lt;/a&gt; level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water Temperature. This is one of the most important factors of the bunch for pour-over brewing in my experience. It's the parameter that you will change to fine tune how many compounds are being dissolved as you brew once you have a grind size that is in the right ball park. You should experiment with this as it will depend on the grind size and dose you use but I like to keep it at around 90 degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agitation. This measures how much you move and disturb the coffee. The more you agitate it by pouring, the more you continuously expose the coffee grounds to the water and encourage extraction. Controlling this will be another experimental variable for your specific parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the above three that I believe to be the most important factors in what makes a clean pour-over brew, you should also take into account, the brew time, coffee-to-water ratio, coffee dose and obviously coffee origin and freshness.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Do you need to use ice water in a Bruer slow drip coffee maker?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In the instructions for the Bruer, it says to use ice water (&lt;a href="http://www.bruer.co/pages/instuctions" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.bruer.co/pages/instuctions&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cso1b.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cso1b.png" alt="Screenshot of water adding step"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering how important is that for the brewing process? I'd like to leave it in the office overnight to brew, but don't have access to ice here. We do have one of those taps that chills water, would that be good enough?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have no specific experience with this cold brew device but a general understanding of how extraction works and experience with other devices. In short, you can definitely use water at room temperature to make cold brew (I think it is better), but there seem to be some specific issues with this cold brew maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general the colder the water, the slower it will extract the solid compounds from the coffee. This is the main thing you have to keep in mind, because you will have to adjust some other variables in order to reach the right extraction. In their instructions they suggest you use a medium grind level. This is one variable you could change. Instead of a medium grind level I would use a medium to coarse grind. Another variable that you could change is the brew time. They set the device to 1 drop per second but you could increase that a little to speed up the brewing process, resulting in less extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically with this device there seems to be the problem, that air bubbles block the valve (see the FAQ on the website). They argue that the changing water temperature is responsible for the bubbles to appear. However if you brew at room temperature the water temperature should be much more consistent than with ice water which will obviously melt eventually and then the water will warm up. So I'm not quite sure about their logic (unless you are supposed to add ice until the brewing is over).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest you go ahead and try it at room temperature, adjusting the other variables. Make sure you pre infuse properly so the grounds degas as much as possible, that should prevent too much gas blocking the valve. Alternatively you could use refrigerated water and brew it in the fridge.
Hope this helps, in the end it's a lot of trial and error anyways. Have fun brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it Okay to Reuse One-time Coffee Filter Cups for Coffee Pods?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a bag of 10 Rombouts filter coffee cups and I wonder if these can be reused:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6gyO3.jpg" width="450" height="393"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to reuse them but have concern from health perspective as well as practicality of this. Since coffee in a used filter cup has been used, I would remove it and place coffee pod in its place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you can remove the coffee grounds/filter and replace just those, then yes it will be safe from a health perspective.  The plastic in the filter "cone" should be food safe, though durability may be an eventual concern.  The plastic cup base can definitely be reused, as is intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the practicality concerns go, it may be more of a pain than it's worth.  The coffee containing part of the filter funnel is going to be pretty well attached, in order to keep it from slipping into the cup below and steeping (like tea) vs. simply having the water run through it.  You could probably remove the coffee filter and perch a coffee pod in it's place, but it would not be sealed to the plastic cone, and hot water may run around it without actually percolating through the coffee grounds in the pod.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How should I distribute coffee from a small roaster?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am about to start a coffee roasting business somewhere in the States. For now the game plan is to sell online. What are the most feasible strategies to ship small batches (14 oz)? Is that a good idea to sell online to begin with?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you're shipping 14 oz or less, USPS First Class Mail is an option which will save you quite a bit of money over USPS Flat Rate, and will definitely be less than UPS or FedEx small packages. If you do your shipping through ShipStation or negotiate your USPS rates, you can optionally get your First Class Mail bumped up to anything under 1 lb. which could help you out further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I would think that it'd be your goal as a business owner and roaster to ship more than 14oz at a time - i.e. get your customers to order multiple packs of 12 or 14oz. That would bump you up into the 2-3 lb range which can no longer be sent via First Class Mail, but it could go out via Priority or Priority Flat Rate. More costly, but usually 1-3 day delivery time on Priority Mail which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Caffeine vs Nicotine addiction</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;We, who love coffee very much, have a belief that coffee(which has caffeine) is better than cigarette or any other products which has nicotine. But as far as I know caffeine isn't so good for the body too. Is caffeine is less harmful than nicotine? Is there any comparative analysis on this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Here's a study where cocaine addicts were given IV nicotine or caffeine in comparable amounts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11160635" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11160635&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, both drugs showed roughly equal good/bad effects, patient liking, and stimulation, but nicotine caused most of the patients' heart rates to increase, while caffeine caused them to decrease. This particular article doesn't have much bearing on non-cocaine addicts, but it's the most reputable I could find that directly compared the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most scientists agree that 1-3 cups of coffee a day isn't that bad for most people, especially if you take it black (no sugar, non-dairy substitutes, and other bad stuff).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why of the-shelf-coffee packages are aluminum from the inside</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Why of-the-shelf coffee packages (available e.g. in supermarkets) are covered with aluminum (or some sort of hard silver a little bit shiny thick foil) from the inside?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I used to think this was just a marketing exercise (when it was applied to crisps/potato chips in American-Speak) but it's to do with it's excellent properties for keeping things fresh and sealing properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at the Key features from this &lt;a href="http://www.hydro.com/en/products/Rolled-products/Foil-and-strip-for-packaging/Aseptic-packaging/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aluminium foil in packaging helps keep foodstuffs fresh for months without refrigeration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the outstanding barrier properties and contributions to the sealing process, aluminium foil guarantees the excellent material and filling performance of aseptic and retortable packaging for milk, juices and soups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It prevents the contents from losing nutritional value, vitamins or aroma and gives total protection against light, moisture, oxygen, foreign matter contamination and damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why it's predominantly used in food packaging and not just for coffee packages, the foil is essentially a barrier to the outside environment to stop the beans from being exposed to oxygen and light, although some carbon dioxide gas will build up, there is a relief/degassing valve to allow this to escape&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee Sites with Flavor Profile</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm on the hunt for new kinds of coffee, and I want to know how they taste before I buy them. I've found one way of doing this &lt;a href="https://barringtoncoffee.com/product-category/profile/espresso/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;on this site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hover your mouse over the coffees, a flavor profile wheel appears that gives you an idea of the coffee flavor. I understand visual pictures like this much better than a written description of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem is, I've already tasted many of their coffees. I'm drinking one of them as I type this. But I want to branch out and explore other options.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have suggestions for how to find out this level of visual detail about how a coffee tastes? I'm sick of paying for a pound of coffee plus shipping, only to find out that the coffee tastes like rocks. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;That is a simplified 'consumer' version of a coffee flavor wheel that roasters / importers etc use for trying to put words to a coffees flavor.  It is a really good way to try and explain the flavor of the coffee, but honestly, most roasteries won't have the development background or funds to make the fancy background on their products.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run my own roastery, and happen to be a software developer as well and to get that to work on my site would take quite a bit of customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation would be to familiarize yourself with a standard SCAA flavor wheel and pay attention to the cupping notes on each coffee.  Here's the caveat.  If the roaster is terrible, his cupping notes (or flavor wheel graphics) will still probably say the same things as a roaster that is producing high quality coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you become accustomed to single origin coffees you will be able to immediately go straight to your preferred origins from each roaster faster.  For instance, I have a customers who will only drink Guatemalan coffee because it matches their particular preferences, the same for Ethiopian etc.  If you find that Ethiopian fits your preferred flavors, then you can explore more confidently knowing that most Ethiopian coffees will have a 'similar' flavor profile.  Not all coffees from a particular country will have the same flavor profile, but it's a good place to start if you are looking for something to fit a particular flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much time should I wait between drinking coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I drink the first coffee in the morning, initially I get energized from it. However if I go for a second one right after, or even wait a while, I don't get the same rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long should I wait between each coffee drink so I can get the same buzz? 
 Is there an equation for this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I don't know that this is a standard time period.. Honestly, the more coffee you drink, the less you are going to get the 'buzz' going. A lot of this depends on your body type, activity level, and genes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to think of caffeine like a drug, because that is what it essentially is.  When you take your first sip of coffee, it takes about 45 minutes for 99% of the caffeine to be absorbed by your system.  The caffeine has a half life of roughly 4-6 hours in the human body.  That buzz you are feeling is because as you have slept, all of the caffeine in your system has been depleted and thus when you get that first cup in the morning, your system gets a big blast of caffeine after not having any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a pretty interesting article that contains a lot of the information I just parroted above (plus quite a bit more):&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee too less for Frenchpress</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am new to frenchpress coffee and love the rich flavour of coffee it makes. However I am not sure if I am doing it right. The coffee beans I had grinder packet says 7g of coffee in 180ml of water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When done properly, it makes less than a quarter of a standard mug. 
Is it ok for me too add more grams of coffee with additional water to equal amounts? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would I know if this is too much strong and can be dangerous because the more grams I put in the more stronger it get. Plus 7g and 180 ml of water won’t let me push down the bat of frenchpress as it’s so low water so it is already on bottom. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The instructions have poor wording, instead use 7g PER 180ml of water, and make as many cups as you like / your french press can hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I use an 8 cup french press, I use roughly 50g of coffee, and fill with water high enough to be full when in full bloom (about 30 seconds after you add water and the coffee is expanding, and letting off c02) After about 45 seconds, I give it a quick stir, and top the french press up with about another ounce or so of water and cover for 4 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ratio of coffee per water is a suggestion ONLY.  Typically I recommend 8-9g per 120g of water (If I recall, SCAA standard is 9g per 120g water?)  Use it as a starting place, and adjust based on your taste, and how much coffee you want to brew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a note, I go lighter than my suggested ratios in a french press because it brews stronger.  The 8-9g works well with a drip brewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh.. one other thing!  You are going to have a hard time making &lt;em&gt;dangerous&lt;/em&gt; coffee, unless you consider tasting bad dangerous, so don't worry about it being a risk if you are adding too much coffee.  If you stick to the rough suggestions in this post, and other comments on this thread, you are going to get in the ballpark of where you are wanting to go, and then you just fine tune to your personal preference.  And if you manage to make truly dangerous coffee.. make sure to repost the recipe.. I think I could use some of that right about now!!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Cold Espresso with moka pot</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I bought a moka pot few moths ago and I've enjoyed brewing "espresso" with it. I wonder if it would be possible to make cool my espresso so I can drink it the next day. It would be handy if I could just brew espresso and take it the next morning and drink it at school so that I don't need to do the brewing in hurry before school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen some tutorials or guides, but they don't seem to utilize moka pot. Instead they brew the coffee just by throwing coffee to water and put it to freezer for 12 or 24h.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried simply putting a shot of espresso to freezer and it tasted horrible the next day. I sealed the shot glass with plastic wrap...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is if there is a way to make cold espresso that would taste good after cooling it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The moka pot is by design unsuitable for a cold brew. In a moka pot, the water in the lower compartment is brought to a boil and the resulting steam pushes the hot water through the grounds in the middle basket into the upper part of the pot. So no steam, no pressure, no "espresso". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cold brew works by playing with another factor of the main parameters of chemical coffee extraction (concentration/surface area, temperature, duration), namely the significantly extended extraction time. But changing the parameters will also alter the ratio of the compounds in your final brew, also known as flavour profile. Cold extractions are famous for their lighter, more floral nuances - which in an espresso roast will be overpowered by the darker roast, hence lighter roasts are typically preferred for cold brews. Also, the grind for espresso/moka is a lot finer than for cold brew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to try cold brew, find a suitable roast, grind it accordingly and follow a "recipe", at least in the beginning, until  you gain some experience. You can also search this site for Q/As tagged "cold-brew".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the moka taste in a cold version is what you are after, you could simply prepare a serving, store it in a suitable container (think mini jam jar or similar) until the next morning. Decide whether the flavour, which will change somewhat overnight, is to your liking. And our taste buds react differently to hot or cold food.- But apparently you ran that experiment already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If both versions are not really "your thing", you can save at least a bit of time by preparing the moka pot before you go to bed. Then, see if you can alter your morning routine so that you are using the n minutes it takes for the moka to sputter for some other task. &lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Why do some coffee beans produce more dust than others when ground?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that at the same grind setting (medium grind), some coffee beans produce a ton of dust when ground, while others barely have any dust. I'm thinking it has to do with the roast level, but I'm not completely sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What factors affect how much dust is produced when grinding coffee beans?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;strong&gt;Burr grinders&lt;/strong&gt; are known for more precision and consistency than blade grinders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I haven't tried a blade grinder, but &lt;a href="http://www.specialty-coffee-advisor.com/how-to-grind-coffee.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Specialty Coffee says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, once the grinder is loaded, don't just hold the button down and let it rip... use short bursts of a few seconds each so the coffee doesn't overheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have a hold on the top of the unit and give it a shake during bursts so that the grounds get well mixed while grinding. This will make the grind much smoother and consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful that some &amp;quot;burr grinders&amp;quot; have blades and burrs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;strong&gt;Cold beans&lt;/strong&gt; grind more consistently. Per &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/science/coffee-freeze-beans-grind.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to achieve consistent flavor you may just need to chill your beans before grinding them. Colder beans produce smaller, more consistently sized particles when ground, yielding more flavor from less coffee, according to a &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep24483" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in Scientific Reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As room temperatures vary and grinders heat up with use, the consistency of the resulting grind changes. That’s a problem, because water extracts flavor from smaller coffee grounds faster than bigger ones. An inconsistent grind means sour taste from the small grains, and a bitter one from the big, all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(But I'm pretty sure that last sentence is reversed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that some grinders heat up with use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Different bean types, roasts, and ages might produce more dust than others when ground, but I don't have good info on that.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Increase cold brew coffee concentration</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I like the taste of cold brew coffee but I prefer to drink it hot. A certain proportion in which I dilute the concentrate with boiling water gives me the best taste, but the temperature of drink gets too low (even when the concentrate is at room temperature, I imagine it will be even lower if the concentrate is refrigerated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My concentrate is brewed in proportion 1:4 (coffee to water by mass). That's the highest concentration most recipes suggest. I also tried using finer grinds and increasing the extraction time (up to 30 hours).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to solve the problem would be to try proportions 1:3 and 1:2, but would I be wasting too much coffee this way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way would be to heat the drink, but that's inconvenient in office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could try boiling down the concentrate, but I'm afraid this will affect the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have other suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You should reduce your coffee concentrate by placing it in a vacuum to lower the boiling point of the water down to room temperature. Lowering the pressure of water decreases its boiling point. This way you will boil off the water quickly without adding heat and risking any changes in flavor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you can put your coffee concentrate in an oven on a low heat setting poured into a glass or ceramic baking pan to maximize the surface area. Use the convection setting if you have it. The added heat shouldn't cause too much of a flavor change since the coffee beans have been removed at this point and won't continue to brew/extract harsh flavors. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there any specific orientation when using ESE pod?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Recently I got Handpresso POP.
At first I used ground coffee, but it makes huge mess on my office desk through whole brewing process.
So, I bought some ESE pods. It was way easier and cleaner than using ground coffee. Really satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after that, I got two problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I make espresso with pods, it's noticeably weaker than ground coffee. Actually, I've already expected that because of pod's paper wrapping, but it's way over my expectation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I close portafilter after put pod, sometimes water leaks from valve. After few tries with pods, I discovered that water leakage occurs when I put pod into pod adapter with certain orientation. When I touch pod's surface, I can feel one side is little thicker than other, and I got leakage when put thicker side down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here's my question - is there are any specific orientation when using ESE pod? I heard that illy's ESE pod have certain orientation when using it, but I can't assure it's same with other pods.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;They never mentioned about the orientation in their &lt;a href="http://www.eseconsortium.com/eng/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;own site&lt;/a&gt;. Both sides should work. My experience also overlaps with that. However, as this is an open standard, some producer may produce an ESE in a bit different way.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Are there places in Belgium or netherlands where you can buy coffee green beans for agricultural reasons?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I want to grow my own coffee tree from the seed in my home in Belgium but I can't find living coffee beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a local coffee enterprise(Miko Turnhout) to ask for unburned seeds (green beans). They told me that their green beans are already neutralized(killed) so they don’t germinate during the transport. I looked online to buy green beans but I only could buy it in large amounts (min. 1kg) and it was very expensive because it had to travel from southern hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there places in Belgium where you can buy coffee green beans for agricultural reasons? Or are there websites where you can order a small amount of coffee green beans without shipping them from the other side of the world?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there a composition available about how the main parameters influence coffee taste?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There's lots of information available about the influence of various parameters on coffee taste, but it's scattered across the internet. On top of that, most answers and articles are packed with paragraphs of text and data to support the writers claims and findings. That's wonderful, but it makes it very time consuming to dig through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'd be nice to have a clean composition and presentation of a selection of the most important parameters that define coffee taste. You know, with fancy graphs about coffee developing a bitter or sour taste over time or temperature, different extracting methods, or qualitative relationships. If there's no such thing available, we could compose it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found a few of those &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/16/how-does-the-temperature-of-the-water-affect-the-taste-of-the-coffee"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off/166#166"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; already, one even with a fancy graph.(though without axis units) To narrow down my search a bit, i'm looking for parameters that affect the coffee in the post-roasting stadium, as I won't do the growing or roasting myself. I'm using arabica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking of the following parameters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage temperature  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods of grinding  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grain size when grounded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time between grinding/brewing  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water temperature at brewing  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type of water used for extraction(mineral/tap/decalcified)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods of extraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter material/size etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact time of coffee with the water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time between brewing/consuming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee temperature at consuming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how they affect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caffeine content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitterness, acidity/sourness, saltiness, and sweetness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aftertaste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heaviness of the feel in your mouth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;in the post roasting scenario here is a succinct article:&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why do I feel nauseous from coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I really love coffee but for last 6 months I've felt nauseous almost every time I drink it. If I drink an espresso in the morning I will most likely vomit. If I drink it after lunch or a few hours after I wake up (4-5 hours) then I will feel nausea but I probably won't throw up. I don't feel any of those effects from any amount of Red Bull or similar energy drinks therefore I don't think it's about the caffeine. For the record I hate energy drinks and don't won't to drink them in the morning or ever, but I had to sometimes, and I drank like a lot and never felt any nausea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem actually started 3 years ago and it lasted for about a year and a half. Then it stopped and for a year I could drink coffee anytime without any negative side effects, but the problem re-emerged 6 months ago.
I'm desperate because I really love coffee and I'm really used to that extra energy boost coffee gives me in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm male and I'm 23 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I only know of two connections between coffee and nausea. The first is caffein withdrawal, which in your case obviously doesn't apply. Secondly there is some evidence, although it far from being clear, that coffee might be bad for people suffering from reflux disease. See for example &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gerd/coffee-tea#modal-close" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to that source, gastroesophageal reflux might be triggered by coffee (among others). However it is far from clear, that it really does with studies showing that dropping coffee consumption doesn't significantly change the symptoms to the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest you talk about this with a doctor or dietary specialist. This is pure speculation, but maybe you are allergic/intolerant to one of the compounds found in coffee or it is some kind of psychosomatic response. The expectation of becoming nauseous after drinking coffee that leads to actual nausea. Maybe there was some unrelated nausea that you connected to your coffee consumption. Or maybe your nausea is entirely unrelated to the coffee and just happens to coincide with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the problem persists and a doctor couldn't help you, maybe try green/black tea. They contain caffein and can have a similar, somewhat more mellow but also more persistent energizing effect.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Qm76 Evo Quick machine building up pressure</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;We have a Qm76 Evo Quick machine. When making a double shot , using a 30psi tamper, coffee did not flow from either spout, and when removing the portafilter it seemed to be under pressure, making a mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I doing wrong? And this is all new to me. Has been ok until today. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You have an upscale espresso machine with a standard, non-pressurized portafilter. So as you know there normally isn't any pressure in the portafilter when you go to remove it after a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eghyTwFhqRo" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Backflushing&lt;/a&gt; can only be done on machines like yours that have a 3-way valve. And it's basically just putting a blind (sealed) basket or rubber disc into the portafilter and pulling three short shot cycles. That is put the portafilter, with a blind basket into the group then let the pump run for about 8 seconds, then stop the pump for a few seconds. Then repeat two more times before removing the portafilter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flushes out the brew path. Backflushing with water is safe but you shouldn't do a frequent chemical backflush on an E61 type machine. Most of the time this can be resolved by doing a backflush (sometimes you may need to do two or three backflushes) which will clean the brew path. When was the last time you did a backflush on the machine? You should be backflushing with plain water weekly. And with a food safe detergent every 200 shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the portafilter does remain under pressure it means that the "3 way over-pressure valve" that normally relieves the group pressure is sticking. Or more precisely something in the expansion chamber is sticking or the internal E61 cam isn't moving completely smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to check for scale (mineral) buildup on an E61 machine like yours is to remove the gicleur chamber nut and mushroom at the top of the E61 assembly and visually inspect the removed parts and the group head internals which will now be visible.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Iced (cold) coffee stronger than hot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Generally, it is a fact that hot drinks make us calm. That is the suggestion from doctors - to drink a hot drink before going to bed. So, is iced coffee stronger because that triggers our metabolism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the sources so far (searching on cold VS hot coffee) I have found this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Grab a cold-brewed coffee before going to the gym. Yes – coffee made
  from cold water. Surprisingly, cold brew coffee contains many
  antioxidants and healthy body boosters for better workouts. Skip the
  shakes and vitamin waters – simply power-up with a cold brew and head
  for the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link is given here:
&lt;a href="http://www.madescolabs.com/accelerate-your-weight-loss-goals-with-cold-brew-coffee/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.madescolabs.com/accelerate-your-weight-loss-goals-with-cold-brew-coffee/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am guessing the cold coffee is stronger because of the temperature (metabolism trigger) and not because of a chemical reaction with the substances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Some examples of cold (iced) coffee can be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) The greek frappe which is instant coffee (nescafe mainly), shaken with water and with extra ice cubes added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) Freddo Espresso (cold Espresso) which is a double Espresso coffee. It is then blended for 8-10 seconds with 3 big ice cubes. That releases some flavours and the final result is poured into a glass with 1-2 ice cubes. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stronger: No.&lt;/strong&gt; Subltle differences: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people who tolerate caffeine, want the longevity benefits, and looking for something gentler on your stomach with &lt;strong&gt;slightly&lt;/strong&gt; less caffeine, cold brew is your cup of joe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot brewed coffee has more anti-oxidants and a lower pH.  Cold-brewed has less acid and thus for many palates is 'milder'.  The caffeine content of the 2 is basically the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Hot brewed coffee could be better for you than cold, since heating it could increase the availability of antioxidants in your cup — but more &lt;strong&gt;research&lt;/strong&gt; is needed to determine if the benefits are significant enough to warrant making the switch.' The individual's palate so for should be the final arbiter.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I get 10 or more pounds of green coffee beans (Colombian Supremo) in a 'burlap bag'.  Should I freeze the lot of them for a few days to rid them of potential pests?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You failed to give us any details about the variety, provenance or history of your green coffee beans. Nor did you elaborate on what kind of potential pests you are worried about so all we can do is speculate vaguely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only likely pest to be found in green coffee beans is the coffee berry borer, &lt;em&gt;Hypothenemus hampei&lt;/em&gt;. This is a tiny, 2mm black beetle. And legitimate green beans would invariably have been fumigated to eradicate this pest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drying green coffee beans to critical water content levels, followed by freezing @ -15C for 2 - 6 days appears to be an effective alternative to fumigation. However this would normally be redundant to fumigation that has already taken place. And there remains some controversy about the impact of freezing upon cherry quality.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been watching pour-over method and wonder, does the equipment i have to buy to practice at home should be expensive? Im still in my 2nd year of college. What should i do to learn skills necessary to qualify to be a barista?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I am unsure if you are comjng from the perspective of someone who wants to become a barista or someone who is interested in making quality coffee at home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion learning how to brew quality espresso, and the different factors that effect a quality espresso and espresso drinks is most challenging and also requires the most knowledge (how to prepare the grinds, the whole milk steaming/foaming process etc.) it also requires expensive equipment unfortunately. I think these skills would be good if you are looking for a barista job though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For brewing at home i think you should master the french press which is a very inexpensive method to brew coffee (french press being like $20 for a good one) but is also my favorite coffee brewing method. It is also very simple to brew, you just have to make sure you get the correct ratio (using a scale is best) of water to coffee and grind the beans well (a burr grinder is best but can be kinda expensive. This would be a cost of any brewing method should you decide to grind your own beans). &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>My home machine is broke. The single basket works but the double basket doesn't. Can baskets be broken/worn out?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My sunbeam em5600 coffee machine isn't working. It's worked unreliably but now it seems to be consistently not working. Plenty of water comes from the showerhead when there's no group handle in. I am able to get steam  from the steamer but it runs out of steam quickly. I can't get any hot water stream from the steam wand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I put a single basket in the group handle it works. When I put fine or coarse or nothing in the double basket nothing comes out anymore. I have occasionally seen a drop of water coming out over the top when the group handle is in but nothing more so I don't think it's the rubber ring. When I take the group handle out after a failed attempt there is a squeak noise so there definitely water built up under some sort of pressure. I soaked the baskets in vinegar for at least 12 hours last night, didn't help. I cleaned the machine every few months which is far more often than what the manual recommends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For as long as I've had the machine which I got used I find the large water reserve can't fall below half for the machine to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do tend to aim for a very fine espresso grind, but it works in the single basket. My grounds have never formed the hard biscuit that you get when using professional machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a simple fix here like a new ring or basket or is it the water pump? If so how hard would it be to replace on my own?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's basically impossible for us to know what exactly causes the problem, but it does seem to me as if the basket is clogged with something. Probably built up residues of the coffee and fiber that's stuck in the small holes. It could of course be the pump, but then water would definitely flow out if you run it empty and the single basket should be affected as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's clogged filter you can try soaking it in hot water with an espresso machine cleaning detergent over night. But since you already soaked it in vinegar I don't think that would be fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also, carefully, put the porta filter over a gas stove to burn the residue. Hold it over the flame for a bit until it gets hot enough to burn it, then tap it against your kitchen table or some other heat resistant surface. That should do the trick. Afterwards you can clean it again normally and it should work again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly you can of course push through the holes with a very thin needle, but that is quite tedious work and would take a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if the beans need to be ground finely for &lt;em&gt;crema&lt;/em&gt; to be achieved or if the way a french press works doesn't allow for it to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;To answer this it's important to understand what Crema actually is. Roasted coffee consists of somewhere around a thousand different substances, among which are aromatic oils, sugars, caffein, fiber and carbon dioxide trapped inside the beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crema consists mainly of those oils, sugars, some proteins and importantly the CO2 gas trapped inside the bean. When an espresso machine pushes water through the grounds with high pressure, it emulsifies the fats/oils, dissolves some sugars and traps it all in little CO2 bubbles. The CO2 is forced out of the grounds through the high pressure. That's why you have considerably less crema if you use old, stale coffee. Because most of the CO2 trapped inside has evaporated already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to your actual question. For the obvious reason, that is the lack of pressure in a French Press, Crema can not form. There can be some kind of foam, just as with pour overs, but it's not crema. It's not going to last long and will usually dissolve very quickly. If you were to create such a pressure in a French Press (which I highly doubt is technically even possible, since after all you want to brewed coffee to go through the mesh filter, but not the grounds), you would likely have crema forming on the bottom where the grounds settled and then rising to the top, just as it does when you pull a shot of espresso. Order an espresso shot in a transparent shot glass once and observe how the coffee flows out in the beginning as a mixture of coffee and crema and then observe the crema rising to the top, I heard people call it Guinness effect.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Do all Chemex brand filters fit all Chemex brewers the same?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;We recently got a new Chemex pot and it seems like the same filters fit the new pot differently than they fit the old. Both pots are the 10 cup. The new has wood handle, the old has glass handle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone seen a pattern as to which filters fit certain Chemex pots best?  Or should it be same across the whole board?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;According to the official &lt;a href="https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for the Chemex products, the filters available for the Chemex are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CHEMEX BONDED FILTERS PRE-FOLDED CIRCLES &lt;strong&gt;(FC-100)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CHEMEX BONDED FILTERS PRE-FOLDED SQUARES &lt;strong&gt;(FS-100)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CHEMEX BONDED FILTERS PRE-FOLDED SQUARES (NATURAL) &lt;strong&gt;(FSU-100)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CHEMEX BONDED FILTERS UNFOLDED HALF MOON &lt;strong&gt;(FP-2)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10 cups Chemexes, are:
 - TEN CUP GLASS HANDLE CHEMEX (CM-10GH)
 - TEN CUP CLASSIC CHEMEX (CM-10A)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which both uses the same filters:
 Use CHEMEX Bonded Filters FP-1, &lt;strong&gt;FC-100, FS-100, FSU-100&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dimensions for both Chemex are the same (at least, height and diameter), so the shape should be the same. My opinion is that it's just an illusion that feels like the filters fit in a different way. Maybe you can put a filter both side to side and compare them :P &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer the FS-100 (the square corners comes very handy when removing the filter), but given that all filters &lt;em&gt;have the same size&lt;/em&gt; (when it comes to filtering area), all of them should behave equally (except the natural vs bleached).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are the basics of creating an espresso blend?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Having roasted almost exclusively single origins, tackling blends seems somewhat daunting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the basic elements of an espresso blend that make it particularly good for the espresso application, over and against a non-espresso blend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What comprises an espresso blend?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The basics of blending consists of finding the lost flavors of one specific single origin bean in another bean. Therefore perfecting both (or many) beans in the same cup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, a good blend mostly has many axes. For example, the timing is important. Palate has a base, mid flavors and finishing flavors. When you taste the cup you first taste the base, then the middle flavors. Finishing flavors remain for a while. A blend tries to balance this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the balance in between sweetness, bitterness could be managed with the selected single origin beans. Acidity or body could be set to desired levels. All of these could be crafted on all axes to perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The espresso blend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the preparation technique, espresso is acidic and less bodily then its counterparts. As a result, when espresso blends are prepared, less acidic and more bodily origins are preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another observable difference in espresso blends is their roast. Darker roasts makes any origin less acidic and more bodily. So, many espresso blends are roasted a bit darker than normal to achieve a better flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it possible to make a frothy coffee without an espresso machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm a coffee lover and my day starts with coffee but as i moved in my house i lost the coffee machine so i wanted to know &lt;strong&gt;how to make a perfect coffee without the machine?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Actually, the silky wet milk foam may be a problem if you cannot easily reach a steam wand. However, froth is quite easy. All you need to do is fill the milk texture with small air bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice tool to do this could be your French press. After preparing your coffee in a French-press, swiftly clean it and fill it with some milk. Pump the filter in and out for a while. This will inject small air bubbles inside the milk, so the milk quickly turns into textured froth. Then, you can use it as a topping for the previously brewed French-press coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not exactly same as any espresso-based foamy beverage just like cappuccino. But, the result may resemble it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Best technique to make latte art with an Aeroccino 3?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I want to know which are the best practices to make latte art with the Aeroccino 3. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which level of milk is optimal? Should I use the maximum for hot mark, maximum for cold mark or somewhere below or between the marks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should I use the whisk with or without the spring?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I need a metal milk jug?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem is that the milk turns out too foamy, and I believe it should be denser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also find that the milk will be separated with the foam quite fast so you need to immediately pour the milk out of the can.
Shaking the can also help a lot as the milk will again emerge with foam and give silky result. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does espresso cost more to make than drip coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;In US coffee shops, espresso costs more than drip coffee (say, $3 for espresso vs. $2.50 for drip coffee where I live). Is that because espresso is seen (in the US) as fancy? Or does it actually cost more to brew?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The primary factor is that it takes considerably more effort and skill to make an espresso than drip coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good espresso requires a far more expensive piece of machinery which requires greater upkeep and the barista needs to pay far more attention to what he is doing. The barista needs to pack the coffee correctly; pay attention to the water pressure and the resulting crema. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of grinding the coffee and putting in the correct amount of water a drip coffee does not require much work or attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you're providing espresso for your customers you need a far more expensive grinder, an expensive and finicky machine (the espresso maker) an employee who has had to undergo far more extensive training and said employee needs to be paying attention to what he is doing for each and every cup of espresso he is making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this adds to increased cost. Plus customers are willing to wait, and pay a few cents more for an espresso done right. As opposed to paying less and having an espresso in name only.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;Ive tried brewing espresso in a moka pot but I end up making coffee that tastes like drip coffee.

I'd like to get the consistency of an espresso shot made by an espresso machine (thick and creamy). I've been following tutorials online but nothing changes!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You can create more pressure if you will use finer grind (but be careful). I even tamp a bit (but be careful again). You can also buy Bialetti Brikka, which has a pressure valve - it helps to build higher pressure and create crema. However, with moka pot you'll never get real espresso, you can only try to brew something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How long does sealed ground coffee retain its flavors?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Assuming I purchase freshly ground coffee from a shop which sell it sealed. How long can I store it before it begins to lose its flavor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sealed here means the sealed packets which we get from supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;To answer your question properly it is necessary to explain what coffee beans actually consist of. Around 50% of the coffee bean are carbohydrates, some of them soluble (like sucrose), but most of them are not (they add to body and mouthfeel though as non soluble substances in your cup). Other important parts are acids, such as chlorogenic acid, fatty acids, caffein obviously, proteins and other volatile flavor compounds. There are around 1000 of these volatile flavor compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the beans are roasted CO2 gas is developed and stored inside the bean. It's a natural oxidation inhibitor as it prevents oxygen from reaching the bean. When you are grinding the beans almost immediately most of the CO2 gas is exhausted. Simultaneously the surface area of the bean is exponentially increased. That means that oxygen has a much larger surface area to "attack" plus the gas protecting these volatile flavor compounds vanishes almost instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oxidation starts and in 15min. around 60% of these the volatile flavor compounds are evaporated. That is why most pre ground coffee beans smell almost identical when you open the packages, independently of the bean origin. What remains as flavorful compounds are the proteins, that have mostly undergone Maillard reactions, making them rather bitter, the sucrose, caffein and some acids like chlorogenic acid. All beans (Arabica) contain those in more or less the same quantities. The flavor compounds that contribute to origin specific flavors are mostly gone by the time you open up a package of preground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus to answer your question, coffee goes stale almost immediately after grinding. The coffee in the packages you buy in the supermarket is pretty much already stale when they pack it in the factories. Hence you can probably keep an unopened package for about a year before you will note further significant impacts on the flavor, it will just keep getting more bitter as oxidation continues.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is coffee/caffeine addictive?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've heard that people get addicted. In other words, if someone has coffee regularly and they skip a day, then on that day they feel "low" or perform worse than they used to when they weren't a coffee drinker. Put another way, coffee no longer gives them a "boost"; rather, they need it to perform on par with when they weren't a coffee drinker. Is this true? What is your experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice is appreciated. :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have seen some blend coffeees available in the market, both ground as well as instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to know what ratio is preferred normally while mixing Arabica and Robusta?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Country : India&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is highly dependent on the market, I think. Still, based on my observations regarding corporate Italian espresso blenders, I would like to write a short answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you purchase packaged coffee, which is not labeled as 100% Arabica, you are mostly buying from 10% to 30% Robusta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I would like to add, some quality Robusta's (especially Africans) may be superior to not so good Arabica's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the ratio of Robusta may go up to 50% in some house blends or horeca blends. You may even consume pure Robusta in Indonesia or in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Milk texturing issues on commercial machine!</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just spent the day making coffees for a work function. They hired an expobar commercial coffee machine and I failed to get one nice jug of milk all day, no matter what I tried it was always frothy with visible bubbles. I remember when I did my barista course I was doing great with milk texturing on various machines then was put on a machine which was doing something very similar to today. For anyone that uses these machines for a living, is there something that can cause this? Pressure too high perhaps? Or operator error? Although I doubt the last, I tried literally everything. I did notice it had a very small wand so I had trouble submerging it very far, but far enough that I was introducing air. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see you are already experienced. Still, I can give a basic recipe that may help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should introduce hot air of course for bubbles and also to heat the milk up.  Make circles with the wand inside the milk. Around 70 degrees Celsius is known to be good for heating milk for bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you should stay on the surface. The wand should make some angle with the normal, so occasionally wand is in the thin surface of milk and air. There you can hear some hissing and whistling sound. Hearing the "paper tearing" sounds on the surface is important and told that they introduce micro bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you can quickly (to not overheat) repeat these two to push the micro bubbles formed on the surface to the bottom of the jug and form new micro bubbles on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not forget to knock the jug to a massive wooden surface to push the liquid milk to the bottom and place the foam to the top of the jug after you finish.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>When the espresso begins to pour it takes about 3-5 secound to reach the right presure, what can I do?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Hello I have some problems when trying to get a perfect shot of espresso&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt;
So when the espresso begins to pour, the pressure is not high enought, and the color is dark. It takes about 3-5 seconds to reach the right presure and the right color. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what can I do to get the right pressure when the espresso begins to pour out?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The equitment I'm using is:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine: Sage Barista express&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grinder: Mahlkönig Vario grinder (Right now the grind size i'm using is 3.d)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beans roasting date: 19/06.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using about 16g of grind coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm Tamping at about 15kg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extraction time is about 22.4 secound from I press the 'double shot' button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I have tried:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I try to use a finer grind the pressure will just get way to high, but still use about 3-5 secound to reach espresso range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I try to use a coarser grind the pressure will never reach the espresso range.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is completely normal, this is the pre-infusion phase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-infusion is used to wet the grounds before starting ideal espresso extraction. Wetting with hot water helps the grounds to release initial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, therefore enables more and even extraction surface. &lt;em&gt;It somewhat resembles blooming in pour-over manual filtering.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, you should feel lucky that you have this feature on your machine. By the way, I take a look and found this explanation on &lt;a href="https://sageappliances.co.uk/products/barista-express?variant=40400693188" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Sage's website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pre Infusion Function:
  Gradually increases water pressure to gently expand grinds for an even extraction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And a final note to enhance your cup of espresso...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I can  see, you end up in 22.4 - 5 = 17.4 seconds, which is pretty fast. The common practice is 1 ml in 1 second; therefore you should fill a 30 ml espresso in 30 seconds (with double spouts a doppio will take the same amount of time 60 ml in 30 seconds.) I recommend you try to fix timing first to see if you can get better results.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can the MahlKoenig EK43 be calibrated coarser?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;We just got in our new EK43; When we dial in to highest grind size (11 on our dial), it is much finer than what I would normally use for French Press, or even for Chemex or automatic drip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some pictures of grounds around a penny, to compare size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting 1:
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u1PpW.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u1PpW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Au6xB.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Au6xB.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting 11:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wayPR.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wayPR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes you can adjust the calibration of grind size of the EK43.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have the grinder plugged in and ready. Turn the adjustment knob all the way to the right. Losen the two screws on the sides of the knob slightly (turn the hexagon shaped screwdriver once). The screws are on the sides of the knob, fixing the big adjustment screw in the middle of the knob. Once they are losend you can use a flat head screwdriver or a coin to turn the screw in the middle of the know. Keep the knob totally turned to the right, to the smallest grind size setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now normally you would turn it slowly to the right while your grinder is turned on until you hear a slight rattling sound. This sound occurs when the burrs are touching. Once you hear the sound, immediately turn the screw back by about ten degrees until the sound stops and the burrs aren't touching anymore. That is the standard calibration and the only one viable for espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your case you want to turn the screw further counter clockwise, so the burrs are further apart until you get the desired grind size. The maximum grind size will be coarser as well as the minimum. That also means that the grinder will not grind fine enough for espresso anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know if this is recommendable to do, I don't think anything can break. But I will also not guarantee it. To be sure write a mail to Mahlkönig. Also I think there are instructions in the grinder manual on how to calibrate it (to the standard espresso setting).&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I’ve started trying Trader Joe’s whole bean coffee that comes in canisters. When I opened one today and poured the beans into the grinder, I noticed there was some moisture inside the can that I had not remembered ever seeing. The can says “nitrogen flushed can to help ensure freshness”. The can was fully sealed so I don’t believe anything happened after-market. Is it safe to assume the wetness inside the can is due to the nitrogen flushing or should I be concerned it’s something else abnormal?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Are you sure it is water? If you bought a dark roast, there is a distinct possibility that there is a bit of oil in the coffee. 
Another possibility is a minor machine malfunction during the roasting process. With large scale coffee roasters, a small amount of water is sprayed directly into the drum just before dumping to "quench" the coffee and speed the cooling process. Almost all of this water evaporates immediately under normal circumstances. As a technician in the coffee industry, I have seen a couple issues that caused more water to go into the beans than intended, and the whole batch had to be thrown out. 
Hopefully it ends up being oil. In either case, as long as the coffee isn't moldy or foul smelling, it should be just fine. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Sweating due to coffee intake</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I sweat a lot. I have tried so many methods to combat sweating but none of it worked. Antiperspirants and other home remedies didn't work at all. I don't have enough money to go for botox or other expensive treatments as I'm saving it for something else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a coffee addict. I can't function without at least 5 cups of coffee daily. Is it true that coffee consumption will result in sweating? If yes, how can I reduce my coffee intake? (I'm not a fan of decaf).  &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coffee can cause some sweating when consumed in very high dosages. Your core temperature increases because of central nervous system activation and your body tries to regulate temperature. However 5 cups a day don't seem close to an overdose unless your caffeine tolerance is very low and studies have shown that normal dosages of caffeine intake don't alter core temperature or increase sweating to an extent where it would affect your hydration (see e.g. McLellan et. al 2016 for a Review). It still might be noticeable if you sweat a lot in general. I would just trial and error it by not drinking coffee for a few days. You might notice increased sweating for a day or two from withdrawal but that should pass after a couple of days. However these "health" websites have a lot of misinformation on them that are not scientifically supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I make my Turkish coffee immune to brewing temperature?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I want to design Turkish coffee, but I keep finding that the taste is widely affected by the person who brewes the coffee and the temperature at which he does it.
I want to make my coffee immune to brewing temperature and techniques as much as possible, what should I do?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever you do, Turkish brewing mostly reflects the proper technique.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, if you really consider temperature stability as your first concern; there is something you can do. Try to keep the temperature of the &lt;em&gt;cezve&lt;/em&gt; intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, you need lots of metal to evenly share and distribute the thermal capacity. But... Turkish coffee brewing must be done so quickly. Somewhere around 80 seconds at all. Then, you also need thermal connectivity; which boils down to thick copper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, copper may be poisonous; so, it is plated. Better option is silver for better thermal connectivity. Second, cheaper option is tin. As you see, even a single cezve may cost a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think your technique is advanced, stainless steel may do based on your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please see this previous answer:&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Book recommendation: a guide about coffee to a beginner?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I really want to learn more about coffee, but I think the web is too large and therefore confusing. So I have decided to start with a good book. Which books (preferably below 20 USD) can you recommend? Just a good and informative beginner guide to espresso and coffee in general?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I recommend Hoffman's "&lt;strong&gt;The World Atlas of Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;." 
 He gives you history, tells you about different methods of brewing, roasting, and teaches about growing and processing as well.  A very well rounded introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far as a book focussed more on brewing, I recommend Rao's "&lt;strong&gt;The Professional Barista's Handbook&lt;/strong&gt;."  His blog (also linked below) is also a tremendous source.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much caffeine delivered by eating coffee grounds</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I eat coffee grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have size 000 capsules (just think of the size of the largest supplement capsules you may have seen), a capsule maker, and some Death Wish (which they tout as premium Ruousto, with "twice the caffeine" (that's their marketing line)) coffee, ground to regular drip coffee maker standards (as delivered by the company, to me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tamp the ground coffee into those capsules; it's pretty densely compacted.
Naturally, I get a bit more caffeine per quantity than as brewed (any method) or as would come from Arabica, but, how many milligrams per capsule, roughly?
Anyone able to venture a guess?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Well, eating coffee beans provides you with much more caffeine than drinking coffee. In comparison with the 95 milligrams in 1 cup of brewed coffee, a 28-bean serving of dark chocolate-covered coffee beans contains 336 milligrams of caffeine. So if your capsules could hold one bean, lets say, that would be roughly 12 milligrams of caffeine per bean.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What should be the daily coffee intake?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am from Pakistan. Summers here are very hot. My question is how many cups of coffee are recommended as a daily intake in summers? should the daily intake of coffee vary in summers and winters?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This, or similar questions have been answered a few times. Each time, they are phrased a bit differently with new perspectives, so I would like to answer these, also add the previous discussions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in the reverse order, drinking coffee in alternating seasons should not matter. Actually, this boils down how much water your metabolism consume in summer or in winter time. As well as, how much water you consumed: plain or in coffee form -which is more common. In Coffee SE, we have discussed caffeine related dehydration a few times, where the following two discussions has extended answers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/149/does-coffee-cause-dehydration"&gt;Does coffee cause dehydration?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, as the second part of your question whether there exists a limit for coffee consumption? Yes, there is. Actually, the limit for caffeine intake is so high that under normal conditions even the water you consumed together with your coffee become deadly at that point. Still, if you want to see the answer it is here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, finally, you may wonder whether is there a suggested amount. Yes, there is:&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Single shot extraction time in Breville Barista Express</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have got a Breville Barista Express just before a couple of days and I am trying to make the best single espresso shot I can make with this machine at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last two days I was playing and changing with the settings of the machine to reach to the signs of the good single espresso shot as described on the internet... they are saying that the pressure gauge needle has to point to 12 o'clock.... I don't know if that is correct ... anyways I have reached to that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But on the internet, they also say that the extraction time for a single shot should be 20 seconds ... in my case it is 15 sec. .... what is wrong?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please know that I am using the single shot single wall basket, and a Starbucks medium roast coffee beans that was produced before 5 months.  &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem seems like either in the dosage or in the tamping force or in the grind size.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First, I advise you to use freshly roasted beans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know what is the pressure value at 12 o'clock position, but I assume it is correct. Now, let's check what could have been happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have less coffee grounds so the water travels a short distance in the coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you tamp lightly so water channels through the coffee instead of extracting flavors from the grounds by pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your grind is too coarse, so that water could travel faster through large boulders instead of finer sandy grounds with less extraction surface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I could suggest that you can first check your ground size, then check your tamping force (15 kg-f is more or less correct) and then the amount of ground you fill in the basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, please see these relevant discussions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2959/what-are-the-standard-espresso-parameters-dose-mass-volume-time-etc"&gt;What are the standard espresso parameters (dose, mass/volume, time, etc.)?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>What types of coffee make you stay awake?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I want to know that types of coffee that make me stay awake because I usually work at night.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The short answer is pretty obvious. Any coffee, as long as it's not decaffeinated, keeps you awake. While that is true, it is also true that some coffees have more caffein than others, some preparation methods contain more caffein than others and the ability of any coffee to keep you awake has obviously also limitations. If you are close to passing out from fatigue, than coffee also won't help that much anymore. I'm gonna break it all down quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two commercially important types of coffee beans. Arabica and Robusta. Arabica plants produce higher quality coffee with better and more complex flavors. However in terms of caffein content Robusta coffee is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee#cite_note-Bunker-160" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;much higher&lt;/a&gt; with roughly twice the caffein in the brewed cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee preparation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking you could divide coffee preparation into two different groups. Espresso and everything else. Everything else has many sub groups that I'm not gonna get into too much now. The common understanding is that espresso is "stronger" with which is meant that it has more caffein than other coffee drinks. That is true when you measure per ml. However due to the small servings of espresso the &lt;a href="http://www.coffeescience.org/caffeine-coffee/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;caffein content&lt;/a&gt; of one shot of espresso is lower than that of a typical cup of filter coffee. An espresso shot contains roughly 53mg of caffein while a cup of drip coffee has more than twice to three times as much (115mg to 175mg) due to the bigger serving size. Turkish coffee has even higher contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So based on this information I would recommend you to slowly drink several cups of brewed or filtered Arabica coffee during your night shifts. That should keep you caffeinated and awake more effectively than espresso plus you get to drink delicious coffee all night long. The maximum caffein content you would get with a turkish style preparation, in my opinion the best trade off between caffein and flavor would be drip coffee though. It's lighter in taste so you can drink more as well. I would recommend Arabica for the better taste and possible health benefits as compared to Robusta. You don't have to be afraid of negative health effects. Coffee is largely redeemed and is today even considered a healthy beverage with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee#Health_effects" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;possible positive effects&lt;/a&gt; on cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, some forms of cancer, degenerative diseases of the nervous system such as Alzheimers and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does coffee help if you are tired because you have over slept?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;If you have over slept and was drowsy because of this, would coffee give you an effective boost to get your day started or would you be better off with something like a sugary soda?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coffee is an excellent countermeasure against drowsiness in general. The main and best understood mechanism of action of caffeine is that it blocks the receptors of adenosine in your brain. Adenosine is responsible for the feeling of drowsiness. It accumulates throughout the day and would act to make you feel increasingly tired. In addition caffeine likely has effects on your dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline levels. They are all chemicals  considered to be excitatory neurotransmitters. Nehlig et al. (1992) made an extensive review of the action mechanisms of caffeine. A more recent review was published by MacLellan et al. (2016).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drowsiness from oversleeping occasionally probably stems from a disruption of your cycadian rhythm. If you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle before completing it, you will feel groggy and tired. Caffeine will certainly have some effect through the stimulation of your central nervous system and the increased release of stimulating neurotransmitters. But so would a morning work out or a walk in the sun. Which one is more effective for you, you will have to trial and error. I'd combine them I guess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic oversleeping however should be considered a medical issue. Hypersomnia could be a symptom for many other, more serious issues ranging from sleep apnea to depression and other neurological diseases. In these cases caffeine might have positive or negative effects. But that is a question you should ask to your physicians.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it possible to overdose on coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm asking this question because I overheard someone talking about needing at least two cups of coffee in the morning to &lt;em&gt;"function properly"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, they said this while drinking ANOTHER cup of coffee and then went on to have ANOTHER refill ~10-20 minutes later, and all of this was 3-4 hours after they woke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm no genius, but surely this &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; be healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have several questions regarding the matter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you die from a &lt;em&gt;"coffee overdose"&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of health problems could you get from drinking too much coffee?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is it possible for someone to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; coffee to function, is it like how an addict needs drugs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone who's &lt;em&gt;"addicted"&lt;/em&gt; to coffee stops drinking it, would that person suffer from withdrawal symptoms?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, for the sake of curiousity, are there any recorded cases of a &lt;em&gt;"coffee overdose"&lt;/em&gt;? I've looked around but can't find any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good overview of caffeine overdose can be found on &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-overdose" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;healthline&lt;/a&gt;. Some outakes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caffeine overdose may occur if you ingest more than [...] 400mg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 oz. black coffee has 260mg of caffeine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dizziness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increased thirst&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;insomnia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;headache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;irritability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trouble breathing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vomiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hallucinations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;confusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chest pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;irregular or fast heartbeat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uncontrollable muscle movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;convulsions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevention is kinda obvious, but I will quote it for completeness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent a caffeine overdose, avoid consuming excessive amounts of
caffeine. In most cases, you shouldn’t have more than 400 mg of
caffeine per day and even less if you’re particularly sensitive to
caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer to your last two questions is that one can be addicted to or dependent on caffeine. In a &lt;a href="http://psycnet.apa.org.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/fulltext/2012-04931-001.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2012 study investigating caffeine dependence&lt;/a&gt; they found that a staggering 96% of subjects had withdrawal symptoms when taken off caffeine and thus had a physical dependence. The article goes into a lot more detail for each of your questions and has a few more good references. So if you want to investigate further that I would suggest that as a good jumping of point.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Time to bin Pod machines?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Finished with pod machines, bad for the environment.
Decided on ground coffee machine, looked at De Longhi Dedica up to now, New Sage/Breville Bambino Plus looks good, but £400!! nevertheless, if it does the job!
Need advice from some knowledgible chaps on here...require good machine plus decent grinder, also good Microfoam for Latte Art&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I got a Delonghi Magnifica ESAM3300 bean to cup machine recently. It grinds the beans, makes the coffee, and cleans itself.  It is as easy as pods, but I get to use any coffee beans I want, without pods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Magnifica costs about $525 US, which is about as expensive as the Breville.  However, when you do the math, it is not that bad, except that it requires a larger up front investment. Plus, you do not need to buy a grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I compared to a Keurig machine which will cost around $100 US, and uses pods that cost between $0.50 or $0.90 per cup. My favorite coffee beans sell for about $12 for 2 lbs (thank you, Costco), which translates to about $0.10 per cup in the Magnifica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I computed that the Magnifica initial and operating cost will break even with the Keurig cost in much less than a year.  No pod waste either. No coffee grounds all over my counters due to static electricity from a separate grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I love the machine. I get great crema and a lovely cup at the push of a button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The machine has a dual block system to ensure that the manual steam wand is ready to go.  However, I do not know enough to tell you if the frothier produces appropriate microfoam for latte art.  It makes good cappuccino and latte, as far as I am concerned, but I am not an artist about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister has had this machine for over 10 years with no problems, so I am confident in the reliability of grinder, infuser, and overall system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can find a store than carries them, you might see if you can get a demo.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are some really amazing Robustas that give body and crema to espresso shots.

  <title>Is there a scale with a usb interface for tracking data?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Instead of manually writing down the brew process I try each day (example: 18g beans, 40g water @ 0:00; 180g water @ 0:45; etc), I would love my scale to be connected directly to my computer. Then I can just pour water (using a pour over on the scale) and my computer automatically tracked the data. I'm a programmer, so I have zero problems writing a program to collect the data, and then even present a UI with a form where I can rate the taste of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I can't find a good scale that has a usb interface to the computer. And even the few I find that say "usb", it only mentioned it for power supply, not computer interfacing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does such a scale exist?&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;There are many coffee lovers all over the world and coffee is becoming in fashion and an addiction. So, which country has the highest number per capita and/or the largest population of any on earth?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;China maybe? My second option is India. As "coffee lover" is a blurry definition, I assume you wanted to ask household consumption of coffee per country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you check &lt;a href="https://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-what-the-world-drinks" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see the Northwestern Europe consumes the most coffee per person. The first country is Finland with 9.6 kg. Interestingly, contradictory to my beliefs, Italy is 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; with 3.4 kg. Also, Turkey is not included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you check the total consumption of countries, the first two countries are USA and Brazil with a very close consumption of 971 and 969 tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why should milk used for coffee not to be served too hot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Ideally the milk for coffee is steamed to 65-70 degrees Celsius. What happens if it exceeds 70 degrees? Does it affect the flavour of coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Most cafés serve coffee beverages between 155°F - 165°F, but the ideal temperature for steaming milk on a home machine is between 150°F -155°F. Temperature really only starts to matter when it comes to the type of milk your steaming because different types have different burning points ex. Soy milk will burn before whole milk so maybe steam soy at a lower temperature. Generally, milk proteins will start to break down and burn around 170°F, but basically personal preference and what tastes right to you.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does the coarseness of the ground coffee affect taste</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've just taken the plunge, and purchased an Espresso machine. (Sage Express) I'm now officially an amateur barrista in the making. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I can gather, there are two important parameters in making the best possible coffee. (Well, three actually. But I'm keeping your personal choice of coffee beans out of the equation here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First is temperature of the water. The machine takes care of that for me. Check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next is how long it takes for the water to run through the grounded beans. This should be around 25 seconds. Your personal taste may make it a bit higher or lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I've got the grinding of the beans, and how coarse or fine that should be. Does this affect the taste directly, or is that just one parameter combined with how hard the beans are pressed, that goes into how long the water takes to run through? Or does this by itself have a more direct effect on the taste?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can always try to experiment a bit, but would like to get a bit of insight beyond that. Thank you. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, coarseness of the grind influences the balance of bright and bitter flavors: coarser reduces bitter flavours, finer reduces acidic flavours. But it all interacts with the flow rate; see the diagrams in the linked article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xe8c3.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xe8c3.jpg" alt="espresso flavour diagram"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tamping pressure itself is not really a factor, you should keep this constant and only modify grind and dose.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the most environmentally friendly type of coffee filter?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;First I want to clarify I live in a city that does compost (Seattle). Also taste is not a concern for the sake of this discussion. Knowing that...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what is a more environmentally friendly choice of a type of coffee filter between...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. Unbleached paper coffee filters that are compostable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. Cloth coffee filter that is easily rinsable with hot water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know which one is the friendlier choice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it's you can also see it as a city compost vs use of hot water question.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;My choice is the Melitta “All natural bamboo filter”.
Manufacturer claims “made with 40% bamboo” and “recycled paperboard” and “100% compostable filter paper”.
I grind my beans using the Turkish setting for a super fine grind and use a hand poured one cup filter system which gives me a really super full rich taste.

  <title>Keurig K155 intermittent water level detection failure</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Keurig K155 that I use at my office and have been using it without fail for almost three years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, it keeps telling me to fill the water reservoir even though it is not empty.  Sometimes re-seating the unit will work, but it can take several times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what method the machine uses to detect water levels, nothing in the owner's manual or cleaning/maintenance manual seems to cover this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There does appear to be a small hole where it does seem that there's a glass recessed where I'm thinking there might be an "electric eye" but I can see no other visible way for it to detect water level.  I realize that's not likely it because the graphic display will show actual level, not just empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manual does refer to a "float" device, but it doesn't document it very well, and it looks like it might be difficult to get to, requiring disassembly of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit (embarrassingly) that I've never cleaned the machine in the years we've all used it.  Should that be my first step?  equal parts white vinegar and water?  Or is that likely to have no effect on my water level detection problem?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Most coffee machines use magnetic water level sensors. I do not see a reason why Keurig does not have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may see the basic idea on &lt;a href="https://standexelectronics.com/applications-markets/coffee-makers/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, I copy the animation here to make it easier to understand. So, it is normal that there are not any visible parts, as it is magnetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7wQZr.gif" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7wQZr.gif" alt="how-water-level-sensors-work"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let's focus on your problem. These kind of levels may broke for some reason from time to time. Electrical discharge, strong magnetic field near-by, and so on. I suspect that this sensor is partly broken; it cannot correctly measure the magnetic field. If this is the case, cleaning probably will not fix your problem and you need order new parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you can do? You may try to trick the sensor with a magnet. I cannot think that it is practical if you cannot really build a working mechanism for daily use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I strongly advise coffee machines to be cleared regularly. At least, mold may grow inside.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does the same coffee in my Hario V60 drip tastes better then in Bialetti stainless steel moka pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I use same beans (either Flowgrade or Bulletproof), and grind in a Rhinowares hard grinder (adjusting the screw by tightening max, and then unwind by 5 clicks). I use about 28 grams of coffee for 500 mL water in both cases. I have the 9-cup stainless steel Bialetti  moka pot, and a ceramic V60-02.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days I brew in the V60, and some days in a moka pot. The V60 coffee tastes better. From the moka pot it seems a bit sour, and lacks "coffeeness" in the taste. Why doesn't the moka coffee taste good?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As they are two different methods of brewing, it is normal that they taste different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One very clear difference is the temperature of the water. Moka pots practically use water/steam. This let's the extraction happen in a warmer environment than recommended. Additional bitter notes of the bean is also extracted. More importantly, you loose some aromatics as they evaporate quickly. However, as you don't use a fine filter, you and up with a more bodily cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V60 effectively filters out the body of the bean. Also, you brew in the recommended degree (around 95 degree Celcius). The result is a more finer, light, herbal-tea-like cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I realized that you did not mention your grind size. Grounds must be grinded in different sizes for both methods. If you use the same size, it is also another reason for the difference in the taste. In case, check &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3254/what-is-the-right-coffee-ground-size-for-an-espresso-coffee-machine/3255#3255"&gt;this discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to fix the milk frother?

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As far as I see from the photo, the Teflon coating has been swelled. If this is the case, it is an indicator that your frother have over-heated and stay in that state for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume, the heater coil switched on and off to keep the temperature stable for long. Finally, the coil burnt out itself. I don't think you can do much. Even if you change the coil, the swelled Teflon is not very healthy. I wouldn't use it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I think you're lucky that this did not cause any serious damage.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Moka pot sputters and gurgles despite my best efforts</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Videos like &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/-JLoCWOSyvU" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; show a smooth, viscous flow of coffee from the bottom of a moka pot into the top. Moreover, I've read that you should cut off the heat as soon as you start to hear a gurgling sound, lest the coffee be bitter. However, I can't reconcile either of these with the behavior of my moka pot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pot starts to sputter and gurgle as soon as the coffee starts to come up: there is never a smooth flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, if I were to cut the heat at that point, there would only be a tiny amount of coffee in the pot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume I'm doing something wrong. Here's my current procedure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hot water up to the steam release valve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bustelo grounds in the filter basket, leveled but not tamped. (Nope, not freshly ground.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low flame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off flame when gurgling becomes less steady.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What, if anything, should I be doing differently?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I make coffee with a moka every morning, and this is the procedure that works for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;cold&lt;/strong&gt; water: it will take a bit longer to boil, but the amount of steam in the chamber will be higher, thus you'll have higher pressure later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water level must be at the safety valve, as others pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee must fill the funnel without tamping. It can be a little higher than the funnel edge (a few mm) so that it gets a bit tamped when you screw the upper part. This is valid for a small-medium moka (up to 6 cups). On larger ones the coffee must not fill the funnel over 2/3 of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low flame usually gives better result, but if I'm in a hurry I use a high flame...no significant difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trick that usually works when your moka starts sputtering is to cool down the lower chamber under the tap until you don't feel any boiling on; then put it again on the fire with a &lt;strong&gt;very low&lt;/strong&gt; flame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're experiencing this problem regularly, try changing the gasket &lt;strong&gt;and the filter&lt;/strong&gt; on the bottom of the upper part. This should be done at least every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your moka is still not working as expected, consider to change it. There is a chance that lower and upper part cannot be screwed tightly because of a weared-out or malformed thread.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Whenever I froth my milk and pour it into the espresso, it dries and makes water under it. How do I fix that?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So I'm learning how to make coffee and I absolutely love it but the hardest part about it is steaming the milk. Whenever I make a latte or a capp the foam sort of rises and makes this layer of froth and but I want the froth fully in the espresso. Why does this happen and how do I fix it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Based on the following comment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No Im asking whenever I serve Lattes or capps the froth usually rises to the top and leaves water and espresso under the froth. Im told that this is wrong and Im frothing the milk wrong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I surmise that you're using a steam pipe and you're frothing the entire drink with the espresso already in the cup. The problem you're experiencing (as I understand it) is that you don't get a nice emulsion, you get some water from the steam at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on that, I'd recommend the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froth the milk separately, for example in a metal frothing jug. Add it to the espresso after frothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use cold milk, this froths better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When steaming the milk, your technique is very important. Specifically, you want the tip of the steam wand to be just below the surface of the milk. (This isn't important if you have a special steam wand which also blows in air.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Best practices for reheating coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;By the time I come home from work in the morning, a pot of coffee that was brewed by others in my house (and is still quite full) is slightly too cold by the time I am able to drink it. I don’t want to waste the resources or time brewing a fresh pot, but the coffee always tastes “off” when I microwave it. The flavor is also much worse if it is reheated after cream is in it, but even black coffee leaves much to be desired. What are the best practices for reheating coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Cold-brewed coffee heats well. Hot-brewed coffee that is old (whether on the warmer for hours or allowed to cool) will have pronounced flavors that most drinkers find unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned about wasting grounds, either brew smaller batches of hot-brewed coffee, or look into cold-brewed coffee. Most groceries carry pre-made cold brew or cold brew concentrate (read the labels to see if added water or milk is recommended), or consider getting a brewing container to make at home in the fridge. It stays good for 7-10 days once brewed so you can purchase or make a week's worth at a time. &lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;We bought a new Lavazza A Modo Mio recently, and can’t seem to program it to make a larger cup. It says to hold the button down for 3 seconds and keep holding until cup is full. All it does give small shots which takes endless pressing to fill a cup. What are we doing wrong ? &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much volume of the shot should pre-infusion take up?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The espresso machine I use at work has a pre-infusion step. I've been wondering if the volume of the pre-infusion affects the shot, especially the pressure of the main extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I was actually reading an &lt;a href="https://compoundcoffee.com/experiments/13_Pre-infusion-and-its-impact-on-espresso" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on this yesterday. There is no added volume during pre-infusion. All the pre-infusion step does is wet the espresso fully to prevent channeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article I linked actually shows that less extraction happens during pre-infusion. So to answer your question, it does affect the shot, but not the volume.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to get an even drip without Mr. Coffee filtration disks</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to figure out why our coffee has been very weak despite double the amount of grounds used compared to the old coffee maker we had. We received a new coffee maker at Christmas. Both the old and new coffee makers are Mr. coffee brand. The new coffee maker however lasted a couple of months before it started producing really weak coffee. I think I figured out today that the problem is that the filtration disk needs to be replaced every month. The disk we have is the one that came with the coffee maker at Christmas a few months ago. When I look at the grounds, there are primarily two depressions where it looks like most of the water is dripping and those depressions line up with bulges in the filter above, so I think that a disk replacement should produce a more even drip. However, I am not interested in buying disks to replace every month. We already have filtered water in our house. So I’ve been wondering if there is a filtration disk replacement that can be a permanent solution to producing an even drip. Perhaps a metal or plastic piece with holes in it similar to what I see on our old coffee maker where the drips came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried searching for such a product, but could not find one. Does anyone have another solution for this issue? Any tricks?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you do not care about filtering the water, you may cut round pieces from any paper filter and place them on top of the coffee pile in the basket before each brew. This should help to distribute hot water on the coffee pile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, that this may be more expensive than using the regular filter as the cut pieces of water filter could be used once.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>To what temperature do coffee grounds need to be freezed at, after getting wet?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;As per this question &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/4733/can-i-store-wet-coffee-beans-in-fridge?newreg=8de5d3ed2f5445f38bc387fcdb97d649"&gt;Can I store wet coffee beans in fridge?&lt;/a&gt; "From a food safety perspective, three to four days should be fine. For longer periods, simply freeze them"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the link references to beans, I am more interested in coffee grounds, so not sure if it would still be applicable. To what temperature can I freeze them to prevent mold and how much time is the maximum I can store it ?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The standard refrigerator temperature most official websites assume are around 4C. Yes, there are different temperature zones in home refrigerators, but that’s included in the general recommendation of 3-4 days for “prepared foods” category - which wet coffee grounds would fall into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freezer storage below-18 C is “unlimited” from a microbiological perspective - the activity of mold and bacteria is near zero. But over time, the quality of frozen food will suffer. Interestingly, it’s often the fats that still will go rancid, especially if the item isn’t wrapped tightly and oxygen can reach the product. Improper packaging and temperature fluctuations can also create &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezer_burn" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;freezer burn.&lt;/a&gt; As the oils in coffee are an important contributor to flavor, I wouldn’t exceed three months of freezer time, but that’s purely for quality reasons, not due to food safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our sister site &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com"&gt;Seasoned Advice&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/21068/how-long-can-i-store-a-food-in-the-pantry-refrigerator-or-freezer"&gt;generic Q/A on safe storage times&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of additional information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when you make coffee, (ideally) all of the desireable solubles get extracted, what remains are, if done well, most of the undesireable ones and insoluble components. A second round of extraction will not produce anything you'll want to drink, unless you like bitter brown water. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Nitrogen wash beans VS Fresh</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I live in a really small area. The closet roaster to me is roughly an hour drive away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know how big of a role that using fresh beans play in making quality espresso. Because I may not be able to make it to the roaster on a regular basis, I was curious about LaVazza coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard and read online that LaVazza uses a nitrogen wash on all of their beans that keep them fresh longer. How do they perform compared to fresh beans? Obviously they wont be identical, but will they produce a nice fully bodied espresso with a decent amount of crema?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The correct term is &lt;a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/nitrogen-flushing-protects-and-preserves-foods-2505948" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nitrogen flushing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it does appear to increase the stored shelf life of roasted beans.  There is a school of thought that using nitrogen (80% of the air we breath) is not a green friendly technique, but it is nevertheless used in other products too.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee Expired before its mentioned date?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I buy this coffee jar 3 months ago and now coffee is turned into solid round balls is this expired? I can use or not is this good for use?&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bsix6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I am afraid that there are two misconceptions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One, what you have in the jar are not coffee beans, it’s freeze-dried prepared coffee. Think of it as the coffee equivalent of bullion cubes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two, the date on the container is almost certainly not an “expiry date” (Microbes don’t use calendars), but a “best before” date, which is fundamentally different.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some foods have a “use by” date, after which the food is no longer “safe”’by food safety standards. Minced meat (aka hamburger) is a classic example. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instant coffee doesn’t fall into the same category of very easily spoiling food, hence the “best before”, which is a recommendation given by the manufacturer to ensure that the product is in optimal condition. After that, the quality may be somewhat decreased, but the product is usually not “unsafe”. Other examples are pasta (keeps for years if stored properly) or beans (may take longer to soften after some time, but are perfectly fine to use still).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lumps you see in your jar are caused by moisture, which made some of the granules sticky. Maybe you left it open or used a damp spoon to scoop out some instant coffee? Try to break it up gently. If there’s only very little humidity, this should be fairly easy and could already solve the issue. If not, just use the lump(s) as you would the finer granules, they will dissolve in hot water without a problem. I suggest you are a bit more careful about &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/keep_one%27s_powder_dry" rel="noreferrer"&gt;keeping your powder dry&lt;/a&gt; when handling the jar in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What variables influence yield for a stovetop/moka pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I got a moka pot a couple of months ago and have more or less settled on a formula I like, but one thing still really puzzles me. The quantity that ends up in the top chamber has started varying considerably. The pot is supposed to make enough for about two full cups, but sometimes only about half a cup's worth will come out and then it'll make the 'boiling over' sound that usually tells me it's done. If I try to keep it on the heat, it'll just keep furiously boiling and no more coffee will come into the top chamber. When I get a low yield, it'll always be really strong, so I can dilute it afterwards and the result is roughly the same, but it's still annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm finding it very hard to pin down the variables that make it do this. Of course I always fill the bottom chamber the same amount - just below the valve. I have been varying the grind but I will get two wildly different results even between two brews using the exact same grind setting. I have now settled on a medium fine grind. I have switched from cold water to 90°C - but again, when I was trying both of those options out I was getting varying yields for each. The only thing that I don't keep all that precise control over is quantity of beans (I roughly fill to a finger over a certain marker in my grinder) but I don't see how that would influence things that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit I don't understand very well the whole percolation mechanism (in my naive brain, it shouldn't work at all!) so I find it hard to reason through it. Any tips?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. If it makes any difference, the model I'm using is a &lt;a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/p/Stellar-SC63-6-Cup-Espresso-Maker-375ml-Silver/19028174130" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Stellar SC63 6 cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yield and the quality of the brew depends on how water is pushed through the grounds. Some things to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;grind size&lt;/strong&gt;: the finer the grind, the more pressure is needed to push water through. If you need to build more pressure, it may take longer to get to the same yield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;grind consistency&lt;/strong&gt;: this is related to grind size. If you have larger and smaller pieces in your ground coffee, you may get channelling. To get an idea of what happens, the smaller pieces may be lumped together needing relatively much pressure to push water through whereas the water can easily be pushed along the larger pieces. As such, an inconsistent grind can easily lead to an inconsistent brew (including yield).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tamp pressure&lt;/strong&gt;: do you tamp the grind (or do you level it out and push it with your fingers)? The more packed your grounds are, the more pressure is needed to push water through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat&lt;/strong&gt;, how big you set your flame and how far you set your moka pot compared to the flame will influence how pressure builds. A very large flame with the moka pot directly above it will heat quickly and build pressure faster. This might result in a faster brew. You want to watch out though, you might end up heating the upper chamber too much making the first part of your brew burn making the whole thing needlessly bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>How to clean Delonghi Caffe Corso's pre-ground coffee funnel?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I inadvertently put whole beans where ground coffee goes. Will this harm machine’s operation?  How can I easily remove the beans, please? Thank you. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Such automatic machines have a mechanism inside that tamps the pre-ground coffee (put through the funnel) and then pulls an espresso automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot say if it really harms the mechanism, but I'd rather don't continue using the machine before removing the beans from the pre-ground coffee funnel. Very probably, the mechanism cannot adequately temp whole beans and may got scratched, crack, etc. I wouldn't take the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have that exact machine, but after looking at it's photo, by intuition I could say that it should have a door to access the mechanism on the left side. Remove that door and also remove the mechanism*. Simply remove any beans if you could see some and preferably rinse any coffee residue off the mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you should have access from the funnel to the brewing mechanism to move the pre-ground coffee to the tamping area. There should be an upward hole somewhere. Very probably close to the mechanism, so you can see after you remove the mechanism. If it is not there, also remove the drip tray and check if you could find that hole from inside the machine. When found, you should be able to remove the beans from that hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope all goes well and you could continue using the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(*) The mechanism should be modular for cleaning. Most of the time you could remove the whole mechanism by pushing a lever or something similar, then rinse it under tap water.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to train coffee notes tasting for newbie</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So I got few of my friends to join the brotherhood of coffee. And they asked me about the flavor notes that are marked on the beans packages, the ones that provide a few hints about the taste.
Can someone share a method to train the tongue to taste the flavor notes faster?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Sensory skills are one of the most important skills any barista and coffee lover could have. But, just like with any other skill, it takes time to develop. The first and easiest thing you can do is to drink as much coffee as you can and explore the vast world of flavor profiles and complexities of different coffees around the world have to offer. Maybe one day go find a shop selling a Yergacheve or a Genji from Ethiopia and next go find a Sumatra or Papua New Guinea. Recognizing this kind of dichotomy will help you to find major differences in coffee and eventually sharpen your palate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, in fact, a science behind tasting coffee. It's been said in studies that when we taste things we associate them with a color. If you taste butter, you might see yellow. If you taste kale, you might see green, etc. The SCA has a great visual representation of this. You can find it on google or on their website. I would use that as guide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, eat more food and fruits. Get more familiar with food. When you look at the color wheel, you'll probably notice a lot of flavors or fruits that you've never even heard of. Eating more food can help you train your palate for tasting coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there is both a subjective and objective aspect to tasting coffee.  If you were drinking a Kenyan coffee and said, "I taste green apple," then objectively speaking, you're tasting what is known as Malic Acid. If you tasted grape, tartaric acid, and so on. This does not come easily or quickly, but keep with it. Don't, out of potential discouragement, start saying you taste things just to say that you taste them. Allow your brain to adjust and sooner than later you'll be a whole lot better at being able to distinguish flavors in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Using Nescafe Gold on Espresso Maker</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm very new to the land of brewing your own coffee, I just thought of making my own coffee, until now, I have only drank tea and tried the ready made coffee sachets that were available in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this Espresso Maker&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MOLwJ.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MOLwJ.png" alt="**enter image description here**"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I bought this Coffee blend, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QNJB8.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QNJB8.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question would be if I can use this blend with my maker, or do I need something different. and If I need something different, which product would be recommended?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Absolutely not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nescafé is not coffee in the sense of coffee beans, ground, ready for brewing. It’s &lt;em&gt;instant&lt;/em&gt; coffee, which means coffee was brewed and then freeze-dried. The resulting granules can then be put in hot water to create a coffee drink (although some fundamentalist would dispute the claim that the result qualifies as “coffee”, but I digress). Think of it as the coffee-equivalent of a bullion cube. If you put that in your machine, you would - at best - get a weird result and possibly damage it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you need for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Moka&lt;/a&gt; (the kind of stovetop espresso maker you got) are &lt;strong&gt;real coffee beans&lt;/strong&gt;. Either you get whole beans plus a grinder or you buy pre-ground beans. Some will frown upon the latter, but if you are totally new, it should be ok as a start and I recommend it. Read the labels, because ground coffee comes in different grind sizes, but mainstream Italian coffee brands like Lavazza, Illy, Segafredo and the other usual suspects will for example put a little symbol on the packs showing a Moka like yours, indicating a suitable grind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, follow the instructions that (hopefully) came with your coffee maker, e.g. fill the bottom chamber to the fill line (or just under the valve if not line is given), fill the coffee grounds chamber (the funnel-thingy) flush, but don’t compress, remove from the heat when it starts making gargling noises...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nescafé is the same as the one-serving sachets you mentioned before, so if you are ok with that, you can still use it up when you don’t want to pull out the Moka. Although I suspect once you have come to appreciate a good coffee from fresh beans, you won’t want to go back to instant.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's the science behind precision baskets?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of aftermarket filter baskets available that are praised on different forums, including &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/3720/6506"&gt;this site (from Shiri's answer)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;VST baskets are replacement baskets for your portafilter with filter holes positioned and sized to aid uniform extractions. Would recommend getting one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's the reasoning behind these aftermarket baskets? I get that they pay more attention to the size and positioning of the holes, but I'm wondering why that matters so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.perfectdailygrind.com/2016/06/ims-vs-vst-espresso-baskets-effects-extraction/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;perfectdailygrind.com&lt;/a&gt; writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Prior to this, most baskets had serious design flaws. Hole sizes varied wildly – some were big enough to allow particles to pass through into the espresso, while others so small that they were easily blocked, all in the same basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering to what extent that quote is still relevant meaning there's still a basis for aftermarket baskets. Studies or simple tests objectively comparing the operation of stock and precision baskets are appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answers could include citing ideal margins on hole sizes, thus establishing really when a hole is too big or too small for proper extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;So, it's kind of complicated. To understand why the hole area is important, we need to consider how an espresso is made and what it takes to taste good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;When does coffee taste good?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making coffee is the processes of extracting water solvable compounds from the coffee grounds. Some taste good, some don't. The trick is to extract the right amount of each. You can control this by how much and how long the water touches the coffee grounds. Too much water and bitter, nasty compounds are extracted. Too short and only sour and volatile compounds end up in the water. You want the right balance for that delicious espresso you have come to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Setting up the ideal coffee puck&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espresso is about extracting coffee flavors from the small coffee particles. We want to extract each particle exactly as much. To do so, you carefully grind the particles to a certain size. The reason why people buy expensive burr grinders is to make the particle size distribution as narrow as possible (so all coffee grounds have the same size, so water touches the same surface area). You tamp the coffee in the filter basket as level as possible. Ideally, all particles are the same size and the density of coffee is homogeneous in the whole coffee puck (achieved by proper distribution and tamping level). Then water is pressed trough the puck at 9 bars of pressure. Ignoring the filter basket, the flow rate trough the puck will be the same everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;It's about flow rate&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water will take the path of least resistance (lowest density, largest holes). So if you've carefully set up your puck to have a perfect particle distribution and homogeneous density but the holes in your filterbasket vary in size, more water will flow trough the larger holes. More water passes trough that path and the coffee above, therefore extracting those parts of the coffee puck more. This is an uneven extraction and deviates from the ideal where every particle is extracted exactly as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a homogeneous water resistance, we try to give the holes the same surface area. This ensures that if you have the perfect puck, water will flow evenly throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I bought my Strada basket, &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x9T0Q.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;it came with a histogram showing the hole size distribution&lt;/a&gt;, which I think is pretty cool. You can see how narrow that Gaussian is, and it was a noticable improvement from the filter baskets that came with the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Water shooting out of spout in Moka pot</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been watching videos of people preparing coffee in Moka pots on Youtube and one thing I noticed is that most people seem to initially leave the lid open. However, when I tried this the initial volume of water from the spout erupts out in both directions with such ferocity that it actually leaves the pot entirely and drenches the stove on either direction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every video I have seen they seem to have a nice gentle flow that merely dribbles out of the spout and falls down the spout into the chamber. My one is more like a volcano!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried using a lower setting on the hob - there are 6 settings. At the very lowest (#1) it doesn't boil at all. At settings 3-6 I get a huge jet of water as described above. At setting #2 I get a smaller jet of water (that still shoots out of the pot) however on this setting the water seems to stop boiling up from the lower chamber leaving me with half a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realise that I can just do this with the lid down but I'm curious as to why this seems to happen. It's a single cup aluminium Moka pot which hadn't been used regularly for maybe a year until the last few weeks when I have been using it regularly. I took it apart earlier today and gave everything a good scrub. Still no difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried with the coffee chamber, full, half-full and empty (so just boiling water). It doesn't matter - same result with all. I always fill the water up to just below the valve. I have tried with cold water and warm water. Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;How's the grind on your coffee? It should be pretty fine, if not the water will move through the puck very quickly. Have you tried using a little finer coffee? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also recommended method is to use already boiling water, add it to the bottom of the moka pot and use a towel to tighten. This way you don't heat the actual ground coffee and burn it before water even gets up there.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The way I look at it, what you add into coffee doesn't change the "type" of coffee.  The act of adding sugar to something doesn't change the type.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drip coffee refers to coffee made by dripping water over grinds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Espresso is water and pressure and fine grind coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Americano refers to coffee made by adding hot water to an espresso &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cappuccino refers to coffee made by adding steamed milk to an espresso&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding sugar to any of these drinks doesn't change what type of drink it is.  A coffee snob might say that the "traditional" method is have it black, no sweetener but that doesn't make sense.  I get americano's and sometimes get it with milk and sometimes with sweetener.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the easiest way to make coffee from beans at home without a device/machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What would be the easiest way to make coffee at home (from coffee beans, no powders or ready-made products from the shop), without having to buy an espresso machine.
I do not know all the methods, but maybe these are options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moka Coffeemake (non-electrical) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;French press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cezve (turkish coffee)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aeropress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When speaking about easiest, it means there shouldn't be much effort in the process of making the coffee (and probably cleaning afterwards). &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;For a single cup of coffee, an Aeropress is hands-down the easiest manual coffee brewer around, including cleanup afterwards. I use mine every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're wanting to make more than one cup at a time, an appropriate sized moka stove-top would be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>NS Oscar II should I drain the boiler before storage?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I' have a Nuova Simonelli Oscar II machine for events. There is considerable time between those events and I was wondering if I should drain the boiler before storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual storage time is about 6 months or longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or what are the possible issues that may raise from draining / not draining the boiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The Oscar 1 has a brass plug that can be removed with a wrench. You can then pick the machine up and tip it over a drain. Some water might remain in the heat exchanger and tubes, but that will get almost all water out. I don't know whether the boiler design on the Oscar 2 is the same, but it wouldn't be surprising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is any possibility of storage temperatures going below freezing, you must drain it. I would drain the machine regardless. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What to use in place of gooseneck kettle?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;To make pour over coffee can I use a cup to pour the water on the grounds? How can I best approximate the proper water temperature? I do have a kettle to boil the water but a cup gives me more control in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are two important factors here: &lt;strong&gt;temperature&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;control&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Temperature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperature is probably the most important factor here. You don't want the temperature to be too low, when that's the case you won't be able to extract all that you want. You can easily ensure you're not using water that's too cold, either by pouring straight from the kettle (goose-neck or otherwise) or by preheating the pouring vessel (e.g. your pouring cup).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control is important for pour over brews, but it's not absolutely necessary. You can simply use a regular kettle to pour but you'll have less control over the flow rate (how fast water flows out) and where you irrigate the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's definitely possible to use a (pouring) cup instead of a goose-neck kettle, just make sure it's pre-heated.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How many scoops of non-espresso coffee beans should I grind for 1 AeroPress cup?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I buy strength "3" coffee beans and measure out 1 scoop into my hand grinder. I then fill the chamber to the top (inverted) and let it brew for up to about a minute. However, I've always wondered if I've been using enough coffee beans as the cup always appears a little watered down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen plenty of videos and blog posts about how to make an Americano with espresso beans, but i've not found much in terms of making a cup of coffee with non-espresso beans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have mine black, no sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone confirm what is considered standard practice for the number of scoops of beans for a normal cup of coffee (non americano, non-espresso beans)?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Can anyone confirm what is considered standard practice for the number of scoops of beans for a normal cup of coffee (non americano, non-espresso beans)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The are both ill-defined terms. A better measure is brew ratio, which describes the water to coffee ratio in mass units. On &lt;a href="https://handground.com/grind/66-recipes-for-amazing-aeropress-coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;handground.com&lt;/a&gt;, there are a lot of recipes for AeroPress with brew ratios ranging from 17:1 at the weakest up to 8:1 at the strongest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd suggest starting somewhere in the middle and adjusting based on the results. Since you're already getting a weak cup, the next step should have a slightly lower brew ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can either switch to mass units (grams or Imperial units with a simple kitchen scale work fine). The benefits of weight units are twofold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're more precise. Most kitchen scales are accurate to the gram or even a tenth of a gram. With scoops, you may need to use something like &lt;em&gt;a little bit less than a full scoop&lt;/em&gt; and you'll have difficulty reproducing that exactly, even more so when you want to adjust a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The units translate to different coffees as well. Suppose you have a coffee with a different roast level, then its density may also vary. As such, a volumetric scoop of one coffee contain more or less coffee than a different variety of coffee. This is more of a factor when working with whole beans, but if you buy pre-ground the grind size will also have an impact when using volumetric scoops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I'd suggest switching to mass units and keeping track of adjustments and taste. If you don't like to get into the whole ratio thing, you can just fix the water content and increase the amount of coffee to get a stronger cup. The only time when you need to change the amount of water is when you want to adjust how much liquid you get in your final cup.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Which is better for grinding coffee: Food processor or blender?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Which is better for grinding coffee for use in a drip coffee maker: Food processor or blender?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Update: I noticed that my food processor makes evenly-sized course grounds, and my blender grinds smaller, but unevenly: fine, packed dust and medium-course grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion from my experimentation: A blender is overall better.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I guess both food processors and blenders would act like big blade grinders. Blade grinders give particles of a wide range of sizes, from fine dust to chunks.  This gives uneven flavor extraction (if you can taste it), and requires the use of the finest filter.  If I had to choose, a small food processor might be superior, since the blades on blenders are pitched to stir more than to cut.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lacking a burr grinder, which gives more consistent particle size and therefore predictable extraction, I'd repurpose an old pepper grinder!  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is the recall of Solimo coffee capsules a serious issue?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;We have a Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffee machine and we usually buy Solimo branded capsules to it.
This week I got an email from the shop, saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Solimo Dolce Gusto* compatible Cafè Au Lait pods- UTZ certified- 96
  pods (6 x 16)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The product you purchased is affected because it may contain plastic
  fragments from the pod. If you still have this product, please throw
  it away immediately and do not use it. There is no need for you to
  return any product to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contacted customer service, but they weren't really aware of this issue but tried to convince me this is not serious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to search for an incident report or any news why this was called back and how many products were affected, but couldn't find anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know how did they find out this product defect and what are the health risks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is as described then it sounds benign from a health perspective and the notice is the company covering itself from legal action.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This looks like oxidation, try cleaning it with hot water (NO soap). After most of it has gone, fill up with hot water again and add a few spoons of bicarbonate. Stir and let it sit for a day or 2. After that, rinse and inspect. If the oxidation has gone too deep, the pot will need sanding and polishing, which will weaken the pot. In that case it would be better to ditch it and get a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How come some beans seem to want longer ratios?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if it's my grinder or my machine or what, but I find I can't a get a ratio of less than about 3:1 - any shorter and the shot comes out sour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory I can grind finer, but the pour is slow even at the current grind level. If I go any finer, the coffee comes out in drips (even if I reduce the amount in the pf).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could this be to do with the beans? I have been using fairly dark roasts, but not super dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also wondering if this is affected by temperature - other things being equal, higher temp = more complete extraction?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the process for roasting and preparing chicory for coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that Community Coffee is essentially the standard for chicory coffee, both blended and just straight brewed chicory.  What are the recipes, steps and ratios for roasting, preparing and brewing chicory brew, and for brewing blended chicory and coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.homegrounds.co/chicory-coffee/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; in @InstantCoffeeJedi's comment points out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mince the roots into equal particles with a knife. The roots are sturdy, so you’ll need a sharp knife, especially since the pieces shouldn’t be longer than 1 inch. If you don’t cut them in the same size, there’s a chance that they will not roast evenly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roast the chicory pieces. Arrange them on a shallow baking pan or a baking sheet and place them into the oven. Toast them at 350 degrees until their color changes to golden brown. If you can sense a coffee-like smell, this means they are finished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grind the roots. Place the roasted chicory roots into your burr grinder and grind them with the same coarseness as you grind your coffee beans. Ideally, it should be a fine grind if you’ll brew them in an espresso machine or a coarser grind if you have a French press, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix chicory with ground coffee. The ratio is up to you. If you want the taste of coffee without the caffeine stimulation, you can try with a 4:1 ratio of chicory to coffee. Sometimes a 2:3 chicory-to-coffee blend of is good if you want to gradually reduce your caffeine intake. If you want to spread out your coffee supply over a longer period, adding four-fifths of chicory would be enough. Alternatively, you don’t have to add coffee at all for a true chicory coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grind the roots. Place the roasted chicory roots into your burr grinder and grind them wit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brew your coffee. Use the chicory and coffee powder mix to make the coffee as you regularly would. All the other factors such as time or technique should be the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add some foamed milk, toppings, or flavorings to enhance the aroma and serve your chicory root coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically you roast the chicory in the oven at 350°F (or 177°C) until they turn brown and after cooling them you mix 20-40% of their grounds with coffee grounds. Mixing chicory in doesn't really yield gourmet coffee so imprecise recipes are to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How many grams of coffee to use with the George Howell Kalita Wave recipe?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Ever since reading &lt;a href="https://prima-coffee.com/learn/article/brewing-guides/comparing-kalita-wave-recipes/33005" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this article from Prima Coffee&lt;/a&gt; comparing Kalita Wave recipes, I've been using the &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eftby.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;George Howell&lt;/a&gt; method. This recipe calls for 25-28g of coffee for 390g of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this to be fairly strong and I wonder why the recipe calls for this large amount of coffee. In the past I had done ~18g of coffee for my pour overs and thought it brewed a decent cup. I understand I'm free to change the amount per my own tastes/roast, but I want to know if there's specific reason why 25/390g seems to be the chosen ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The given ratio is maybe a bit unusual - many sources for pour-over irrespective of the exact brand (Chemex, Hario,...) give &lt;a href="https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/blog/how-to-perfect-pour-over" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1:17&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theworktop.com/breakfast-brunch-recipes/how-to-make-pour-over-coffee/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;60g per liter of water&lt;/a&gt;, which is 16.666. This seems to be the ballpark number for pour-over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is the Kalita different?&lt;br&gt;
Your source calculates between 1:13.9 to 1:15.6. Interestingly, at least one &lt;a href="https://www.barista-passione.de/kalita-wave-dripper/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; (in German, sorry) agrees with the ratio of 1:15.4 for the Kalita, yet &lt;a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6x6YdlAmWLA" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; goes as low as 17.8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conclusion, sort of:&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The ratio is opinion-based and a matter of taste.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it’s up to you to go significantly lower - you won’t be breaking any laws - and I will freely admit that I am a total whimp when it comes to coffee strength. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's the difference between Turkish and Italian coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is there any difference between Turkish coffee and Italian coffee? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you mean the products you see at a grocer, the answer is simply grind. "Turkish coffee" is a finer grind setting than espresso, so that the final product very closely resembles dust. "Italian coffee" is likely either espresso ground to be used with an espresso machine or literally "imported from Italy".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish coffee is for use with a special, Turkish brewing process. The coffee dust is mixed with water in a special pot called a cezve or an ibrik. The solution is brought to a boil. Then the coffee is scooped or poured from the pot. Turkish coffee is drunk unfiltered, so you drink the actual coffee like you would with cocoa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espresso is brewed by forcing water through coffee grounds at pressure. The pressure extracts oils and compounds from the coffee to create the famous Italian coffee called espresso. The grounds have to be relatively course compared to Turkish to support this process; too fine grinds in an espresso machine would clog the machine. Espresso is partially filtered, meaning you don't drink most of the actual coffee grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Piece that goes screwed in my steam wand</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I bought a espresso machine for home. The machine I bought is a Ikohs Kaffeta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a screwable piece that goes in the tip of the steam wand that it is used to create foam (as the manual says).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see some other home espresso machines come with what it's called an auto-frothing wand, and basically is a piece that you can remove to make the wand work like a normal wand for creating more micro foam milk.
I tried removing that piece but it only heats the liquid and creates a lot of bubbles.
I can only put air into the milk and make a whirl using that piece. The thing is that I am tring to create more of a microfoam for trying latte art but I end up getting a thick layer of dense foam (which I also like) but I want to be able to create micro-foamy milk.
I get nothing like elastic milk.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Is it a wand with a single tip at the end?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get microfoam, you only have to produce a little foam at the start of steaming, a few light 'rips' of bubbles, then the rest of the time is spent whirling this into the milk. Keep the wand tip just below the milk and a little to the side while keeping the pitcher flat. This will create a whirlpool that helps mix everything else up. Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee choices for Zombie Apocalypse</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;(This is probably an opinion question.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the coronavirus I've been stocking up on foods that last, and that I like to eat.  Example, I love figs and dried fruit and eat them daily so I've bought three months worth.  I don't like canned sardines so I didn't stock up on that as I would never eat them unless I was under duress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the thought went to coffee. I buy my coffee from a local roaster with a store a few blocks from where I live. As a result I don't buy a lot of coffee at one time. In my experience coffee beans are at their best for about two weeks after roasting and start losing their flavor after about a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - and this is an opinion question: How best to provide for a three to six month shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy beans and have them get stale OR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy packaged coffee: Cafe Bustello or illy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I know. People are dying and hurting and I'm concerned about sitting around in my apartment without any coffee. Chances are this will not be the Zombie Apocalypse; nor will it be a major pandemic outside of China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the question remains - how best to stock up for 3-6 months AND not "waste" ones money buying things that one would not use under normal conditions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL/DR - After 6 months storage which would be superior - buying cans of illy or freshly roasted beans stored in a bail lid jars?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Freshly roasted beans start degrading after a week or so. Maybe buying cans of beans - ground or not - would be your best choice for drinking not so great coffee during the end days. Check that they "vacuum pack". Maybe that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would make another choice: properly stored &lt;strong&gt;green&lt;/strong&gt; coffee beans can last for year. Then I would roast it (your going to have filled propane tanks, right?). You can roast a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of coffee from one 5 gal propane tank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is my selected choice and I am prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to use a coffee machine water tank for a different project. The problem is, I am unable to find a water spout for the tank because of which I cannot pump the water out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this work in a coffee machine? What kind of a part is it? and how do i find it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to put this question in a better way, How does the water tank couple to the pump and how do I find that part?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: You can use this tank as a reference
&lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B0166HQBTE" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/DeLonghi-7313228241-Delonghi-WATER-TANK/dp/B0166HQBTE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT2: So the product that I am looking for is basically a Valve lifter. But I cannot seem to find these for the water tanks I want to use. Is the mechanisme different for bigger machines?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Minimum amount of water in coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a sunbeam coffee maker. The lowest line for heating water is at 4 cups. However, I rarely drink 4 cups at home. Can I heat, say 2 cups for instance?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes, you should be able to make only the amount you need - the markings on the glass carafe are only for water measurement - there's no &amp;quot;minimum&amp;quot; water amount! Carefully measure out 2 cups of water (I use a pyrex measuring cup) and add the appropriate amount of grounds (however strong/weak you like your coffee) and you should have 2 fresh cups of coffee within minutes. In the hotter months, I usually make more than I need and put the remainder into a container in the fridge for iced coffee later :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Help me determine the strength of my coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I drink coffee from a Nespresso Machine (Nespresso Pixie).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use one capsule of Ristretto Italiano (black), but run it twice under the 'Lungo' option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus my question is: 
What is the strength of the cup I am getting (it'll be weaker than an espresso)? And what other brewing method can give me the same result? Moka pot? Drip coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The Lungo option is a weaker setting and is still meant to be run ONCE. You run the Lungo option and use a coffee cup slightly larger than the Expresso cup. Nespresso is NOT meant to make a regular cup of coffee ever. It makes Expresso (40ml or 1.4 fluid ounces ounces) or Lungo (110ml or 3.7 fluid ounces). Also not all capsules can be used for Lungo since some are meant for weak Expressos. Get yourself a Coffee Press for regular coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Option is make a Lungo and use Expresso to control strength of coffee. So one Lungo and 1 Express will make a medium strength small cup of coffee. Also certain brands like Bustelo capsules make very strong Expresso and Nice Lungo.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Drip Coffee Maker. Slow and then extremely fast</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Let me preface by saying I clean my machine every day. I only use filtered water.
Machine: Morphy Richards Fresco (Standard drip-coffee)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use coffee grounds (medium roast). I don't know the grind. I buy the grounds from a local coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I make four cups (max capacity). basically filling the grind in the metal filer to &amp;quot;4-cups&amp;quot; mark (max).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, 3/4 of the way: The coffee pours at a reasonable rate till it becomes extremely slow. Only drops are coming out. Then finally like a pressure cooker, the coffee pours out a rapid rate. It has a sort-of burned smell to it. The coffee still tastes good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same does not happen when I fill the filter for 3 cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the 3-cup brew slightly less bitter, it has greater natural sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can not tell why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: I found that this was much more prominent in my coffee which had chicory.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Not sure if you'll be able to get a definitive answer on this one, but to me it sounds like filter/coffee choking, and then somehow un-choking. This is something I've experienced with pour-over brews. I've used my Fellow Stagg [X] Dripper before, and at 15g of coffee it's perfect, however at 24g the weight of the coffee is too great and it presses the filter and coffee directly against the holes on the bottom of the dripper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the process I'll give the coffee a few stirs with a stir-stick, and it will immediately start flowing faster. It makes sense that you'd get a sweeter more balanced cup when the coffee doesn't choke. To me it also makes sense that you have a greater chance of it choking with more beans. Not sure how it could un-choke by itself, one theory is that once enough water pressure is present it creates a low-resistance channel where water flows through very quickly (and this water doesn't extract much coffee, rather would mostly dilute in this case).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Aeropress: does filling it full with water increase the caffeine content of my cup?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;How does the amount of water I pour into an Aeroporess impact the caffeine content of my cup of coffee? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w7MIk.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w7MIk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I make two cups, for cup A I use just enough water so that the 1 is covered on the Aeropress, and for cup B  I use enough water so that the whole tube is filled, then what will be the ratio of caffeine in the two cups? Of course, I assume that the same amount of coffee is used for both cups. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I assume that the same amount of coffee is used for both cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;No&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caffeine dissolves very readily in water. The caffeine content in your cup is mainly and almost solely determined by the amount of coffee you use. The impact of any other factors such as amount of water, water temperature, and pressure are negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a rough estimate of the amount of caffeine in your cup do this: multiply the amount of coffee in grams by 10, that's roughly the amount of caffeine in milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Do you re-heat the kettle between pours?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When making pourover coffee (e.g. V60), do you re-heat the kettle between pours in order to have a more constant temperature? For example, if you started blooming at 98 °C, and you wait 45 seconds, the temperature may already be one or two degrees less. So does it affect the taste in the positive way if you re-heat the kettle between pours, so you try to make every pour at same (or close) temperature?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Short answer: &lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reheating your kettle between pours you introduce another variable which can mess with the consistency of your brew. The reason we measure everything when brewing coffee is to be able to isolate a single variable, adjust it, and determine its impact on the taste of the brew. Consistency is the most important thing here.
Losing one or two degrees in your kettle while brewing shouldn't have much of an impact on the taste of your brew if it happens consistently. Also, the water drops in temperature significantly when it reaches the grounds, as explained in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_r5kpXPRYo" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;James's video&lt;/a&gt; you probably meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both James Hoffmann and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B02U5ZqJhM" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Matt Perger&lt;/a&gt; recommend using boiling water for brewing because seeing water bubble (and therefore knowing it's exactly 100°C) is more reliable than having a thermometer telling you the temperature. &amp;quot;25 degree water looks exactly the same as 85 degree water&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My recommendation is to let the water come to a boil and as soon as it starts boiling, start your brew and don't reheat it between pours. Even though the water might cool down a little, it will do so similarly from brew to brew. If you reheat your kettle between pours, you'll have to put in on the stove the exact same way each time, which is difficult (maybe not difficult but surely finicky) to achieve, especially if you have a pour-over to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before anyone comments with &amp;quot;100°C is too hot, you'll burn the coffee&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee is roasted at temperatures around and above 200°C, you're not burning anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It will taste burnt and bitter because the bitter compounds will be extracted more easily.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, over-extraction is your problem which can easily be solved by adjusting your grind size.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's the rationale behind this placement of the pressure gauge?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently got an E61 single-boiler machine (ECM Classika PID) and am trying to understand how it all works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't been able to deduce any reason for how/where the pressure gauge is connected. It's at the end of a long, coiled capillary tube that connects just downstream of the pump:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bDyu7.png" width="400" alt="plumbing diagram of ECM Classika"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any particular reason for the pressure gauge to be connected here, as opposed to e.g. downstream of the boiler?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's likely connected there to ensure only cold water goes to the gauge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, hot water would negatively affect the gauge and, in a capillary tube, more rapidly deposit minerals and clog.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is an inflated bag of coffee a problem?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;If an unopened bag of ground coffee is very inflated, does it indicate a problem with the coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If the coffee is, (ground or not) sealed directly after roasting, the coffee will still gas out, releasing CO2 as a result from the roasting process wich leads to inflated bags. On many coffee bags, especially from "smaller" roasters there is a little valve integrated to let this excess CO2 escape rahter than blow up the bag.
This happens for up to two weeks after roasting, the most of it shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is rather a sign of freshness, but that depends on where you got your coffee so I can only speculate if it is fresh and that that is the cause ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You probably have a broken shower (dispersion disc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try removing the shower screen - the metal part that faces the coffee. There's a screw in the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above the screen is a plastic dispersion disc (shower); it's job is to spread the water across the bed of coffee. Remove it as well - should pry right out, no additional screws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty common for this disc to break - it's made of plastic and is subject to a lot of heat and pressure. Breville sells replacements on their website, you might also get one at ereplacementparts.com [I have no connection to them but I have purchased this part from them].&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to choose coffee that's the most stimulating without the anxiety</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've never been able to figure out all the patterns to be able to understand which coffee gives me more of the positive effects - mental and physical energy, good mood; with less of the negative effects - anxiety, shakes, tiredness, angriness. So I'm looking for advice on what are likely to be the main factors and how I can make the best &lt;strong&gt;feeling&lt;/strong&gt; cup of coffee at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally a great expensive coffee from a good coffee shop makes me feel good. I generally have a flat white with a little sugar. At the other end of the scale cheap coffee from the supermarket prepared strong in a mocha and drunk straight up can make me feel terrible - easy to anger, anxious, shaky. Starbucks coffee makes me feel physically terrible, and I haven't drunk it for ages. The last time I did I had to sit down as I was nauseus and overcome with tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never found anything that lets me make a great feeling cup of coffee at home. My best feeling cup at the moment is espresso from a mocha, long, with cream and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like at different times the main factors have been:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The coffee bean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The roast (dark roast = more anxious)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How it's prepared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How I consume it (with/without milk, long/short, with/without sugar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freshness of bean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freshness of the coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course I can't rule out my personal mental and physical health at the time, although caffeine does affect me quite strongly so I tend not to drink it when I'm already feeling anxious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are the main factors in how a cup of coffee feels? Is it just personal or is there a way I can optimise for the positive effects? I'm prepared to spend a bit more on the coffee if it feels good. I have various mochas to make espresso, drippers and French press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;Which will take effect quicker? Drinking a cup of instant coffee or eating raw powdered coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you want the effects of the caffeine to be felt the most quickly, you probably should buy caffeine powder or pills, be careful though that you could easily overdose yourself to death with the caffeine powder or if you took more pills than recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, if you don't want to buy the isolated caffeine, drinking it would probably be quicker, since otherwise you'd lose the effect of the absorption by the mouth (which is faster because it goes straight into the bloodstream), and you'd still have to digest the powder to get to the caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Safe or not, I think it comes with the territory.  I've had mine (2 actually) for 5+ years now and it is quite pitted, itself.  I think this is naturally what happens when (mineral) water boils against metals.  I don't know how relevant it is, but I tend to get right to enjoying my coffee, and neglect the moka. Coffee (acidic) seeps down into the reservoir, and I suspect that might contribute to the pitting.  I have no doubt that I've drunk this metal, but thankfully being a food product it is a safe metal; they don't make these things out of lead, you know.  I'm no chemist, biologist or doctor, but I have had a fair amount of experience with a couple of mokas and friends who also use them, and they all inevitably pit.  I don't know if it's safe, but it seems to be the norm, and I have yet to hear of any recalls. Bialetti is a reputable company. And the FDA (or whoever) wouldnt approve a food product that was dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>how often should I replace the metal filter on a Bialetti Moka Express 6-cup?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been using the same filter in my Moka pot for one year, and it looks fine. None of the holes are blocked. But I noticed that Bialetti sells gasket packs in threes with one filter included. That suggests that Bialetti expects (or wants?) you to replace the filter with every third gasket. Seems like overkill to me, but what do the experts say?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to CoffeeSE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need to replace the filter that often, it is just metal  after all. As long as you can clean it properly and it functions normally there is no need to replace it just because you're replacing the gasket, especially when there's no visible corrosion or damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some people who use their Moka Pot very often, don't clean it properly and almost neglect it. They can go through gaskets fairly quickly, my mother used to change it every few months, but she just replaced the filter just once, and that was because she lost the original one. For those people getting &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B000RY7OI0" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a few gaskets for a cheaper price per gasket&lt;/a&gt; makes sense. For others, getting &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B002BLASH6" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;just one&lt;/a&gt; is fine. I have even seen a pack of 6 gaskets and one filter not long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean your Moka Pot after every use (or at least rinse it thoroughly and clean it properly every few days) and you filter should last you quite a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why do we wait four minutes before pressing down the French press?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;It is said to wait sometime before pressing down the French press, what exactly is the driving idea behind waiting before pressing down the piston?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The process of brewing coffee is chemically speaking an extraction - flavor compounds, caffeine etc. migrate into the hot water (compare to steeping tea). The speed of that process is determined by various factors, temperature and surface/contact area amongst them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For French press, you use a comparatively coarse grind which translates to less surface area than pour over (finer grind) or espresso (really fine). So you have to give the water-coffee mix more time for a good extraction. The customary time, which on average should give the desired results, is four minutes, but you are of course free to experiment with other timings, especially if you are also playing around with grind size.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why is coffee sometimes nitrated but never carbonated?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've seen a lot of cold &amp;quot;draft&amp;quot; coffee appearing that is infused or pressurized with nitrogen gas (as with Guinness beer).  The added nitrogen leads to a &amp;quot;smooth, creamy&amp;quot; mouthfeel.  (Although it seems to dissipate very quickly – over a matter of minutes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never seen carbonated draft or bottled coffee – i.e., coffee infused or pressurized with carbon dioxide.  Dissolved carbon dioxide occurs naturally in sparkling spring water and fermentation, and is the gas added to most &amp;quot;sparkling&amp;quot; beverages.  Is there a reason cold &amp;quot;sparkling coffee&amp;quot; is not an item?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide when mixed with water renders the water slightly acidic and changes the flavor of the beverage. It may also react with molecules in the coffee. Nitrogen is inert and will neither lower the pH of the coffee or the topping nor react with the coffee's compounds in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>It is possible to completely dissolve coffee grounds while cleaning a metal filter?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;After months of use, the metal filter used in my French press coffeemaker now has small traces of coffee grounds stuck between the mesh fibers which cannot be removed by brushing either side. Seeing the advice in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3886/how-do-i-effectively-clean-a-metal-chemex-filter"&gt;How do I effectively clean a metal Chemex filter?&lt;/a&gt;, soaked the filter in 5% vinegar for multiple nights, but unfortunately the grounds remained embedded in the mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before trying alternative methods in the linked post, I wanted to check with folks here to see if any were particularly effective, especially before applying any of them method to clean a metal, cylindrical cold brew filter, which would be more difficult to replace if damaged than the metal mesh of a French press:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soak filter in vinegar (acetic acid) solution
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The recommendation seems to use a solution of 1 part vinegar, 1 part water. Any drawbacks to using pure vinegar (which itself has low acidity, 5% in my case)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soak filter in lemon juice (citric acid) solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soak in bleach
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any concerns about damaging filter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soak filter in baking soda
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any advantage to combining baking soda with vinegar for the soaking solution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boil filter in water
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For cleaning a cold brew metal filter which is not designed to withstand temperatures that high, any concerns about the metal deforming or joints coming loose?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boil filter in vinegar
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would that not be damaging to the metal filter, per &lt;a href="https://www.networx.com/article/the-science-of-vinegar" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.networx.com/article/the-science-of-vinegar&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never boil vinegar or even heat it up. At high temperatures, concentrated acetic acid will become corrosive and can burn through metal and rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boil filter in water with teaspoon of Urnex coffee equipment cleaning powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Massage soap through filter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an ultrasonic cleaner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a high-pressure water stream, such as from a Waterpik, to force the coffee grounds out of filter holes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm not a chemist, but I'm confident that you won't be able to dissolve coffee dust using conventional cleaning methods. I think the chemical solutions you describe are primarily aimed at dissolving oily residue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If fine grounds are stuck in the filter, I'd try to remove them mechanically. In this case, I think air pressure from a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressor" rel="noreferrer"&gt;compressor&lt;/a&gt; could push them out.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Bean to Cup cappuccino coffee is never hot enough</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have had several fully automatic bean to cup machines (i.e. which include milk frothing), from expensive Jura machines to Delonghi and many others.  One issue I find with most machines (I sent several Jura's back for this reason) is that the cappuccino they make comes out lukewarm.  I pre-heat my cups with boiling water and yet it still feels a lot cooler than coffee made by a manual machine in a coffee shop.  Can anyone suggest a bean to cup machine that makes a reasonable hot cappuccino?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Many of these fully automatic machines heat the milk by combining steam and milk. In my experience, those machines do not take into account the temperature of the milk, they simply mix steam and milk at a fixed ratio. Assuming the steam has a fairly constant temperature, the temperature of the heated milk will mostly depend on the temperature of the cold milk. Simply stated, cooler milk will produce cooler heated milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use milk straight from the fridge, it might be wise to heat it a bit yourself before passing it through the machine. Microwaving the milk you need to slightly below room temperature and then feeding it through the machine's frothing process should increase the temperature of the heated milk. By extension, the temperature of the final drink will be higher as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful not to pre-heat the milk too much, then the machine could heat it so that you get unwanted chemical reactions (e.g. &lt;a href="https://perfectdailygrind.com/2019/02/what-temperature-should-your-cappuccino-milk-be/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;lactose reacting with proteins&lt;/a&gt;) or that the final product comes out steaming.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What type of coffee maker is this?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I got a stove top coffee maker, from my grandfather (not antique, he bought it recently). I am not sure what type it is. I claims to be a percolator, but functions more like a moka pot. They have given the nozzle to pour, in the top chamber. It heats water in bottom chamber, and the water passes through coffee powder, placed in between, and a brown liquid falls in the top, which is what I drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an Amazon.in link to that piece:
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.in/Pigeon-Xpresso-Stainless-Coffee-Perculator/dp/B072F17LRP/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.amazon.in/Pigeon-Xpresso-Stainless-Coffee-Perculator/dp/B072F17LRP/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Issues with grinding my own beans</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I currently use a Delinghi Espresso machine and have always bought ready ground coffee because the cost of a decent grinder is quite high.
However for Christmas this year, quite a few people bought me coffee beans so I decided to buy myself (what I thought to be) a good budget grinder - Melitta Molino (Melitta seem to have a good name when it comes to coffee particularly when talking about filter coffee)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is... I have been using the Lavazza Espresso beans and generally grind about 10 cups worth at a time.
I notice that on the day of grinding the water basically runs straight through, there is next to no, dark syrup colour, it tends to start mid brown and within seconds looks clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the next day, however, I get a great coffee, nice dark syrup to begin which gets gradually lighter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used other beans which are generally darker, the lavazza Espresso beans are quite light in colour, I have not noticed this issue with other beans but I'm not sure if that is simply because they are more intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should coffee brew better a day after grinding? does it let the ground beans dry out or something?
Or is it something that might be specific to these particular beans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or might there be something else that is causing the issue?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Reviews of the Melitta Molino indicate that the unit is not actually capable of achieving the very fine grind needed for espresso. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Espresso grinders require very tight tolerances in manufacturing to enable the close proximity of burrs required for very fine grinding. This is why the vast majority of grinders made by reputable companies and advertised as &amp;quot;for espresso&amp;quot; tend to start in the several hundreds of dollars range. There's unfortunately no way to shortcut this requirement; loose tolerances would result in too many units being returned when burrs lock up from touching or people complaining that the grind isn't consistent enough. You might sometimes get decent results from cheap grinders, but cheaper grinders will lack consistency and may not be able to achieve very fine grinds at all with some beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the cheapest grinder I would recommend for espresso is the &lt;a href="https://www.eureka.co.it/en/catalogo/prodotti/macinacaff%C3%A8+on+demand/1/25.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Eureka Mignon Filtro&lt;/a&gt;, which is generally priced in the US at $210. Also, the vast majority of grinders that grind well for espresso cannot grind well at coarser grind settings, so you'll likely want a separate grinder if you use other brew methods. Your Melitta should be ok for Aeropress, drip, and maybe French Press (not sure at that level of coarseness), so it's not a waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding coffee tasting better a day after grinding, this might have to do with the coffee itself. Roasted coffee retains some natural gasses that are created when the coffee is roasted. These gasses slowly seep out as the coffee &amp;quot;rests&amp;quot; after roasting. When coffee is left as whole bean, this process can take quite a long time due to the small surface area of exposed bean. After grinding, the process is expedited a lot as a result of (much) more bean surface area being exposed. If you're sensitive to the flavors of these gasses or if you're buying freshly roasted coffee, this degassing process might explain the flavor difference. This would also explain why water seems to run right through the beans on the first day but not on the second: the gasses are highly soluble in water. The &amp;quot;fast flow&amp;quot; problem is frequently observed among coffee roasters when the coffee is too fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>COVID-19 screening test using coffee beans</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Loss of taste or smell is one of the strongest signals for COVID-19. Though not every COVID-19 case has this symptom, it's a very specific symptom that doesn't commonly have other causes. This question is about the suitability of coffee beans as a low cost testing tool for COVID-19. I'm interested in exploring this as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brunobowden/status/1343934162223284226?s=20" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;I lead development&lt;/a&gt; of the WHO COVID-19 app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Odds Ratio&lt;/a&gt; for a person reporting loss of taste or smell was reported as 6.7 through the COVID Symptom Study in their Nature research paper: &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0916-2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Real-time tracking of self-reported symptoms to predict potential COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. Overall AUC reported as 0.75 for all user symptoms. It's &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32317-5/fulltext#%20" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;not accurate enough&lt;/a&gt; to be a diagnosis but it can be combined with other symptoms, cough recording and COVID exposure information to improve accuracy to do screening for further tests. The question is whether adding a specific daily smell test using coffee beans would be worthwhile?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general thought is to have a cup of coffee beans that you smell on a daily basis. Then report in the app if you had a loss of smell. The ideal test is fast, cheap and easy. To be fast, the container may need to be open so you don't have the daily irritation of having to remove a sealed lid. I considered a coffee bean as I thought they'd be cheap and available around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'll excuse multiple questions, I have some specific areas I was looking for feedback on....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to get consistency in smell? Smell decay curve for coffee beans. How quickly does open coffee beans lose their smell? How does an open / closed container impact this? How often might you need to replace the beans due to smell decay, mold or other reasons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost of coffee beans. How widely available and affordable are they in some of the poorest communities in the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any other product that you think that could be more effective. It needs to be an existing widely available low cost product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please share any other thoughts or feedback you might have.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Fresh coffee is neither widely available nor inexpensive in all places. Coffee in Japan is relatively expensive because demand is relatively (extremely) low compared to western nations. I think I remember my coworkers also telling me that fresh coffee in India is almost never used because most Indians so drink coffee prefer instant. I wouldn't trust availability of coffee for this kind of test, but it also can't hurt to include it in the app as an option for people who can get fresh coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say fresh coffee because instant coffee in my experience doesn't have a strong smell in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About smell decay, that depends on a wide range of factors such as time since roasting at time of sale, quality of beans, conditions of storage, and qualities of packaging. My experience with cheap coffees is that they tend to be sold preground (which will lose scents faster than whole bean), though this will not be true in all countries or even all regions within a country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it even matter though? My interpretation of the &amp;quot;loss of smell&amp;quot; symptom of COVID, having not experienced it myself, is literally a complete loss of smell. It would be far more reliable to advise acquiring a new bag of coffee and seeing if you can smell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, there are loads of more economical options. Basically every spice under the sun (onion powder, garlic powder, curry powder, chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, thyme, rosemary, etc.), aromatic vegetables like onions and garlic, vinegar, fish or fish oil, and other aromatic foods might be more widely available at lower prices than coffee in most places.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What benefits does a Moccamaster offer compared to a generic coffee maker?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am currently using a moka pot and a Hario hand grinder to make my morning brew. I try to buy freshly roasted ground beans but sometimes I still end up buying some bags from the supermarket. I drink about 2-3 cups of coffee a day at most, my partner drinks probably 5-6 but some of that is instant coffee. I truly hate the flavour of instant coffee but using the moka pot multiple times a day is hassle so I end up drinking some instant during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of upgrading to a coffee machine and an electric burr grinder. I'd like to buy something like a Moccamaster which could brew a few cups of coffee at a time, which we could drink throughout the day. I was just wondering if anyone who has ever used it would recommend it for a non-expert coffee drinker or should I just stick to a manual pot? Is the difference noticeable between a Moccamaster and a generic cheap coffee maker and does it truly last longer?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A Moccamaster is like any other electric drip brewer. It takes water and ground coffee and it brews a pot of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the difference noticeable between a Moccamaster and a generic cheap coffee maker and does it truly last longer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I've read online, the Moccamaster is a decent brewer. As far as electric brewers go, I think that mostly refers to consistency. All the machine does is adding hot water to the grounds, so consistency means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The water is added to the grounds at the same temperature regardless of the temperature of the cold water you're adding in the reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The water is dispersed somewhat equally over the coffee in the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the good reviews (and no personal experience) I'm sure that it will do the job as good as any other generic brewer. As for build quality, I think it's a decent design (premium materials even compared to the mostly plastic machines in lower price segments) that won't disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at current retail prices though (about €200 in Europe or $300+ in the US), I can't help but mention that it's a steep price for adding hot water to grounds consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there other machines which do a comparable job at a lower price? Definitely. The easiest way to find such a machine at a lower price is to look at a price comparison website for your own locale that includes customer reviews. Simply look for for drip brewers between $/€40-120 and sort them by rating. Then, to make sure that there are no hidden flaws (poor build quality, inconsistent brewing) you search for reviews of the candidate machine(s) online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I mention looking in your own locale is that some machines are priced reasonably well in one locale, but they're more expensive in another. I think the Moccamaster is a good example of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I've seen some genuine recommendations for Moccamasters as well though in a slightly different context. The Moccamaster has been around since the sixties and it's produced by a Dutch company. As such, there are a lot of used machines out there and I've seen people recommend those &lt;strong&gt;used&lt;/strong&gt; machines on Dutch coffee sites. Obviously, you wouldn't pay full retail price for a used machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At around $/€100, I think a used but good quality Moccamaster could be an alternative to a new brewer at that same price. For that price, you get a slightly sturdier build quality (copper coil for heating the water and a metal body). At the retail price, you are paying for the brand an the nostalgic factor as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Dried and cured hemp will absorb liquids, so they do filter some oil. The material isn't as porous as paper though, so it won't absorb as much as paper. Consider it in between metal and paper in this regard. Also, the absorption properties of hemp will degrade with saturation. This is true for paper filters too, but since hemp are reusable, remember to wash them with soap that removes oil (like Dawn) regularly. More often when brewing dark roasts and extra often with extra oily dark roasts.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What mechanism in premium manual coffee grinders allows coffee grounds to come out uniform?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm researching the difference between premium manual grinders and cheap manual grinders. In simple language, what is the 'technology' that allows for consistent grounds on premium grinders that the cheaper ones lack?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of differences in a premium grinder compared to an inexpensive one.  Some affect their ability to produce more uniform grounds, and some affect other characteristics that people are willing to pay more for.  The uniformity of the grounds is mainly affected by two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is the burr construction, which Ram Pari's answer talks about.  Inexpensive burrs can do more crushing than cutting, which produces more fines and odd size shards.  Sharp, precision burrs with a good pattern and good materials cut the beans to a uniform size, with less production of fines and shattered scraps, and they stay sharp longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other main factor is the mechanics of keeping the burrs in precise alignment, and a precise distance apart as determined by the setting.  Uniform particle size relies on the burrs being perfectly concentric so the openings that let the grounds out are the same size all the way around.  The burrs also can't change their separation distance as the amount of grounds between them changes.  Inexpensive grinders have a lot of wobble, especially as the grind setting goes coarser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you crank the handle, you put a lot of sideways force on the rod that turns the movable burr.  Coffee beans also act like wedges and try to push the burrs apart while they are being cut.  Both effects try to push the moveable burr out of being concentric with the fixed burr, or try to tilt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inexpensive grinder allows this to happen, so the movable burr wobbles. This puts the burrs closer together on one side and farther apart on the other, which lets finer grounds out of one side and coarser ones out of the other.  A high quality grinder will have a very robust mechanism that allows the movable burr to rotate but not tilt or move out of concentricity.  On some inexpensive grinders, the design of the adjustment mechanism is another weak area that allows play in the burr at coarser settings.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What can cause water to come out of the portafilter sprouts?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently bought a Gaggia Classic and have noticed that what happens sometimes is I'm getting very weak coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, if I'm doing a double-shot, the first 20-30ml that comes out appears to be normal, black coffee, but the liquid coming out the sprouts then quickly turns clear, as if the coffee somehow &amp;quot;ran out&amp;quot; and I'm getting hot water instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can cause this? Is it to do with the grind, the tamper or something related to the machine (temperature, pressure)?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;To me, this sounds like &lt;strong&gt;channeling&lt;/strong&gt;. When you brew espresso the machine pushes water through a puck of compressed coffee grounds. Ideally, the grounds are distributed equally throughout the puck so that the water passes through the puck evenly. In reality, there will always be small inconsistencies. These inconsistencies allow water to move through slightly faster, possibly moving some of the inconsistent grounds along the way. When too many grounds are moved so that there is an opening from the top to the bottom of the puck, you've got a channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The channel provides a path of low resistance through the puck, so a lot of the water will pass through there rather than through the compressed parts of the puck. This extra water flow through the channel will widen it even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water passing through the channel comes into contact with only a small portion of the grounds in the puck. As such, the grounds around the channel are overextracted while the water coming out is lightly colored and overly bitter. It's lightly colored because it has less contact with the grounds. Nevertheless, it will be bitter because the grounds in the channel are already fully extracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm that your puck has actually suffered from channeling, simply look at the top of the puck after brewing. If the channel is big enough, you will see some holes in the puck (while it's still in the portafilter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a naked portafilter (one where you can see the bottom of the filter basket) you will be able to see channeling during the brew process. An even extraction will be a gentle singular stream whereas channeling will look like thin high pressure streams. Because a video says more than a wall of text, I'd recommend watching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHG1EWbrk9Q&amp;amp;ab_channel=WholeLatteLove" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this video by Whole Latte Love on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you don't have a naked portafilter, it will be interesting to see how espresso exits the portafilter. Note that the shots in the video are all pretty good with some minor channeling. If the tamp is really bad (not shown in the video), I would expect there to be many more of those tiny jets which turn lighter in color fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Is there actually any taste (especially flavor) difference between Dalgona method and normal method of making instant cofffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The coffee that concerns me is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.in/Nescaf%C3%A9-Classic-Coffee-100g-Glass/dp/B00VK0FTP0/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=nescafe%20classic&amp;amp;qid=1620651620&amp;amp;sr=8-8" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Here's a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/PSf5RCbTtyY?t=142" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; about Dalgona (most likely it's Dalgona) method coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video is in Hindi, but I'll translate it in English from 2.35s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says, &amp;quot;Let's shuffle/mix it for some time. This shuffling is done because when you do it, the coffee granules/particles release its &lt;em&gt;flavors&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I've heard similar &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt; about &lt;em&gt;flavor&lt;/em&gt; thing heard from a few of my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case 2:&lt;/strong&gt; One comment under my &lt;a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/102511/can-you-make-coffee-by-boiling-it"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; question says you can make this kind of coffee by just adding boiling water and milk and you're done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going to use instant coffee, just pour hot water on it, add
milk to taste, and you're done&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can use the method suggested by Chris H, as ingredients are same and it will save a lot of my precious time but I'm just surprised I don't see any tutorial on it on YouTube. So I wonder if it is right method or wrong or it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a right method but pretty rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, do both methods actually cause a difference in taste about its flavor or make it more thick? I mean the flavor reason given by the YouTube user is actually a scientific reason? Or could be just his personal opinion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Of course, there would be a difference in taste, but I'm more concerned about his &lt;em&gt;flavor&lt;/em&gt; logic)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Why I think that the YouTube user is right about &lt;em&gt;releasing flavors&lt;/em&gt; thing is because it turns to creamy thing after some time. So it feels like something has chemically changed inside it. So I feel that's the reason it tastes different. But I need to verify this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;My first instinct was to answer “no way, that’s instant coffee, where there’s no complex flavor to start with, we can stir the heck out of it and get no change”. On the other side, preparation &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make a huge difference sometimes, so just dismissing the method shouldn’t be done either. Of course there’s only one way to tell, which is by doing a side-by-side comparison. And that’s what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s3F1e.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s3F1e.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two identical cups with one teaspoon instant coffee (Nestlé Gold decaf) and white sugar each. I used a measuring spoon to make sure that each cup had the same amount of product in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To one I added one teaspoon of milk and one teaspoon of water, both hot, then manually whisked until a thick and somewhat stable foam formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ik5iC.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ik5iC.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On previous occasions I used an immersion blender with a whipping disc and could make a stiffer foam. But with the comparatively small amount, that wasn’t an option. Plus the linked video also whisks by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then poured hot milk and hot water into both cups, using a kitchen scale to ensure that both cups held the same amount and the same ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially the whipped cup had a foamy layer that looked good and gave a slightly different mouthfeel. (First taste test.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cd8eX.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cd8eX.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the foam started collapsing almost immediately, and about two minutes later, there wasn’t much left. I gently pushed it to one side to show the thickness of the layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hla1g.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hla1g.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enlisted the help of a family member and did a blind taste test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without the foam, there’s no taste difference whatsoever between the two methods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, for a plain cup of instant coffee, I wouldn’t bother with all that stirring and whipping.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;That looks very much like aluminum oxide, caused by exposure of aluminum to oxygen in the air. Don't worry. However unsightly it looks, it's not dangerous. You should be able to remove it with white vinegar or a solution of vinegar in water. Wet a soft cloth or soft-bristled brush with it and gently scrub.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Inconsistent milk consistency from frother</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have an automatic milk frother similar to this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoMGC.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoMGC.jpg" alt="milk frother" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue I'm having is that the milk froth that is produces is completely inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for microfoam consistency that you normally get with a flat white, like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fY1pf.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fY1pf.jpg" alt="microfoam" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But often I get really large bubbles that you get with a cappuccino, like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hzpJ4.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hzpJ4.jpg" alt="large bubbles" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There doesn't seem to be any pattern between getting the microfoam vs. large bubbles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The milk &lt;strong&gt;fat content&lt;/strong&gt; (and usually brand) is consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The milk &lt;strong&gt;temperature&lt;/strong&gt; is the same (out of the same fridge).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The milk &lt;strong&gt;quantity&lt;/strong&gt; that I put in the frother is the same (I pour it up to a specific line each time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The frothing &lt;strong&gt;duration&lt;/strong&gt; is the same (as far as I know) - it's all automated, but I don't stop it prematurely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any idea why I'm getting such unreliable results?  I'd like to know how to get the microfoam each time I make a coffee, but it seems to be luck of the draw each time.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The short answer here is that that device is not up to the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how microfoam is typically achieved in coffee shops compared to this device. Espresso shops use steam for a reason. Steam is a very effective mechanism for injecting both steam and air into milk while simultaneously agitating the milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your device, on the other hand, heats the milk from the bottom and stirs it with a little paddle attached to a motor. The stirring action pulls air in and incorporates it into the milk via stirring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steam method is more effective at producing microfoam because you can control the amount of air injected. You have no control when using this device, so the device is designed to overcompensate. It uses a slow heating method and aggressive stirring to achieve a high degree of frothing because many people who use this type of frother are comparing it to a stick frother and not to a steam wand.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>French Press: why do grounds sit at the bottom of the pressor before I press it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how to explain this, but my question is that before I press it the grounds are already at the bottom of the pressor and the coffee seems &amp;quot;light&amp;quot;. The taste is also quite sour (but I believe this is because I let it steeped longer that 4 minutes?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it because the ground is too coarse? Attaching the image below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Y0Iv.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Y0Iv.jpg" alt="This is the coffee ground's size" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the help!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It is perfectly normal for the grounds to fall to the bottom relatively soon, even before pressing. In fact, you don't even need to press, you can just use the plunger as a strainer when you're done brewing. If your coffee tastes too sour, it is most probably &lt;strong&gt;underextracted&lt;/strong&gt;. A weak (&amp;quot;light&amp;quot;) body also hints at underextraction. To increase extraction you can let it brew for a longer amount of time, use hotter water, stir it or (the only really sane and repeatable solution) &lt;strong&gt;grind the coffee finer&lt;/strong&gt;. As with all recipes for coffee: try to keep it as repeatable and consistent as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What can cause an overly acid espresso brew?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I went into this new specialty coffee shop today, they had a nice place and very informative brochures about the coffee beans they were using that day, happened to be a top quality Brazilian product whose the beans looked nicely roasted, the barista showed expertise in preparing my espresso and answered all my questions with patience. I was savoring my coffee even before it was served, but it was a big disappointment, the brew was extremely acidic (we are talking lemon-juice acid here) and with a such a rough texture that  dulled my tongue to other flavors. I did not enjoy my coffee at all. I complained to the barista about the acidity (as we had discussed acidity and he assured me that the coffee was not acidic at all) and he offered to prepare a new coffee with the same result. My question is, given that Brazilian coffee beans are probably the least acidic ones, what could have gone wrong with the brewing to yield such awful tasting product ?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;While I cannot answer with certainty if the coffee was indeed &amp;quot;awful&amp;quot; because there is no way for me to know, I can answer with a few things that can make espresso more acidic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roast level&lt;/strong&gt;. When coffee is roasted it starts to gain sweetness (it's essentially caramelising) and roasty notes like chocolate and nuts. This happens at the expense of acidity and fruity flavours.
Places that sell specialty coffee usually have lighter roasts, so that the origin characteristics of the beans do not get lost. While light roasts can undoubtedly be sweet too, they tend to be more acidic and complex than darker roasts. Because espresso is so concentrated and more intense than filter coffee, many shops even roast their beans differently for filter and espresso, to prevent the exact thing that happened to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variety&lt;/strong&gt;. Some varieties of Arabica tend to be more acidic than others. For example, the varieties Marsellesa, Starmaya, and SL28 will generally be more acidic and complex than Caturra and Mundo Novo. Of course, the roast level will also impact the acidity that is perceived in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing&lt;/strong&gt;. In general, simple terms, there are two ways of drying the coffee bean - with its cherry still attached or with the cherry removed and washed away. The former is called &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; and the latter method is called &lt;em&gt;washed&lt;/em&gt;. Because natural coffee is in contact with the cherry (which is a fruit of course) for a longer time, some of the flavours of the cherry can end up in the bean, which give the coffee a more balanced taste, making it seem less acidic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Under)extraction&lt;/strong&gt;. When extracting coffee with any method, you want to be in the sweet spot for extraction. If you brew it for too long, it will taste bitter, dry, powdery, or dusty. On the other hand, if you brew it too fast it will be underextracted and taste &lt;strong&gt;sour&lt;/strong&gt;, vegetal, or bland. Get it right and the coffee should taste sweet, complex, fruity, and slightly acidic (not like a lemon but think more of a pleasantly juicy green apple).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these things considered, it is important to note that for someone who is used to classically roasted coffee, which you can get at most cafes, specialty coffee will definitely be much more acidic than they are used to.
It very well may be that the barista was convinced and genuinely thought that the coffee wasn't acidic compared to the other coffees he had.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why is my dalgona coffee foamy instead of creamy?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;A dalgona coffee with cold milk is my go-to summer drink. I discovered this golden coffee beauty during the last summer lockdown and since then did not stop drinking it.
Since I started last year I am following the same recipe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 tbsp instant coffee or espresso powder&lt;br /&gt;
1 tbsp sugar&lt;br /&gt;
2 tbsp very hot water&lt;br /&gt;
ca. 300ml/13fl oz milk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixing the ingredients above except the milk with a hand mixer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(slightly changed recipe from &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/dalonga_coffee_20606" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/dalonga_coffee_20606&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, my dalgona cream always had a very creamy texture, almost like whipped cream, see below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PQIjv.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PQIjv.jpg" alt="creamy dagona coffee" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the last two times, my coffee cream got frothy, like a milk foam instead. I know that reduced sugar can lead to more frothy and less creamy foam, but as said, I did follow the exact same recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any idea why the foam is not creamy anymore? And I get a froth instead? Could this be due to mixing it on a higher/quicker level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to have my coffee cream back. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any idea why the foam is not creamy anymore? And I get a froth instead? &lt;strong&gt;Could this be due to mixing it on a higher/quicker level?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, absolutely. Rudimentary speaking the process of whipping something is adhering air bubbles to the fats in your mix (similar to soap bubbles, where the fats act as the soap). The finer these air bubbles are, the finer and more creamy the mixture appears. If you whack it at high speed, it will create large air pockets, which at the next time the whisk comes around at speed either collapse, or create more large air bubbles. Mixing at lower speeds will create smaller bubbles, which at next rotation can subdivide into smaller and smaller bubbles, giving you the smooth consistency you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't go too low though, as you'll just be stirring the mixture instead and not incorporating any air. The best way to create the right consistency is doing so on a &amp;quot;medium&amp;quot; setting taking roughly 5-6 minutes to whip up your coffee (or longer depending on the amount of mix, more mix takes more time).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Inconsistent flow rate of espresso with ESE pods</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;(Just to be clear, I am aware of millions of questions on the internet about consistently bad flow but my question is about a situation where, most of the time, with ESE, it works very well... And ALL of the time, with loose coffee, it works very well)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using the machine with loose coffee for years without problem.
While chasing the perfect cup, I started experimenting with different ESE pod brands available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I've tried 4 different pods. One just sucked (very famous brand), the other three: When they work well, they make an absolutely perfect coffee: Resinous, almost like oil, beautiful aroma and crema, clear but very dark color and an amazing taste - just bitter enough and none of that weird sourness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, about 1 out of 3 pods flows really slow and makes no crema. Flavor is sour (you'd think if it flows that slow, it shouldn't be under-developed, right?) and generally not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/10 pods, on the other hand, flows way too fast, result is a lot of crema but the stuff under it is basically water...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reverted to loose coffee - the machine works the same way it did for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible ESE pods have such a high defect rate? You'd think that with the excellent coffee they make when they do work, it must not be a quality issue...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the machine is not good (or old) and responds very badly to slight deviations from the ESE specification?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would appreciate any thought on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a water softener. So, very little limescale in our appliances. Anyway, appliance inside looks fine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also tried loosening the coffee inside the ESE pod - doesn't appear to do much&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, I suspect the problem may have to do with your filter basket. There are two types of filter baskets: pressurized and regular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular filter baskets have many tiny holes through which the espresso drops down after the water has passed through the coffee puck. In this filter baskets, the coffee puck should provide enough resistance for pressure to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressurized filter baskets have a single hole (when looking at the bottom; from the inside it may seem like there's a mesh structure of holes) which builds pressure regardless of the coffee puck. For example, this allows you to brew an espresso with much coarser grinds because the pressure will build because of the basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESE pods don't provide enough resistance on their own. As such, to use it in a portafilter machine you would need to use a pressurized filter basket. Whole Latte Love has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvlifEL2xBE" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a Youtube video showing how to use pods in a Gaggia espresso machine&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to using a (single-shot) pressurized filter basket, they recommend adding a 'defuser' between the filter basket and the spout of the portafilter to prevent coffee from spraying out.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why do I get a better cup when the coffee package isn't opened for a while?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I usually brew V60 at home with recently roasted beans that I grind right before brewing my coffee. I like fruity notes in my coffee, and what I noticed is that the first cup I make after opening the package is usually the most aromatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't surprise me much because I can understand that the most volatile aromatics might be dissipating quickly after I open the bag. But what I noticed is that if I keep the bag closed for a while (a week or two) the coffee again tastes better when I brew it compared to the consecutive brews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would that be the case?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;What we experience as &amp;quot;flavor&amp;quot; is really aromas we smell with our noses. And what we are smelling is volatile (= easily evaporated) chemicals from the beans or grounds. These aromas evaporate from the surface of the beans (or grounds) and dissipate in the air. That's why coffee loses flavor as it ages if it is not kept tightly sealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you leave the container sealed for a few weeks, the volatile aromas work their way from the interior of the beans (or grounds) to the surface where they are available to contribute to the aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Grind size for moka vs. espresso machine</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Should the grind size for moka pots be as fine as that for pump espresso machines? I've seen some say mokas need fine grind size; others say fine/medium.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the grind size for moka pots be as fine as that for pump espresso machines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, pump espresso machines generally require a finer grind than moka pots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot#Moka_coffee_characteristics" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;moka pots operate at low pressure&lt;/a&gt;, 2 bar at the most. Pump espresso machines, on the other hand, brew at a much &lt;a href="https://knowyourgrinder.com/what-is-espresso-machine-bar-pressure/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;higher pressure of 8 to 10 bar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does this affect grind size? In moka pots you don't want to grind too fine because the device is built for low pressure. If you grind too fine and tamp it really well then the water might not pass through as well at that low pressure. That can cause the brew to take a lot longer or it might trigger the emergency pressure valve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With espresso machines (assuming you're using a regular filter basket, not a pressurized one) you need that finer grind so that pressure can build up. If the grind is too coarse then the water will flow through easily at lower pressure and you don't get an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso#Brewing" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;espresso as prescribed by some&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it's possible to brew coffee using an espresso machine at lower pressure. Instead of making an espresso, that can be used to get a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;lungo&lt;/a&gt; using the same brew time.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a dark blend, Latin inspired (particularly Cuba), made with 100% Arabica beans, less of a caffeine kick but is also less bitter, and still has the distinctive full body of the regular blend. Some reviewers described it as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Densely bitter; heavy rather than full. Some sweet, raisin-like fruit struggles to get out from under the bitter weight of the cup.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What happens if I use relatively short burrs (55mm) to grind lightly roasted coffee as opposed to longer (65mm+) ones?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am making the first steps towards drinking a decent/good coffee at home (where I also work). My shortlist was composed of Lelit-PL72, MACAP M42M, EUREKA MIGNON SPECIALITA 16CR, and Eureka Mignon XL 65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading through forums and seeing product reviews, I favor the Eureka ones, but I am not sure how to choose between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that Mignon XL has longer burrs (65mm) as opposed to MIGNON SPECIALITA's 55mm and I remember to have read somewhere that &lt;strong&gt;for lightly roasted coffee (which I prefer), longer burrs are preferred.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is my first (kind of) professional grinder, I would not want to buy something as expensive as Mignon XL, unless there is a significant difference in results between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if I choose to grind lightly roasted coffee with shorter burrs? Is it going to take longer (which I do not mind), wear the burrs more (not important either, since I would not go beyond 3 double espressos per day), feel a significant difference in texture or taste?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Approximate age of ground coffee at the store</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;For an average bag of ground coffee on the shelf at a major grocery store (let's say Peet's or Starbucks, not Folgers), how many days would you guess have elapsed since:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The roasted beans were ground&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The green beans were roasted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there's no single answer, but maybe a median?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I just had the same question.  I picked a different brand (Eight O'Clock), looked up the company's web site, found the &lt;em&gt;Contact Us&lt;/em&gt; link, and shot them a message asking for essentially the same information.  That's an easy way to find out for any brand you're interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got two useful bits of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My question was about roasted whole beans, not ground.  That company believes those are &amp;quot;fresh&amp;quot; for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean the coffee on the shelf is a year old.  They stamp a date on the package that is one year from the roasting date.  So knowing their labeling policy tells you exactly when the beans were roasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large grocery chains are very cognizant of product turnover, and that is typically computerized, both for inventory and sales planning/analysis.  They try to purchase in appropriate quantities so stuff doesn't linger long on their shelves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just go shopping and check the dates on the packages once you know how to interpret it for that brand.  You may well find coffee packages that are still actually within a reasonable period of freshness.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>"bald" spots when brewing espresso, seen with naked portafilter</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When I brew espresso, I often get &amp;quot;bald&amp;quot; spots where no espresso is running through the some parts of the filter basket. Or in other words, I can see the filter basket screen whilst brewing coffee. I reckon this ins't the right terminology so here's a picture of what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yz5BN.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yz5BN.jpg" alt="the &amp;quot;bald&amp;quot; spots whilst brewing espresso" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My setup is a Lelit Bianca with a VST basket and one of these &amp;quot;nanotech&amp;quot; shower screens. I grind with a Baratza Sette 270wi but I single dose the coffee (i.e. I'm not using the built-in weighing function of that grinder). The coffee is fresh (~7 days from roasting) specialty coffee, light to medium roast. The pump pressure is set to ~9 bars and for the sake of fixing this issue I'm not using the pressure profiling functionality of the Bianca. It's full stream for 5 secs (pre-infusion), then off for 4 secs and then on again to brew the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put 18 grams of coffee in and I'm aiming for ~38g of coffee out in 25 seconds after the first drop of espresso lands in the cup. With the pre-infusion that means the Bianca's shot timer will show something like 34 seconds (9 sec of pre-infusion -- 5 on, 4 off) + 25 sec for the actual brew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I carefully prepare my freshly ground coffee with some WDT and a tamp. To me, my puck prep is looking okay because can see that the first bits of coffee show up more or less evenly all across the basket. Here's a picture of what it usually looks like on the first drop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8tbMK.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8tbMK.jpg" alt="the first drop" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first drops fall into the cup everything starts to look nice for maybe 5 seconds but then the &amp;quot;bald spots&amp;quot; start appearing. Here's a picture of what I think is looking nicely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uy45S.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uy45S.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to depend a little bit on the coffee I use. Sometimes it happens more and with other coffees it happens a bit less. But there's always the tendency (or with some coffees every single shot) for the bald spots to appear pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I doing wrong here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things that don't seem to matter much here are grinding either finer or coarser: As you'd expect that greatly affects how fast the espresso is running through but the bald spots don't disappear. Also reducing the pressure or trying different kinds of flow profiles also don't seem to really affect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the wet puck usually looks okay, there are no obvious signs of bad channeling at least to me. Here some pictures of the spent pucks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Erzmj.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Erzmj.jpg" alt="the wet puck" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't see anything obviously wrong here but I might be missing something. In case it helps, here's a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/P1o8nt8BWv8" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of a shot affected by this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is 270ml of coffee in a 6-cup Bialetti Moka attainable with the correct grind size?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have just bought a 6-cup Bialetti Moka Express, and the user manual quotes its 300 ml reservoir should result in 270 ml of coffee.&lt;br&gt;
However, I have conducted some tests, and unless the grind size is around kosher salt, I am unable to get more than 100 ml out of it. I control the heat to have a stable flow. When the bubbles start I remove the heat and cool the pot down with cold water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does extracting so little coffee when compared to the manual quoted figure an indication anything is wrong?&lt;br&gt;

  <title>Blade grinder vs. single mug?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;For &amp;quot;utility&amp;quot; coffee drinking, I &lt;strong&gt;temporarily&lt;/strong&gt; need to grind coffee with something as inexpensive as possible, and would prefer something with a motor.  My understanding is that fresh beans ground with a blade grinder at brewing time will still be significantly better than old ground coffee.  So I'm looking at inexpensive blade grinders, and have a question about blade design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On some models, the blades sit fairly high off the base of the grinding cup (these are sold as coffee grinders, not general purpose grinders).  They are advertised as handling enough beans for 10-12 cups.  With that amount of coffee, the grounds will push each other around and mix in the cup.  However, I'd be grinding just a couple of coffee measures at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of pictures from the product information for one such grinder (Proctor Silex 80402):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5XAP9.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5XAP9.png" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHv5F.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHv5F.png" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B09C2FPQXQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first picture, you can see the large gap below the blades.  The second picture shows some small amount of ground beans sitting completely below the blades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like for a small amount of coffee, the beans would quickly break up into chunks small enough to drop below the blades.  Then they would pretty much just sit there and not get ground finer as the blades spun above them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if people here have experienced that problem with blade grinders of a similar design, or would even a couple of measures of coffee be enough to go well over the top of the blades, so the grounds do mix and circulate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone doesn't want to admit on the site to using a blade grinder, feel free to preface any answers with &amp;quot;I read somewhere...&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Long, long ago before I knew anything about coffee...&amp;quot;.  :-)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;From personal experience the blade grinder moves the air around the beans enough to get a smaller amount moving, but if getting everything ground to consistency is the goal, I found that shaking the grinder while it's grinding helps quite a bit. Something that also helped was to pulse the grinder off and on instead of holding it on for the duration of the grind. It took some experimentation to work well, and even then it was still a cheap grinder, but it'll get the job done for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I assumed this wouldn't work in the way you'd hope.

  <title>Single use coffee bags vs pods</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Where I live (large American city) you can only find one brand (Folgers) of coffee sachets. Whereas pods are commonly available and many brands, flavors, variety exists. I would imagine sachets are a much better option as they don’t require a dedicated machine. Is there some issue with sachets that leads to them being so unpopular?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: Folgers isn’t exactly known for great coffee so I’m not surprised that their sachets don’t make good coffee. Would a better coffee make good sachet coffee? Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;We have different brands here, but I've found the bags to be consistently disappointing, a rather expensive way to get bad coffee.  I'd never use them at home.  Neither would I use pods again; they're just too expensive and wasteful, though they can taste pretty decent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bags end up weak, however much you stir/press them and however long you leave them in.  Using double is better but still disappointing.  At home, when I don't have time to make my moka pot for just me, I have a resuable one-cup drip filter, and in work I use an aeropress.  Both are also more environmentally friendly as the only per-cup waste is the actual grounds that get composted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do use bags occasionally - hotels here tend to have kettles in the rooms but no way of making acceptable coffee (we're stereotypically a nation of tea-drinkers).  The bags are useful then for the odd night.  When travelling light for longer, including when bikepacking, I use a coffee sock, just a cheesecloth pouch sized to fit in a mug.  The grounds make much better contact with the water than in coffee bags.&lt;/p&gt;

Earlier I used to brew without using the middle small instrument which looks like the one used in a french press for &amp;quot;pressing&amp;quot;. It still used to give me a good brew. In few minutes I used to get a fresh brew. I don't know why, but suddenly it is taking longer to finish the brew and sometimes (mostly from the second time) the water doesn't even go down. It just stays in the upper part of the instrument. The &lt;a href="https://mysoreconcernscoffee.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;coffee powder&lt;/a&gt; I use is unchanged and so is the filter. I checked if the pores of the filter are blocked, but that is also not the case. They are all clearly opened. I wash it regularly. I tried using and not using the middle pressing instrument. No effect on the result. So I don't know what's exactly wrong and why this sudden change has happened. One thing that is different is that I have stored the coffee powder for a longer while this time (still not more than half a month). Can it make a difference? Does the powder have a shelf-life? Has anyone faced this problem? How did you solve it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the coffee has absorbed moisture while stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd suggest buying some very fresh coffee and trying that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the problem goes away, it's the old coffee that's the problem.&lt;br /&gt;
If the problem still happens with the new coffee, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; is the time to investigate what is wrong with the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be more clear, &lt;a href="https://www.gourmia.com/item.asp?item=10354" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this is the exact coffee maker I'm using&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Starbucks-Pumpkin-Spice-Ground-Flavored-Coffee-100-Arabica-Naturally-Flavored-17-oz/566582409?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;amp;selectedSellerId=0&amp;amp;wl13=220&amp;amp;adid=22222222277566582409_117755028669_12420145346&amp;amp;wmlspartner=wmtlabs&amp;amp;wl0=&amp;amp;wl1=g&amp;amp;wl2=c&amp;amp;wl3=501107745824&amp;amp;wl4=pla-294505072980&amp;amp;wl5=9027209&amp;amp;wl6=&amp;amp;wl7=&amp;amp;wl8=&amp;amp;wl9=pla&amp;amp;wl10=8175035&amp;amp;wl11=local&amp;amp;wl12=566582409&amp;amp;wl13=220&amp;amp;veh=sem_LIA&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwtKmaBhBMEiwAyINuwA8tH_k27rQ_NXn-FR1ey-1mx7sxcDWAEykS3KGVNitIyMMCutLbUxoC0jQQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this is the coffee grounds I'm using.&lt;/a&gt; The coffee and the coffee maker have 2 different directions, so I've tried following them both, but they both don't seem to come out too correctly. I'm trying to make it iced, as the machine has iced as an option (although it still brews with hot water so I don't think it would interfere that much with how it comes out). Also, I'm not sure what brew method it's sold for as asked by fixer, because the only directions the coffee actually has is just 1) use 1 and a half tablespoons of coffee and 2) add 6 fluid ounces of cold filtered water. But the only videos I've seen of people making this use hot water?? As a side note, I just went ahead and tried making it the hot option instead of the iced option on the maker, and it came out darker, but it still tasted super bitter, although I'm not sure whether to follow the coffee machine's instructions or whats on the bag with the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick edit - Right after I made the hot coffee I tried icing it and adding creamer. It looked a whole lot more like the real starbucks version, but it didn't really taste like too much. I didn't add all that much creamer, only 5 teaspoons for a relatively big(ish) glass.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to do coffee tasting or cupping</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently learned there is coffee cupping. I have always enjoyed coffee but do not think I have a developed palette for it or know much about it. How can I start to develop my palette and start doing some coffee cupping?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of good information online to get started. A great one is this James Hoffmann video: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSEgP4VNynQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How To Cup (Taste) Coffee At Home&lt;/a&gt;. If you're just starting out, he provides a common-sense explanation and method for basic coffee tasting that strips out a lot of the complexities used in professional or commercial tasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist of cupping is that it uses a simple brewing method that isn't influenced by the person's technique.  Standardized conditions ensure that everything is brewed the same, in a way that produces properly-extracted coffee of normal-strength.  The brewing method is similar to French press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It adds the tasting method of slurping the coffee from a spoon.  That removes more potential variation.  Each sample is a uniform amount.  The slurping action sprays the coffee around the inside of your mouth to stimulate the different taste and smell sensors in a uniform way that enhances your ability to experience the flavor and aroma components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee cupping has a home use in addition to comparing coffees or developing your ability to differentiate flavors.  If you're just getting into exploring brewing methods and &amp;quot;recipes&amp;quot;, it's easy for the experiments to produce brews that don't taste like what you expect.  After a few of those, you start asking yourself, &amp;quot;what is this coffee supposed to taste like when it's properly brewed?&amp;quot;  Cupping it will give you a good flavor baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Seeking a system for Baratza Encore clean-up in low humidity</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Baratza Encore and really love using it when I can.  The biggest problem I have is what happens after I'm done using it when the air is dry and static is more common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I grind, I take the grounds bin out and dump the grounds into my (aeropress/french press/bonavita), but there's always a bit of leftover grounds clung to it due to static electricity.  Here's where I get stuck with seemingly only bad choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I rinse the bin, I don't want to put it back in wet, so I leave it to dry. As soon as I move the grinder or even bump it, some grounds drop out and make a bit of a mess&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I don't rinse the bin and just put it back, stale grounds are in there the next time I want to grind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I try to wipe the bin, the grounds tend to make a mess anyway since they behave unpredictably due to static&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there some better approach or system I can use that reduces the mess without compromising the quality of my brew?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the least expensive technique for an at-home coffee brewing novice?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I don't want to spend big bucks on coffee equipment for the home, and I'm looking for something that will be consistent despite my lack of coffee-making skill and technique. &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/4115/what-is-the-best-coffee-brewing-method-to-learn-at-home-what-equipment-shall-i"&gt;This question&lt;/a&gt; led me to think maybe French Press might be a good starter at-home brew method for a novice coffee snob, but the asker was asking specifically about becoming a barista. I just want to become someone who drinks decent coffee at home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there's no clear winner, what are some pros and cons of some of the less expensive options out there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If relevant, I have to stick to decaf mostly for health reasons, and I like a splash of oat milk. I prefer a lighter and fruitier flavor with some roastiness, but not overly acidic.)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Assuming they're done properly, one brewing method isn't better than another in the sense it produces better coffee.  Different brewing methods produce different flavor profiles, and work best with certain kinds of roasts and grinds because of the mechanics of how they work.  People can have a preference for the nature of the taste a particular method produces, or the flavors of the kind of roast that is normally used with a method.  Pick the method that produces the kind of flavor you like, and involves a level of hands-on activity and technique you are willing to put in every time you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I understand correctly, the question describes not wanting a hands-on process where skill and technique could produce inconsistent results.  And you prefer a lighter and fruitier flavor with some roastiness, but not overly acidic.  That narrows down the options, and you can do that without breaking the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key to great coffee is fresh coffee, rather than working your way through a big canister of stale ground coffee.  That's part of the decision on method at low cost.  If you choose a method that relies on precision grinding, you've already built in a chunk of money for a decent grinder (plus the time to grind it).  There are three practical ways to have fresh coffee without an expensive grinder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pods.&lt;/strong&gt;  They're hermetically sealed and stay fresh until they're used.  A variety of coffees are available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commercial brewer pouches.&lt;/strong&gt;  These are hermetically sealed packages of medium grind coffee.  They're sized to be the right amount for a large carafe in a commercial drip brewer.  For brewing small batches, you can reseal the remainder of the pouch.  The remainder won't be the same as fresh coffee; it will lose a lot of the aromatics.  But using it up over a few days, there will be minimal degradation from oxidation, and it will be much closer to fresh than weeks-old coffee in a canister.  You can find popular coffee brands at places that sell office supplies (a big market is commercial drip machines in offices).  You might be able to buy higher-end coffee from a restaurant supplier if they will sell it to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole beans ground with an inexpensive grinder.&lt;/strong&gt;  An inexpensive grinder won't do a good job with uniform particle sizes.  But even a mediocre coarse grind will do well in a French press.  You might even find a medium grind OK for a drip brew (it will affect the flavor profile, but could still produce good coffee).  Coarse grinding coffee for a single serving takes trivial time with a hand grinder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like there are three obvious options that could fit your requirements (only you can determine whether the taste satisfies what you're looking for).  In order of least time and effort to make coffee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;coffee pod machine&lt;/strong&gt; like a Keurig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; The simplest, most convenient way to make coffee.  Zero skill or technique required.  Very drinkable coffee, consistently made every time.  No problem with ground coffee going stale or a need to grind your own.  Wide variety of coffees (and other beverages) readily available, so you're likely to find one with a flavor profile you like.  No need for other coffee making paraphernalia (grinder, scale, thermometer, etc.).  Makes a single serving at a time; each cup is fresh, no dregs or reheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Cost.  You pay for the convenience and other benefits.  The coffee is more expensive, and that is ongoing.  The machines aren't cheap, but they're now competitive with good quality brewers, especially when you don't have to buy the other paraphernalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way it brews doesn't produce the quality of taste you can get from the coffee by other methods.  The coffee is very drinkable and consistent, but I doubt anybody reacts to it with &amp;quot;Wow, that was the best coffee I ever had!&amp;quot;  The coffee is good, enough so that a lot of people go with it for the convenience because no other method comes close to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;drip brewing machine&lt;/strong&gt; will give you good coffee.  A good quality machine will do a more sophisticated brew than what a cheap machine does, and extracts better flavor from the coffee.  That's what you drink in most restaurants.  A bottom-of-the line machine will be substantially cheaper.  These cut cost by simplifying the brewing process, and often don't brew with optimum-temperature water.  The coffee they produce won't be as good, but it will still be pleasant and very drinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no reliance on the user's skill or technique.  You don't need any other equipment for this option.  But you might benefit from an inexpensive digital scale.  Measuring the coffee with a scoop, it's hard to be consistent, or to adjust the ratio of coffee to water to change the concentration.  A digital scale lets you precisely measure the coffee, and accurately adjust in less-than-scoop increments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many automatic drip brewers on the consumer market justify a high price by adding tons of bells and whistles that have nothing to do with brewing good coffee (and those are additional things that can fail).  Focus on features that relate to how it brews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An automatic drip brewer is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a good single-serving machine.  Consider how many servings you will make at a time.  If you brew just for yourself, and typically drink several large cups in close proximity, look for a small-capacity brewer like a 4-cup model.  If you normally drink one cup, or a second cup is much later in the day, an automatic drip brewer is not a good choice.  A drip coffee maker, especially with a basket-shaped filter, won't brew properly unless you make at least half its capacity; the coffee layer won't be thick enough to properly control the extraction time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;French press&lt;/strong&gt; uses an inexpensive brewer.  It doesn't really require skill or technique, but there is procedure, and it's more hands-on than a drip machine.  The brew method is very similar to what's used in &amp;quot;cupping&amp;quot;, a coffee tasting procedure that evaluates the flavors in the coffee without the influence of the brewer's technique.  You can be imprecise with a French press and still get very good-tasting coffee, just not necessarily the specific good taste you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of a French press brew is a rich taste that's well-extracted (a broad, well-balanced range of flavors).  The light, fruity flavors you like are highlighted by a lighter extraction (a drip brewer would highlight them more); they can get hidden by the kinds of flavors that come later in the extraction.  You can adjust the French press extraction to make it a little lighter, but to do that, you need to brew with more precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;When SS cookware is made, a mechanical polishing process using very fine abrasives is used to make it shiny. Sometimes this process leaves a residue that cannot be removed by hand or dishwashing.
To clean a stainless steel item that has black residue, spread a small amount of olive oil on the inside of the item. Let it sit and then wipe the oil out. After that, proceed to wash with dish soap and hot water.
Other recommendations are to gently scrub using a mixture of lemon juice and salt and then wash.Some SS cookware comes with instructions to scrub it gently with a 1:1 mix of baking soda and warm water before using the pans.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Role of "time before crust breaking" in cupping</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;One of the instructions for cupping is to wait 4 minutes before breaking the crust and removing floating stuff. It is also said (for instance by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSEgP4VNynQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;James Hoffmann&lt;/a&gt;) that at that point the brewing process is stopped. This is not clear to me and I have a couple of questions in particular which are all related:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would the brewing process stop?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the role of the time spent before breaking?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why 4 minutes? What would happen with much shorter or much longer times?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried to cup the same coffee with two different times before breaking (2min vs 8min) and I couldn't notice any difference, so I'm quite puzzled.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h3&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would the brewing process stop?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the role of the time spent before breaking?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's brewing-related stuff happening during that time, and crust-related stuff happening during that time, and they're mostly not related.  It isn't so much the &amp;quot;role&amp;quot; of the time spent up to that point, as it is various things are ongoing and at a somewhat arbitrary point you break up the crust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why 4 minutes? What would happen with much shorter or much longer times?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within reason, it wouldn't make much difference, at least that you would likely be able to tell.  For cupping purposes, the more important aspect is that the procedure be consistent.  It needs to happen at some point, and a time in the ballpark of 4 minutes is a good compromise to get the most benefit from the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Explanation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Hoffmann does say in that video that you're stopping the brewing process, but I think that was an over-simplification.  That great video is designed to simplify the process for beginners and explain the gist and some of the concepts involved.  That statement isn't literally correct, but I'll explain what he's probably referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's going on with the brewing and what's going on with the crust are basically independent processes.  Breaking up the crust doesn't really relate to the brewing, it's coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brewing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If breaking up the crust stopped the brewing, that would suggest that most of the coffee grounds are in the crust and being extracted there.  When you send them to the bottom, that stops the brewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the reverse.  Only a small portion of the grounds are in the crust, they contribute little to the extraction while they're suspended in the foam, and the rest of the grounds are responsible for most of the extraction independent of what's happening in or to the crust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two concurrent brewing-related processes that start when you pour the water into the cupping bowls: extraction of the coffee solubles from the grinds and settlement of the coffee particles to the bottom of the bowl.  These both continue until you empty the bowl.  For both, the bulk of it happens quickly and then tapers off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the extraction happens in the first few minutes.  After that, the brew continues to get a little bit stronger and the flavor profile fills out a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For settlement, the &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; stuff (normal-size grounds), falls to the bottom quickly, so it isn't a consideration, and it accounts for most of the coffee grounds.  The fines (dust-size coffee particles), account for a tiny amount of the coffee, but it's important for those to settle to the bottom so you don't taste them during cupping (there's no filtration in this procedure).  While the water is initially very hot, the fines don't do much settling.  As the water cools down, they slowly settle to the bottom.  By the time the brew temperature drops to a drinkable range, most of the fines have settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So brewing is the important thing going on in the first few minutes.  When most of the extraction is done, that is about when most of the fines start to settle out.  So you can think of it as a &amp;quot;brewing phase&amp;quot; then a &amp;quot;settlement phase&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time normally selected to break up the crust roughly coincides with when the &amp;quot;brewing phase&amp;quot; can be thought to end, but that's just a way to conceptualize the process.  There is no hard transition point, and both processes are ongoing.  Breaking up the crust doesn't cause any change in the brewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Crust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crust is a combination of coffee foam, oils, and floating grounds.  As water soaks into the coffee particles, it pushes out gas (mostly carbon dioxide), that collected after roasting.  The gas rises to the surface, taking some lighter coffee particles with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking up the crust might affect things in a subtle way.  The crust might act as an insulating blanket.  The brew loses heat through the cup, but the crust may reduce heat loss into the air.  So it would keep the brewing temperature a little higher a little longer.  To that extent, breaking up the crust would help the temperature drop a little faster, slowing down extraction, especially of flavors associated with over-extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, the crust needs to be broken up in order to get at the coffee for tasting.  When's the best time to do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to give the floating stuff time to settle before you taste the brew.  But you also want to allow enough time for all the gas to escape the grounds, and as much of it as possible to escape into the air so you aren't stirring it into the coffee when you break up the crust.  And as mentioned, the timing might have a subtle affect on the flavor profile.  The timing is a compromise.  Doing it at about 4 minutes reduces the influence of technique and balances the various considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your observation about the insensitivity to the time is basically correct, although your range of 2 minutes to 8 minutes is probably more a reflection of how sensitive and trained your palate is, or what characteristics you were looking at.  The cupping procedures I've seen range from about 3 minutes to 5 minutes, with 4 minutes being typical.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the difference between straining and using a French press?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Logic tells me that both should be the same because they both just strain the grounds. Is there any added effect of pressing down the plunger in French press?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I would say no, there is no macroscopic difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, some people (notably &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;James Hoffmann&lt;/a&gt;) advise not to press the plunger all the way down since it agitates the grounds and this could result in having more fines in the cup. You are perfectly fine using a strainer, but depending on how big the holes are you could get more fines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difference could arise by squeezing the grounds with the plunger. Maybe that way you could get an additional tiny fraction of extraction, but I believe it would be more or less undetectable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, it's a simple experiment you could try at home to convince yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything else I should do or check before using the machine again?&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As with anything electronic, it should be allowed to dry thoroughly before introducing power again. With any luck the water did not cause any short circuits or damage any parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there may be little to worry about here since the funnel leads to the brewing chamber which is designed to hold water. It appears that this funnel is only supposed to be use when the machine is in &lt;em&gt;scooped mode&lt;/em&gt; indicated by the dial. But the dial position presumably only affects the operating programme, it doesn't align the chute or open a door or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this machine, water goes in the reservoir which is removed by pulling it forward from the right hand side facing the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to regrind coffee in electric grinder</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Similar to another post I saw earlier, I was gifted a bag of coarse-ground coffee which sadly comes out too weak for my cone pour-over preparation. I know there are risks with using a burr grinder when regrinding, I'm just asking about the setting I should use. Do I use the coarsest setting, since it is already partially ground, or go straight for the grind I usually prefer (medium)? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The burrs in a burr grinder are held at a fixed distance. This distance is determined by the grind selector mechanism. In theory, this distance determines the size of grind particles, regardless of the size of input particles (whole beans, half beans, broken beans, pre-ground beans). That's why burr grinders are superior to propeller-type coffee mills which makes all particles ever smaller by bashing everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So (in theory) you should be able to set the grind you want and run the course &amp;quot;gift&amp;quot; grind through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done this, regrinding &amp;quot;French Press&amp;quot; into espresso. It worked well. It came out a bit finer than I'd planned, but perfectly usable.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I order a Magic when not in Melbourne?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When I migrated to Melbourne, Australia a couple of years ago, I asked locals what the most Melburnian coffee one could order was. The response was uniformly a &amp;quot;Magic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've then moved to Perth and the &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; here is a &amp;quot;long mac topped up&amp;quot;. Don't hate it, but it's not really my cup of coffee...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of the baristas here in my two years here understood what a Magic is. And if I'm honest, I'm not even a 100% sure what's in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my understanding, a Magic is a double ristretto with three-quarters foamed milk in a tulip cup. But I really dislike having to ask for a coffee with a long instruction like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the most concise way to order a Melbourne Magic when not in Melbourne?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A Melbourn Magic is just a double ristretto in a 150 mL cup topped up with steamed milk, flat white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not familiar with coffee offerings in Perth, but I suspect it's going to be very difficult to find a coffee shop that even carries 150 mL cups. See if you can ask for a double ristretto with an equal amount of flat white steamed milk added. It'll be inconsistent to some degree each time you order it because most coffee shops won't have the right equipment to make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively you can buy your own 150 mL / 5 oz cup and ask them to make it in that by making a double ritretto and then topping up with flat white. It's hit or miss whether they'll actually do it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Melted gasket on moka pot. How do I clean it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was running a water cycle through my moka pot and completely forgot it on the stove. When I came back in the kitchen after 30-45 minutes it smelled of burnt rubber and I found that the gasket had completely melted when I took it apart. How do I clean it, and can I even still use it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The gasket in Moka pots need to be replaced every now and then, depending on how often you use the pot. If your gasket was damaged, then you should definitely replace it, for safety reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can simply take it out, do so. If it’s stuck, you may need to gently (!) scrape it off with a flat screwdriver or knife, but be careful not to damage the metal. While you are at it, I’d also recommend to take out the screen on the underside of the top compartment (if the gasket is caked on you’ll need to do so in any case), using the occasion for a bit of cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does "to ground" have a special meaning with respect to coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;To me, the verb &amp;quot;to ground&amp;quot; seems inappropriate for this site, and I'd normally consider it simply a minor mistake or typo, but in
&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1833/what-gives-turkish-coffee-that-unique-quality"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What gives Turkish coffee that unique &amp;quot;quality&amp;quot;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
it appears in the original question, in two answers, and in a comment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;grounded coffee&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other 'turkish' grounded coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than this one word, all of the submissions are written in good English, so its usage seems to be deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a verb &amp;quot;to ground&amp;quot; in electrical technology,
but is there some coffee-technical verb &amp;quot;to ground&amp;quot; that I haven't heard of before?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's a common grammatical mistake. As our audience grows we may continue to see grammatical errors and &lt;strong&gt;that's ok&lt;/strong&gt;. We can fix it up by suggesting edits. Or sometimes you can even just ignore it if the meaning is clear enough. It's good to fix up mistakes. But it is also good to be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard English declension is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;verb infinitive: (to) grind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;present tense indicative:&lt;br /&gt;
[ I, we, you, they ] grind the coffee.&lt;br /&gt;
[ He, she ] grinds the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;past tense:&lt;br /&gt;
[ I, we, you, he, she, they ] ground the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;past participle (also, adjective): ground&lt;br /&gt;
Eg. &amp;quot;One pound of finely ground coffee.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;related: (the) &lt;em&gt;grind&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;grain&lt;/em&gt;, often refers to the size of the particles. Thus &amp;quot;fine grind&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;finely ground&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mnemonic: &amp;quot;grounded&amp;quot; means your airplane cannot fly. :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to minimize mess with an espresso maker</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I purchased a Breville Bambino Plus recently. I was previously using a Nespresso. The primary motivations for the upgrade were microfoam milk and a wider variety of flavors (Nespresso pods all tasting similar to me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a great success in those areas, but I’m struggling mightily with the mess I make each time I prepare a double shot. Coffee grounds inevitably spill at various steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I do to improve this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mess opportunities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting the grounds into the portafilter. I have to carefully mound it up before tamping and inevitably some small amount spills before I have tamped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slight excess after tamping. Despite weighing the exact dose I usually end up with a bit extra. Breville supplied a blade for this to scrape off the extra but it’s messy and if I’m not careful the whole shot flies out when I’m trying to dump the excess&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knock bar. What magic incantation is required here?  I just bang a lot and about half the time grounds fly outside the bar. Also, often the portafilter basket itself comes out which creates even more mess!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepping my next shot. Sometimes I run just water through to heat up my mug and if I do so there’s always some grounds in the portafilter along with some water. Where did they come from and is that bad?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Several things you could do come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to carefully mound it up before tamping and inevitably some small amount spills before I have tamped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check how much coffee the filter inside your portafilter is rated for. The Bambino Plus uses a non standard 54mm portafilter and from what I can see, you should have received 4 different filters. Only use the ones with straight walls and if your grounds are flowing over, you are probably using too much coffee. They say it can handle up to 18g in the largest basket but that feels like it would be too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slight excess after tamping. Despite weighing the exact dose I usually end up with a bit extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you mean you end up with a bit extra? When you tamp the grounds, it should be compressed and at that point the only thing you should do is brew the coffee and not mess around with the already prepped puck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;often the portafilter basket itself comes out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're supposed to knock with the basket towards the rubber, knocking the grounds loose and then just lift it to allow them to fall out. That way there is no possibility of the basket flying out. You will never be able to get every single piece of coffee out, which is why most people use a microfiber cloth to clean out the basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s always some grounds in the portafilter along with some water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time after knocking out the grounds and wiping the basket with a cloth, remove the basket and check if there are grounds in the space between the basket and the spout. If there are a lot of grounds there, your filter basket might have too many large holes or you are grinding too finely. If there is nothing there, check your brew head. It might be full of grounds, which is mostly caused by using too much coffee in a shot. You can clean that with a simple brush. Make sure there is no coffee stuck to the brew head as it might get rancid over time and negatively impact the taste of your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might want to check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTFsBqhpLes&amp;amp;list=PLxz0FjZMVOl3MuAzK5l3gjakoOGrmK8fP" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this video series&lt;/a&gt; on espresso by James Hoffmann, where he goes into every aspect of brewing espresso. Seeing what he does differently might give you an indication as to which things you can change or adjust to make your experience more pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt; to answer the comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the tamp doesn't fully occupy the width of the basket&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should really consider getting a tamper that is suitable for your basket, there should be barely any room between the tamper and the walls - ideally, just enough to prevent an airtight seal. It really helps to ensure even flow and it prevents loose grounds floating on top of your puck when you remove it after a brew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if I knock immediately after a shot it still makes some mess because there's a small amount of liquid in the basket&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of liquid is normal but this might also be caused by the loose coffee that wasn't tamped. It could also be caused by pulling a shot that is too long. In general, try to aim for a ratio between 1:2 (18g in 26g out) and 1:3 (18g in 44g out).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is Starbucks a fast-food like coffee company?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Well actually it is obvious that they are pretty fast. But to the proffessionals i ask : does Starbucks's coffee is not organic ? not healthy ? or includes so much chemicals ? I do realize it depends on the type and flavour of coffee but , anyway .. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I , buy at least 1 cup coffee from Starbucks a day , usually Filter coffee without milk or Americano. Should I stop shopping with them ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basicly , I'm asking if it is unhealthy to frequently drink filter coffee(without milk) or Americano from Starbucks , like if it is real coffee or something artificial ?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;As far as actual speed, that based mainly on the barista working shift, the load, and amount of available equipment.  Starbucks does not have any patented magic equipment that  lets them pull shots faster than any other coffee house (that I am aware of).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy their beverages, then there probably isn't any reason you shouldn't continue to drink it.  I would guess you are in the minority of people buy what amounts to black coffee from Starbucks.  Starbucks is a fairly divisive brand among most consumers.  Most of the people I have talked to that like their beverages are buying mixed drinks from them and not straight espresso, drip coffee or americanos.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starbucks does sell organic, fair trade and the like specialty coffees as whole bean or ground.  However, the vast majority of their beverages sold daily is likely made with whatever their "espresso" blend is.  My personal opinion is that it's horrible and over roasted.   However, it's also consistently the same tasting and consumed on a fairly mass scale daily, so if there were any inherent dangers to it, we'd likely all be aware by now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a brand, Starbucks is mainly aimed at consistency.  In general, that's what fast food chains strive for as well, so in that respect, they are very similar.  Proper branding ensures that you can buy a product at any of hundreds of locations (or thousands) and it will taste the same.  However, many consumers prize quality and uniqueness over consistency.  In most industries (distilling, wine, food, beer) the most expensive and "highest end products" are items that were perhaps only produced at a limited run, or were very good in a particular year.  That mindset tends to be the antithesis of the mass produced "good enough for everyone" standards that huge market brands set for themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;  Yes, Starbucks shares many characteristics with fast food companies.  The most notable aspect being their branding strategies and tactics.    &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much sugar can I put it my coffee before it's worse than soda?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Coffee is generally quite healthy and soda is full of sugar. However people end up putting lots of sugar in their coffees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much sugar is needed before a cup of coffee is worse than soda?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;For my calculations I'll be using Coca Cola (which has 39 grams of sugar in a single can! (375ml))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any amount of pure Coffee (no milk), you can put 39 grams of sugar or nearly 10 teaspoons of sugar, as Coffee has no sugar in it. 30ml is a standard espresso size so to be equivalent per ml of liquid you would need to put 3.1 grams of sugar which is less than a teaspoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One teaspoon in an espresso makes it contain a higher percentage of sugar than coke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a 150 ml Cappuccino which is approximately 25 ml of coffee and 85 ml of milk, (&lt;em&gt;Note that in a Cappuccino a portion of the volume is made up by froth which is why 85+25&amp;lt;150&lt;/em&gt;). Approximately 4.5 grams of sugar is from the milk which means you can still add another 34.5 grams of sugar to be equivalent to a can of coke. And to be equivalent per volume (using 110ml as the volume since the froth doesn't count as it is essentially air) you would need to add an additional 7 grams of sugar (nearly two teaspoons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two teaspoons in a cappuccino makes it contain a higher percentage of sugar than coke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can making iced coffee (with cola) on my Coffee Press harm the Press?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; iced coffee, and usually make it. If you don't know what it is, it is basically adding cola to a brewed coffee. When I brew coffee in my coffee press, there is usually enough space to add cola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to add the cola before it is brewed, but after it is brewed, in order to easily serve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can this damage the container or the press part? (The glass and metal parts)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Interesting, I have never heard of this brewing method before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of press do you own...an Aeropress/French Press? Can you post a link to the model? I wouldn't think this would hurt the press. However, it is best that you clean it more over than you would with just normal coffee - Cola tends to have a lot of added sugar/high-fructose corn syrup that could dirty the glass/plastic and quite possibly attract bugs like ants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/1743833/why-coke-cleans-rusted-metal-coca-cola-says-its-all-natural-turns-out-its-true/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Soda also contains different acids like Citric and Phosphoric.&lt;/a&gt; As we've seen on the popular show Mythbusters (and the internet alike) &lt;a href="https://snapguide.com/guides/remove-rust-with-coca-cola/" rel="nofollow"&gt;the acids can be used to polish chrome and remove rust.&lt;/a&gt;
As long as you don't have a cheap metallic press, I wouldn't worry too much about soda affecting the integrity of the metal (especially since most metal presses are made from Stainless steel).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can my tamping method damage the basket or portafilter?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have developed the following tamping method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;press the grinds with the tamper without much force, to smoothen it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;leave the tamper in the basket&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;holding the tamper and the portafilter together, whack the silicone tamping mat with the portafilter so that the inertia + my pressure drive the tamper into the grinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can damage my equipment in this way?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In general, by the majority of baristas, the recommended method to tamp is this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;safely hold the basket (with the portafilter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fill and tamp the grounds using appropriate force (5–20 kgf)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make a circular movement (180–360°) with the tamper to smooth the surface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  <title>What is the reason that Aeropress coffee is more digestible?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;For some years I could not drink coffee because it caused me instant digestive problems. I tried various kinds of preparation and beans but often it only took some minutes until the bodily reactions started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then someone suggested to use the aeropress and now I can drink coffee again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can someone tell me a reason?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I tried earlier: caffeine free coffee, espresso, old style filtered coffee, old style filters with adding cooking water by hand, modern automated coffee makers. Freshly ground, non freshly ground, mokka, adding powdered directly into the cup and surely some others I don't remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with the aeropress I used different kinds of beans and different mills, different filters (metal and paper) and never had any problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I use the aeropress: I add two spoons of coffee, put a little hot water on it. After a couple of seconds I fill up to full, wait until some water is through, then gently squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have any problems with caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The digestive problems you've experienced may be due to the acidity of the coffee. Now lighter roasted coffee will definitely be more acidic so the roast level of the bean can be at play. Not only that, but underextraction can cause high levels of acidity also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only discernible difference I can garner from what you've told me is that in the Aeropress there is a slight form of full immersion brewing. This will better encourage all parts of the coffee to be well extracted and so reduce the acidity of the resulting cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're curious as to what the real cause is, buy two different batches of beans, one medium-dark roast and one light roast. Then perform Aeropress, French press, pourover, espresso and possibly drip extractions with both beans and note down your gastric reaction to each cup. If there is almost no significant difference between any of them to how it makes you feel i.e. it seems to occur at random, you might just be hyper-sensitive to small changes in acidity caused by the differences in the imperfections of each extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Just before it grinds for the double, crank down the grind 10 (or more) clicks coarser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should exaggerate the problem so the little computer can "see" it, and apply whatever self-correction it may.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Which creates the strongest (and/or better quality) coffee? Espresso Maker vs. French Press</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;For a year I used an Espresso maker to make my morning cup of jo. Recently my maker broke and I decided to try out a french press. I originally though that the espresso maker would be stronger because it forced steam through the granules, but now am starting to lean towards a french press as long as I let it sit in the water for longer than around 5 minutes. I am basing everything on theories right now though, so I was wandering if anyone had any evidence supporting the facts on either side.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you are making just a regular black coffee, French Press would be a superior brewing method.  There are a lot of different camps on this, but rarely does an espresso machine get listed as a preferred method of brewing a cup of coffee (technically you are making Americanos I suppose since you would be diluting the espresso extract with water?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for a discussion of preferred brewing methods, it depends on what you are after.  French Press tends to lend additional body and heaviness to a cup of coffee. This is predominantly due to the fact that the water is in extended contact with the grounds (4-5 minutes) which allows less soluble molecules to extract from the grounds.  These less soluble molecules tend to have higher atomic weight, which lends a heavier mouthfeel (Modulating the Roast touches on this).  Additionally, french press doesn't filter out fines.  This adds body, but also muddles lighter flavors in the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are after a cleaner more defined cup of coffee, then I would point you to pour over or even a high quality drip brewer (Bonavita makes great coffee imo).  You are going to get better extract filtration, and the timing with water touching grounds tends to highlight the more delicate flavors in the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I am sipping on a cup of Ethiopian that has a strong raspberry flavor to it even to the untrained palette.  If I were to have brewed this in a French Press, that high note in the coffee would be obscured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more note and I'll stop rambling.. as for energy boost, I feel like espresso makes you crash and traditional brewing methods don't.  That is my experience at least.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>what makes for the difference in the price for coffee maker?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Like for a good one like Keurig, it cost like 300 dollars, while I also got one for less than 10 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes for the difference for the price difference in the coffee makers? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm going to isolate this response to only drip brewing machines since if we start talking about espresso, all my assumptions fly out the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really you pay for the following on a machine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water Temperature Control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proper design of brewing (water shower, pump rate, cone / basket design)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Older drip brewers lacked a few things.  The brewing chambers were simplistic, but the biggest downside was lack of accurate temperature control.  Water needs to ideally be right at 205 F plus or minus a few degrees depending on coffee type, roast and age.  Newer drip brewers rely on updated electronics that can accurately keep the water temperature in this narrow range which is going to give you improved coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the shower head at the top of the brew chamber.  Does it pour the water down in a single stream, or does it distribute the water nicely across the grounds?  This makes a difference in brew quality and on newer machines, more thought has gone into this design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pump rate -- if you read up on how people do pour over, a lot of focus is on timing.  Allowing the coffee to bloom, then proper water per minute rates must be adhered to.  All of these details will change the flavor of the coffee.  Newer machines again have better control over these variables due to improved electronics which allow them to produce more consistent, and hopefully better coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thermal Carafe -- I just had to throw this in here; these machines brew into an insulated carafe rather than a non-insulated carafe with heater underneath.  In my opinion, thermal carafes are amazing, and they have become much more available now that they once were.  Nothing will kill your coffee faster than a carafe 'warmer' (I mean cooker...) under a non-insulated carafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You mentioned Keurig.  Keurig is a whole different animal unfortunately.  They have managed to corner the market on a particular brewing style (which by the way is inferior to old fashioned methods), albeit more convenient.  You get the perks of the newer machines mentioned above in a $300 Keurig machine, but I don't believe the grounds chamber is big enough to actually brew a full cup of coffee, and I believe it brews too quickly to get a fully developed cup of coffee.  Read thin and bright coffee compared to pour over, french press, quality drip.  $200 bucks of the $300 goes either to the electronics of allowing you to brew a single cup at a time, validating it is a legit k-cup (they did away with the microchips in K-Cups I think?) or simply name brand.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Replace gear in Whirly-Pop with metal</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was roasting coffee using a Whirly Pop manual crank popcorn popper when one of the cheap plastic gears broke (luckily, I have 2 poppers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BgBAD.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BgBAD.jpg" alt="Bottom gear broke off!"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know where to get metal gears that could be installed in the "machine" to prevent this from happening again?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I searched and found that you can possibly get Whirly Pop to send a replacement plastic gear (which is just going to break again).  I also found that Whirly Pop sells entire new covers with metal gears, but would prefer to fix it myself (yeah, $10 isn't that much to buy one, but it would also be fun to fix for me, I just don't know where to get the gears from).  I tried to search for places that sell gears, but feel pretty lost in this area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that this is a slightly ridiculous question because a used Whirly-Pop can be purchased for under $5 (although you need to search around thrift stores or estate sales to find one for this price).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also understand that using a hot air popper is probably a better idea and also not very expensive, and that further getting a real roaster isn't super expensive and will probably get one eventually.  I enjoy roasting coffee on a grill outside using a manual popcorn popper.  I have gotten great results doing this, so am hoping someone may already have a solution to this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Don't think you can replace only the gears, but I found lots of places selling replacement lids with heavy duty gears.  Check the link out below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.whirleypopshop.com/40052.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;WhirleyPopShop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I googled 'metal gears for whirley pop' and got a ton of options.  By the way, it appears that the gearing on the lid in the link above is held together by allen wrench tap screws so you 'might' be able to scavenge the gears off the lid and put them on your own, although, if the lid itself works well, then I don't see why you would want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast blends are simply coffees which are blended to present a particular flavor.  Typically breakfast blends are lighter, and cleaner which are appetizing as a morning drink as opposed to a heavier, darker blend.  Honestly, there's no reason why this is a 'breakfast' blend, other than it has become pseudo-standardized by so many roasteries using the name connected with this style of blend.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Which nespresso capsule has the most caffeine in it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just got a Krups Nespresso capsules machine. I tried many capsules that come with the product as a demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I liked almost all of the flavors. However, I need a capsule that has the highest level of caffeine in it. I tried Kaazar, like it very much, but I believe there are other capsules that deliver more caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help :)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;So.. I've done a lot of research on caffeine levels or at least reading various books that skirt the topic.  Interestingly, the caffeine amount in a particular roast is slightly different than most peoples conceptions, including my own up until a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, caffeine levels in dark vs light roasts are often said to be different.  From a chemical perspective caffeine is chemically stable to 455 degrees Fahrenheit (it's melting point).  Due to this, caffeine is not removed during the roasting process unless you are roasting to a Spanish roast, or burned beyond all recognition.  As such, the caffeine inherit in a particular lot of green coffee tends to stay the same amount per bean regardless of roast depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The twist..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roasting will roughly double bean size, and burn off between 12 and 18% of the total weight of a bean.  Due to this, technically, a darker roast has more caffeine by weight than a lighter roast, which is opposite of what I hear a lot of people say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now.. on to your question.. If the pods are by weight, I suppose a dark roast will have marginally more caffeine.  Where you get a significant difference in caffeine amounts is when you start looking at different types of coffee.  Robusta coffees for instance tend to be low grown and have adapted to the environment by having higher concentrations of caffeine.  The reason is simply that caffeine is the coffee plants natural pesticide.  That being said, Robusta coffees also tend to be very bitter, hence why they are predominantly used in cheap coffee blends in place of arabica.  The bitterness is directly related to the elevated caffeine, as well as very high concentrations of CGA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation is pick what tastes good, because honestly, you aren't going to get a significantly higher amount of caffeine per roast, or lot of beans.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are good brewing practices?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know how to improve my brewing practices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make my daily cup out of a drip brew machine, but I find inconsistency in my flavours every time. I get my beans ground from a local shop and they tend to lose their potency after one week and seem little stale and bitter. 
What should I do in order to get a consistent cup every time?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The problem doesn't seem to be in your brewing practices but in the way you store your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roasted coffee starts to stale soon after the resting/degassing period ends. Ideally you ought to store your coffee in a vacuum-sealed container that won’t impart unwanted flavors to your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placing your coffee into the fridge, as many people do, isn't usually a good idea. The fridge is not cold enough to keep the coffee fresh and the coffee will absorbs odors and moisture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One solution, in addition to better sealing your coffee, would be to buy whole beans and grind your coffee before you use it instead of grinding a week's worth of coffee at one time.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee passing through filter during bloom</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been making pour over coffee now for about 1 year. I enjoy it. I hand grind the beans with a burr grinder and select a medium-fine grind. What I find though is that during the bloom time (about 45 seconds), about 1 ounce of coffee filters through. Is that normal and expected, or is that too much coffee to be filtering through during the bloom time? Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The drip-through of water during the bloom process isn't itself a cause for worry of a 'bad' brew as this process is meant to aid degassing of the beans prior to the main brew pour. The amount of drip-through you're experiencing is completely fine as long as the entire bed of coffee has been wet by the bloom pour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you reckon there is too much coming through, make sure you're not using too much water relative to your total brew weight in the bloom. If a significant fraction of your water is used during the bloom, and therefore less being used during actual extraction, it will affect the resulting flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd argue that as long as the amount of water used for the bloom is less than 1/4 of the total brew water weight and the entire bed is being wet by it, no matter how much filters through, it should not affect the brew significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to transport coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid this is a dirty &lt;em&gt;instant coffee&lt;/em&gt; question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every morning I'm up pretty early and will usually make myself a quick instant coffee in a travel mug and hit the road. It is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good instant coffee, IMHO, and not only keeps me going for most of the morning but is also very tasty. But usually just after lunch I'm hankering for another, and herein the problem lies: most of the office are tea drinkers, and the options for coffee are limited to one &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt; instant variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wouldn't really be acceptable for me to bring in a jar of coffee (I know this would be fine in some places but I wouldn't feel comfortable with it in my workplace culture) so what I'd like to do is bring in a mix of my coffee contents to use in a one-off way. I take my coffee with two spoons instant coffee, three spoons sugar and about 40ml milk or so (it's quite a big mug), and would love a way to transport this concoction to the office daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally I would create a little sachet with all the ingredients inside but that doesn't seem like something I'd be able to do. I've also considered bringing it in in a tupperware or some other airtight container, but I think I'd struggle to transfer it all properly from the container to the mug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any coffee transporting solutions where I could somehow bring in all the ingredients I need, mess free, in my backpack?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Actually, I will change the direction to ground coffee. A few months ago, I have seen a nice solution for campers. I took a photo of it for reference at that time. It seems quite useful to me. However, I mostly prepare my 'tasty' coffee at home and drink 'crap' coffee in the office. So it didn't fit me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, here is the invention. A camping style brewer pack. You will need just the hot water in the office. Each pack is single use only. It was just a bit more than regular price. But it was still affordable. Still, you may not like to use this in daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Understanding Coffee Bean names as they relate to roast</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So for example, in my local Fairway Market, I see barrels of coffee beans labeled such as "Ethiopian Harrar", "Costa Rica Tarrazu", "Ethiopia Yirgacheffe" etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These names literally refer to geographic locations in a country, where the beans are grown and harvested (I assume). How do these names relate to roast level of the different beans? Is there a standard? Does "Ethiopian Harrar" for example imply a particular roast level that is consistent no matter who you buy the beans from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(What are origin characteristics? The answer is at the end.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to check the details what happens during roasting, you may check the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Maillard reaction&lt;/a&gt; in one of the previous posts:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it safe to say that same type of coffee used with an espresso machine is ideal for a moka pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;As far as the type of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;proper grind-size goes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...do you treat a moka pot's coffee (bean/roast/grind) the same way as a full espresso machine? I use a Bialetti Brikka - which makes a great shot, &amp;amp; even approximates a "crema" (though I know it isn't actually the same "crema" as with an espresso machine) and I always thought this moka pot is like having an espresso machine on your stovetop. So naturally, I would buy stronger Coffea Arabica varieties, roasted dark, but would only grind them to a medium/fine to suit the basket filter. But as far as bean &amp;amp; roast, I would match what most espresso machines use. Am I wrong to match this moka pot's bean preference to that of an espresso machine? Are they better utilized using completely different bean cocktails?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help would be most appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UGxME.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;First, let's clear the misconception. The posted photo in the question is a moka pot. This is a common misconception all around the globe and also discussed in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Coffee SE&lt;/a&gt; a few times.

&lt;p&gt;Then, please check this answer regarding the crema and the pressure issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enormous Editing&lt;/strong&gt; after farankoshan's change in the question is below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we decide to compare the moka pot (instead of a percolator) with espresso, then my answer is as follows. I keep the first version for history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the grind size is very different. It is advised that ideal grind size for espresso is around &lt;strong&gt;300 µ&lt;/strong&gt; where for a moka pot it is around &lt;strong&gt;800 µ&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also known that espresso brews are the most acidic cups and moka pots are produce generally bitter cups. A reference to espresso brews is below, unfortunately, this study does not include moka pots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/349/could-preparation-method-make-coffee-more-acidic/"&gt;Could preparation method make coffee more acidic?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this knowledge, you may decide your beans and roast as you please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the roast, it is known that acidity reduces when roast degree increases. That's why many espresso brews are prepared with darker roasts. You may search for your taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the bean origin (or the blend) you may again search for the specific acidity and bitterness. JayCo's previous study below is a good starting point again.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;MT San talks about portafilters and the resulting differences between these portafilters that are different in size. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will discuss the differences in espresso extraction as a result of portafilter and subsequent basket size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the only variable here is basket diameter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientifically, pressure applied is normally measured as force per unit surface area. Taking the bed of coffee as a flat surface, and we assume traditional extraction pressure of 8 bar, the net extraction force upon the coffee puck will be greater for larger surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 bar = 800kPa = 800 kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now given two different basket sizes 58mm and 52mm which are 0.058m and 0.052m respectively, the net force on the surface of bed of coffee will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For 58mm:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surface area: ?r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ?*0.029&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.00264207942&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net force on area: pressure x area = 800*0.00264 = 2.11 kN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For 52mm:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surface area: ?r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ?*0.026&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.00212371663&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net force on area: pressure x area = 800*0.00212 = 1.7 kN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that the larger portafilter is subject to a higher force of extraction with the same pressure. What this amounts to in practice is very much dependent on your setup. However it should tend towards better consistency in extraction. This is because, for a given dose, more of the coffee is in contact with the water at the bed surface and so has a more direct pressure gradient through the puck as it will be comparatively thin in the larger basket helping to reduce probability of channeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, observable effects in practice will be slight to none as many other variables will take precedence in affecting shot flavour and the difference in extraction force will be accounted for silently in your dial-in process.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the difference between the coffee brew from a moka pot and percolator?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I don't drink coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BEAR WITH ME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I enjoy making coffee for other people.&lt;br&gt;
Could you please describe the differences between the brews from a moka pot and a percolator?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is sort of like describing a painting to a blind man but I can only choose to get one of the two and I would like to know what the taste and feel of each brew is before I make my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, no, I don't drink coffee, because I can't stand coffee, so tasting isn't an option. :)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In a stove top coffee maker the water is boiled in the lower chamber, the steam pushes the water at low pressure upwards through the grounds before reaching the upper chamber, let's call it decanter. So the water is in contact with the grounds only once. Due to the high temperature there is arguably over extraction happening. In terms of flavor you can tell by the slightly bitter taste. Another factor contributing to this is that the fines are flushed out with the water, ending up in the decanter and your cup where they keep extracting bitter compounds. This can be minimized using some tweaks, but it's not preventable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A percolator in comparison keeps circulating the water and brewed coffee through the grounds, reaching an even higher extraction ratio. The water and continuously the brewed coffee is heated, pushed upwards and "dropped" on the grounds before it sinks down towards the heat source again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference in taste stems from the rules of extraction. The first substances to be extracted are caffein and acids. Caffein is bitter, but adds only partly to the bitterness in coffee compared to other compounds extracted later. The acids give coffee fruitiness, which is usually a desired quality and forms the base of the taste profile. The bitter compounds and sugars are extracted last. You want mainly the sugars in your cup to add sweetness, the bitter compounds you want to avoid. They make the coffee taste hollow, ashy, a bit like charcoal or burned rubber and leaves you with a kind of empty feeling after swallowing it. By that I mean it has no pleasant lingering after taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically that is what's happening with percolators. They over extract, meaning too many of the bitter compounds get in your coffee, which makes it unbalanced and just overall not really tasty. I would say it's probably one of the worst methods out there to make coffee nowadays in terms of extraction. There is of course a subjective component to it. Some people might enjoy exactly this taste. Maybe they want that burned taste, then add lots of sugar, milk and/or flavors and that's just what they like. That's of course ok, but the facts remain, that you lose complexity, fruitiness and sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is coffee bad for my heart?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;For most healthy people, caffeine could cause a short, temporary increase in blood pressure. If you don't have high blood pressure you can still feel your heart race after your morning cup. Avid coffee drinkers can build up a tolerance to the caffeine and may not experience effects after a cup. So is it true that coffee is bad for the heart? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If someone already have a heart condition, probably she should ask such questions to her physician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it's noted in the question itself, it's a known fact that caffeine may increase blood pressure temporarily. If someone is on the edge of an hearth attack, coffee may trigger this (by increasing the blood pressure). As well as, running after your grandson or arguing hot on some topic could trigger, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, under normal circumstances, a temporary blood pressure increase should not be a problem for your health if you're a healthy person. However, we are not M.D.'s here, so, please go ask a physician first if you have doubts. Drink decaf if you feel safer.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Difference between steam wand and aeroccino frother</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I often use an &lt;em&gt;Aeroccino&lt;/em&gt; automatic milk frother that comes with some Nespresso machines. It froths milk by whisking it rapidly in a heated cup and produces a rather pleasant foam, though the resulting taste and texture is noticeably different from what I usually get at commercial coffee places. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know whether it's mostly due to some difference in the froth or the fact that I'm not using actual espresso (I use either a Nespresso machine or an Aeropress depending on where I am at the moment). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the froth does seem different, but what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the difference, precisely? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Another difference is that the Aerocinno tends to produce firmer and longer-lasting froth compared to a wand. It's designed to provide a one-size-fits-all solution for consumers accustomed to automatic machines, whereas a milk wand requires more skill to use but allows for a lot more customization. Think of it like an automatic vs manual transmission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the type of milk you use can also make a difference. Keep this in mind when comparing the two. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does drinking coffee immediately after lunch or dinner impact health?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Does drinking coffee immediately after breakfast or lunch or dinner impact health? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think this is a rather broad question to answer. Are you looking for overall health effects of coffee or specifically for effects on digestion after eating?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the former case, recent research has delivered very strong evidence that drinking a moderate amount of coffee (about 3 cups a day) has strong positive health benefits, reducing premature mortality quite dramatically. Among others coffee likely has positive effects on cardiovascular diseases, can be preventative to some types of cancer and alzheimer diseases and has positive effects on diabetes. See for example &lt;a href="http://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2643435/coffee-drinking-mortality-10-european-countries-multinational-cohort-study" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.j5024" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2643433/association-coffee-consumption-total-cause-specific-mortality-among-nonwhite-populations" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter case is less conclusive I think. There have been studies showing that coffee (the chlorogenic acid in it) reduces glucose intake from digestion. While a decrease in nutrient intake seems like a bad thing at first glance, it may be beneficial for patients of diabetes, because it regulates glucose intake after meals and may help in preventing spikes/drops in insulin levels. I guess for someone struggling to get enough nutrients (due to other digestive diseases for example) excessive coffee consumption could have adverse effects. For healthy people moderate amounts most likely don't have negative effects (see the linked studies). There's also some evidence that coffee has beneficial effects on your microbial composition in your intestines (see &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160509000166" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's some other less severe potential issues that might arise, like an increase in reflux symptoms, due to excessive production of stomach acid (however dark roasts of coffee might even have acid reducing effects).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So overall I'd argue that the potential health benefits by far outweigh negative effects, except maybe in some cases of pre-existing conditions such as diseases of stomach and/or intestines.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>I like a really mild tasting coffee, not to bitter, a little bit sweet but not overly sweet, what beans have this kind of flavour</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My dad has a coffee bean roaster, so he buys green beans and roasts them himself , he really likes his coffee beans to have a strong flavour. I would like to find a green beans that are more mild in flavour, if it helps I drink my coffee as a latte. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to be specific with my question. What region of the world produces coffee beans with a mild flavour, or even if u know an exact farm that produces mild tasting beans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, I’m looking forward to your suggestions  &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think your question may need a bit of disentangling, however I will try and deal with your main points. First there are several factors that influence coffee bitterness, and origin, albeit important is not the most influential factor. More on that later. Secondly it is not clear what you mean with "mild" coffee. Do you just mean "not bitter"? Because non bitter coffee is by no means necessarily mild. It can even be more flavorful with very fruity flavors and a lot of acidity, while bitterness may cover up a lot of these flavors.
Regardless of that I will now write some points about how to reduce bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arabica tends to be lower in bitterness and astringency than Robusta, because Robusta contains more caffeine and chlorogenic acids. So take care you buy 100% Arabica.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The roasting is a very important factor. Dark roasts are much more bitter than light roasts, while lighter roasts emphasize floral, fruity flavors and acidity. In my opinion most people who complain about bitterness in coffee could fix that by drinking lighter roasts. Unfortunately for most people roasted coffee has to look dark brown to almost black with a glossy surface. In most cases beans like that are over roasted. So  you may want to try your dads beans with a different roast profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you prepare your coffee? Bitterness is often a result of over extraction. Make sure you extract your coffee properly so you get a flavorful, but delicate and pleasant taste. You will find instructions for your preferred preparation method here on the stack exchange, on many websites of specialty coffee shops or you could ask in your favorite specialty coffee shop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last but not least, origin can play a role in bitterness. Overall you could probably say (all else equal) that many african coffees are lower in bitterness and higher in acidity. You could try Ethiopian and Kenyan coffees. Ethiopian coffees tend do be very delicate, floral with nice acidity while Kenyan coffees are higher in acidity and fruitiness. Central or South American coffees are probably (all else equal) slightly more bitter, but if the roast and extraction is right, bitterness also shouldn't be an issue. They would have more nutty, chocolaty flavors. Of course there's exceptions. Panama Geishas would be relatively high in acidity compared to other Central American coffees (also much more expensive and the bean is originally an Ethiopian heirloom variety).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum it up though I would recommend you first focus on point one to three. In my opinion they are more influential here. I'm assuming that you are already using Arabica, but I suggest to try different roast profiles and recipes. If you already did that I would recommend you to buy some washed Ethiopian beans as they produce delicate (you could maybe call them "mild" although I don't think it's the appropriate term) cups.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Pouring lungo into two cups</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a quick question.
I know that lungo is less concentrated than a regular shot of espresso, so if I pour a lungo into two cups at the same time, as I guess most machines would let me do, will I get the equivalent of pouring two separate espresso shots, or will I just get a weaker tasting espresso in each cup?
Should I instead use a double lungo for this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A lungo is an espresso that is pulled for longer and thus more water flows through the grounds. Plainly speaking it's just a bad way to dilute espresso, because you are extracting more of the bitter compounds that you don't actually want to have in the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to fill two cups at the same time, you'll have to use a double basket (with two spouts), which means that you will also pull a double shot automatically. Using the double basket means that you also need double the amount of coffee as compared to a single basket (with one spout).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So pulling with a double basket will give you two separate lungo shots, one in each cup. If you put a large cup under both spouts you will get a double lungo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The better way to dilute espresso is to fill the cup with water (to your taste and strength preference) and pull a regular shot in the cup with water already in it in order to make an americano.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I know if my aeropress is too loose?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I bought my wife an aeropress for Christmas and I used it a few times before understanding exactly what the instructions were saying - (I tried to make a latte with hot milk and water in the hopper) it was very hard to press down at that point - I've never tried doing that again, but I think since then it's been a little too easy to press down the plunger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should it actually take 10-60 seconds to press down all the water given the pressure from above? It seems like almost all the water (up to #2) is through the filter by the time I get half way down the thing and the last half of pressing gets easier, not harder as you might expect with more pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;How easy it is to push the aeropress plunger depends mostly on how coarse or fine your coffee is ground. It sounds like your grind might be too coarse, a finer grind will make it "less loose". A medium-fine or filter coffee grind will usually work best in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As another answer explained, don't put milk into the aeropress, it won't filter properly. You can add milk to the cup afterwards if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 20 seconds to push the coffee through the aeropress with light to moderate pressure (just leaning on the plunger) would be a good time. Your description of the water passing easily at first and the plunger being "too loose" sound like your coffee grind is too coarse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an excellent &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/P0N6ygb1Ypg?t=640" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; showing how to use an aeropress brewer by expert baristo, Tim Wendelboe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The site design here won't let me edit or post a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study you found found an adverse effect &lt;em&gt;in animals&lt;/em&gt; with an exceptionally high intake of caffeine. 25 mg/kg would equate to &gt; 2,000 mg for an average adult (U.S. average, 82 kg) which is a huge amount of caffeine, about &lt;em&gt;five times&lt;/em&gt; the maximum amount that is generally recognized as safe (GRAS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animal data does not always transfer well to human situations. And we have two statistically controlled major studies that are at some odds with the McGill findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings are interesting but they only suggest areas that merit more research. It is far from certain that the results would be accurate for humans. And even if you were to make that assumption, the only datum that you really have is that people who ingest huge amounts of caffeine, many fold above GRAS may have a slow recovery from acute hearing trauma or tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How does water level affect steam?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The water heated in a metal boiler is kept mid-way, to create enough space for steam. The steam is used to heat milk and froth it. My question is, how does the level of water -- higher, lower, middle vertically inside the boiler -- affect the quality of steam?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Boiler water level has a significant effect on steam capacity and temperature stability. It may also impact steam quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three steam characteristics to look at: the amount of steam available, steam power, which is pressure but it's easier to visualize this as &lt;em&gt;velocity&lt;/em&gt; and quality. High quality steam should be dry and saturated, not wet. Within the safe (design) operating range of water level for your boiler, a lower water level means that there is more &lt;em&gt;headspace&lt;/em&gt; or space for the steam. This means that you will have a larger supply of steam, higher quality (drier) steam and better temperature stability because it's easier to heat a volume of steam than the same physical volume of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A higher water level will reduce the effective amount of steam available and tend to create wet steam as more water gets entrained into the steam. Conversely if your machine sees heavy use for espresso but not steam, you may benefit from a somewhat higher water level which favours water temperature stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intended water level serves several masters as a espresso machine requires water and steam and of course safety, cost, stability and steam quality in an usable balance. On a single boiler machine you can't really increase the boiler pressure to increase steam power because it would make the machine run too hot for quality espresso extraction. In general, it is desirable to operate single boiler machines on the lower end of the safe water level range for better steaming ability.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However if you have a consumer machine with an inadequately small boiler you may find that lower water levels produce an apparently anemic steam jet. The proper fix for this would be a larger, more capable boiler but pragmatically a higher water level will then produce a more usable steam flow because the entrained water in wet steam has more inertia or &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; at the expense of less steam capacity and lower quality steam. Or to put it another way in a machine that has too small of a boiler you may need to keep the water level higher to get enough steam power but it will also degrade the steam quality and will make texturing milk more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>How could I improve extraction and yield more coffee when brewing with a filter?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;By my estimate 1 pound of course ground coffee leaves about 900 grams of concentrate in the wet grounds after filtering.&lt;br&gt;
In a perfect world with 100% extraction we could get about 54 cups of coffee from a pound of coffee. Using a drip filter I only get 28 cups.
Using a modified salad spinner I retrieved about 142g more per pound or enough concentrate to make about 4 cups of coffee which is an increased yield of about 13%.
Has anyone found other methods of retrieving the wasted concentrate? I'm thinking something like a press or high speed centrifugal filter. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;We need more information to give you good answers. The current question is rather vague and open-ended. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your end goal brewed coffee or concentrate? For yourself or as a commercial product? Is quality (taste) a primary consideration or are you concentrating on yield and/or caffeine and don't care much about taste? You should also describe your brew method in detail, tell us how you are grinding your coffee, how much coffee and water you use (brew ratio) and if you measure it, TDS (total dissolved solids).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are almost certain to degrade quality if you press or "spin" your grounds to increase yield. If you proceed anyway, a centrifuge is more likely to both produce a better product and maximize yield. Pressing grounds will over-extract and create a bitter result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might want to consider brewing espresso, rather than coffee if yield is important. Better quality espresso machines will have quite dry pucks (grounds) and you have the advantage of a concentrated product, if that is a goal. Otherwise you can just add hot water to make an &lt;em&gt;Americano&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Long black&lt;/em&gt; which is an end product quite similar to brewed coffee but with the higher yield you desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that taste is important and it is to some degree for most people, then you have to consider the detrimental effect that pressing or centrifuging wet grounds will have on taste. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Additions to decaff coffee to complement taste</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm alternating drinking decaf bean coffee (O2 process) alongside caffeinated beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I drink caffeinated either black or with a little milk.
With decaf, the reduced body of the taste is noticeable, and if I've drunk a few decafs I find the persisting aftertaste not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What additives do people add to decaf to complement its flavour, if any?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It is complicated. You may try adding cream, milk, salt (for masking up the aftertaste), but I don't recall any barista adding any other stuff for improving the decaf taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will hardly get it as good as a regular caffeinated coffee. The point is that the roasteries are often neglecting any improvements in their decaffeination process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, what worked out was checking any local roasteries which would actually perform the method called "Swiss Water Process" for decaf. This one is quite ok for a lot of people, and if your local roastery is committed to doing it right, then it is all good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, have you tried any different brewing method? &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Could you list healthy, unsweetened coffee flavouring syrups?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Most of the coffee syrups sold by big chain cafes are either traditionally sweetened or artificially sweetened.  However, the flavoured coffee they have "on tap" are completely unsweetened, which is what I seek.  I've done some initial web scouting for syrups, but it's not always easy to ferrut out a complete ingredients list.  Though I have come across lists such as "other ingredients" below the nutrition table.  Not too sure how to interpret that, as I do not view the nutritional table as an ingredients list at all.  Many syrups are general-purpose rather than being meant for coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than continue running down what seems like a high ratio of information dead ends, I'm hoping to leverage the awareness of those who already enjoy healthy coffee flavouring syrups that are completely unsweetened.  Even slightly sweetened would be fine, as long as it doesn't consist of recently developed     alternative sweeteners, even of the all-natural variety (I want to avoid accusations of slagging products by mentioning names).  &lt;strong&gt;If you are able to divulge what your syrup is, I'd appreciate it.&lt;/strong&gt;  If you can provide the ingredients and/or nutritional info, either as text, photos, or URLs, so much the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my attempts to inquire about suitable syrups in decades past, I suspect and hope that there are few candidate options that (i) are targeted to coffee; (ii) are completely (or almost completely) unsweetened; and (iii) have their ingredients (and maybe the nutrition) list available online.  If so, then this question is not nearly as open-ended as it may seem at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The brand &lt;a href="https://www.zavida.com/minisyrup/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;MiniSyrup&lt;/a&gt; seems to meet your requirements. From their website,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;SUGAR/SWEETENER/CALORIE FREE. Unlike the big bottles of syrup that are crammed with sugar or artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame, MiniSyrup Flavor Shots are the first completely unsweetened flavoring made to flavor your favorite beverages like brewed coffee, hot chocolate, lattes, fountain sodas, tea and more. This gives you complete control over not only the flavor in your beverage, but also your sweetness. &lt;a href="https://www.zavida.com/minisyrup/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don't seem to have nutrition information on their website, but &lt;a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/mini-syrup-french-vanilla-unsweetened-138065505" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;myfitnesspal lists the nutrition information&lt;/a&gt; for some of their flavors. I'm not sure of the validity, but as you mentioned in a comment you can reach out to MiniSyrup for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>My cafe roma machine doesn't provide enough pressure to push water through the finest setting of my grinder</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've had to turn the setting down on my grinder, but I know the espresso isn't as good. It's not as rich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When i put it on the highest setting, the espresso drips out, one drip a second, and that tastes like proper espresso, but its way too slow and I'm worried the machine is going to break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to try and fix the machine? Is it possible my machine is simply too cheap to make proper espresso? (FYI I recently decalcified the machine and that didn't help much.)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Delonghi Magnifica - pump stops after 10 seconds with fault lights</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My Delonghi Magnifica ECAM22.110.B Bean-to-Cup machine just stopped working. The symptoms are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine starts as normal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grinder runs and pump runs for exactly 10 seconds then cuts out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water from steam nozzle also runs for exactly 10 seconds and then cuts out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the machine, the "water" light is illuminated and the "fault" and "grounds" lights are flashing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Given that this fault showed with hot water from the steam nozzle, I was guessing a pump or flow sensor fault. It turned out to be the flow sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To repair:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unplug the coffee machine from the mains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the back panel, see &lt;a href="https://fr.ifixit.com/Guide/DeLonghi+ESAM+3000.B+Magnifica+Open/98952?lang=en" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locate the flow sensor:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/phuOl.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/phuOl.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unplug the electrical connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disconnect the two tubes (noting which goes where)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the flow sensor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully twist the top and bottom to open it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rinse to remove any particles - mine had some coffee grounds in it which were probably jamming the mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully reassemble the sensor and reattach it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the covers&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Is leaving coffee bins open in the store normal?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm checking out a local coffee shop online that was recommended to me, before deciding to go in. I noticed that the beans they sell in bins are all uncovered in photos (the photos are from Google so they're most likely taken by customers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this normal for coffee shops to leave beans exposed to air like that? I was under the impression that air exposure directly affects flavour. The place has fantastic reviews and a few people told me about it IRL, so it seemed odd that they wouldn't follow what I would think is standard procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, it is not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may see in many other answers in this SE, Coffee SE site's answers will lead you that coffee is best stored when it's distant from air,  odor and light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closed, vacuumed storage is the regular way and coffee stores are no exception. On the other hand, one may expect that a store should grind coffee when it needs it. So, it won't go stale unnecessarily. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How should I manage settings for single shot / double shot</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just bought a Nuova Simonelli Musica + Eureka Mignon, so I'm practicing extracting a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually use single shot portfilter, as I am at home, and I live alone, so I don't want to waste too much coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I adjust grinder level, coffee quantity, and tamper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I put a double shot portfilter, I must change all my settings, because coffee is to thin, and water will not go through coffee ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to manage both single and double shots with the same configuration ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, how should I manage multi configuration ??? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After careful configuration, your settings should work for both occasions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason to have a thin pellet (cake) when you fill your double basket with a single shot amount of grounds is, the area of the double basket is set to hold twice as much grounds of a single shot basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason behind that is the Darcy equation which defines the filtering properties based on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;area &lt;em&gt;(constant in both baskets)&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;viscosity &lt;em&gt;(constant for water)&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;filtration velocity &lt;em&gt;(constant, if we assume you have constant pressure)&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;filtration permeability &lt;em&gt;(we'll come to that later)&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and the thickness of the pellet &lt;em&gt;(we'll come to that later)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, non-constants in this equation are the thickness of your pellet and the filtration permeability. Let's consider permeability first. Kozeny&amp;amp;Carman equation defines this for porous medium. I can say, in short, reliable grind size defines this. Therefore, if you are ensured that you have homogeneously ground coffee and tamp them with equal force (say 15 kg-f), you can safely assume permeability as constant, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the last one: thickness of the pellet. Please see the below photograph I have taken, first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gro7r.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gro7r.jpg" alt="single and double spout portafilters"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you see, the single spout portafilter has less space and the water flows from a narrower set of holes to keep the thickness constant. When you fill the double spout portafilter, the water flows uniformly and the thickness will still be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all you need to do is setting your grinder to single shot amount (7-9 grams). Then, using single or double portafilter according to your needs. When you need a single shot, fill your portafilter with a single shot amount of coffee. Filling your double portafilter with double the amount ends up a doppio or two espressos in two cups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee mixes eggs</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;IF you have heard the expression Many Roads to Rome, the same expression applies to enjoying coffee. Yes, there are many ways to enjoy a cup of fragrant and delicious coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially for the people of Aceh, drinking coffee has become part of an inseparable lifestyle. You want to taste Acehnese filtered coffee or sanger (coffee mixed milk), or espresso, everything is there. In fact, because of the large number of coffee shops in Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh Province was dubbed the Thousand State Coffee Shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to those already mentioned above, there are other ways to enjoy coffee by mixing it with eggs. Eggs that are used are not eggs, but chicken eggs are believed to be beneficial for health. In addition to coffee shops, this concoction is usually sold in places where traditional herbal medicine is sold on the roadside. This whipped egg mixed with coffee is said to increase vitality. Hm ... really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is drinking coffee mixed with eggs harmful to health?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gGgZJ.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gGgZJ.jpg" alt="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gGgZJ.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aceh, an area also known as one of Nusantara's best coffee barns, has an enticing coffee variant. Even coffee shops in Aceh are never empty of visitors, presenting various forms of coffee creation for the audience. For the people of Aceh, drinking coffee is not only daily traditions. Drinking coffee can also increase stamina, or the people of Aceh often call it poding. The true coding is coffee mixed with eggs. Coffee and eggs are dishes that come from a mixture of coffee after filtering the pulp and mixing the eggs.
Although it has been mixed with eggs, the aroma of the coffee still feels, and does not smell fishy. To get rid of fishy odors, the eggs that have been shaken use a mixer and then soaked in hot water. Then given a mixture of coffee and a little sweetened condensed milk&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think we can assume it's as safe as drinking eggnog. (eggnog a drink made from raw eggs, milk, spices and sometimes alcohol)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the "level of safety" depends on which country you take the egg from. In some countries, eating an egg raw is safe, but in other countries it's not (like in Canada and United-States)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I GUESS you wouldn't get sick if you drink it once, but if you get the habit of drinking it often, the chance of getting sick gets higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you drink it, please tell us if it's good! :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>3rd party filters with Kalita Wave or Hario V60</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been using an Osaka stainless steel dripper for about a year now, and I think the mesh is clogged beyond repair. This results in a very slow, very cold cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am thinking of upgrading to something that uses a paper filter. Both the Hario V60 01 and Kalita Wave 155 look great to me. However, I'd prefer to use unbleached compostable filters (possibly &lt;em&gt;If You Care&lt;/em&gt; brand), but I have not found any info online regarding this kind of filter in these drippers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anybody have experience or tips for using a 3rd party paper filter? What size/shape filter is best? The "specialty" 1st party ones are pricy and typically bleached so they can not be put into the compost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Just wanted to edit and say that I have been using cloth filters for the past year from Coffee Sock brand. They work very well, so if anyone stumbles upon this question looking for a similar answer I would recommend something like Coffee Sock.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Fine-grind French Press - Sacrilege? Better method?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm a longtime French press user but I've been grinding my beans finely for a few years. Espresso-fine I guess. Ground to a powder really. I much prefer the richer, more buttery, oily cup to the thinner and lighter cup you get from the prescribed coarse grind. Yes, there's always some grit at the bottom of my cup, but I'm totally fine to toss the last ounce or two of my mug for what ends up being a delicious cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering two things:
- if there's an additional filter or tweak I could make to my setup to minimize the grit and save those last could ounces
- or if what I'm doing, brewing finely ground coffee in a French press, is sacrilege and I should really find a more appropriate brewing method such as a moka or whatever else. Again, I much prefer the consistency and oily feel of unfiltered coffee to any pourover I've ever had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appreciate your insight!
JLR&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I just want to preface by saying that while product recommendations are frowned upon here in general, there is a certain necessity in a stack like this where brew methods are often tightly related to brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple options here, the first being modifying your french press a bit and the second being a different brewer that may be easier for attaining your goal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As B540Glenn mentioned, you can try cutting our a paper filter into a circle and putting it next to the mesh filter in your french press. This will get rid of a lot of the grittiness and a little bit of the oiliness but will keep your big body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second option is to try out a Clever Dripper. It combines what you seem to like about immersion brewing and combines it with a paper filter that drains into your mug when you're ready. It's a simpler and faster way of achieving what probably is a similar result to the french press with paper filter method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are some proven effective ways to set up a subscription program for one's coffee business?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My wife and I own a coffee roasting company and we would like to up our coffee sales game by promoting a subscription program, whereby our customers would sign up to receive coffee from us on a monthly or even bi-weekly basis.  Does anyone on here have experience, or know someone who has experience setting up something like this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I don't have experience with subscription programs, but I have looked at such programs. I think the following points should be addressed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freshness&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a major selling point. If your deliveries are roasted over a month ago (or even less if you're doing (bi-)weekly deliveries), you lose a lot of the appeal. Why would customers bind themselves to your program if they can get as fresh to-order?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliability&lt;/strong&gt;. Especially when you're doing more frequent deliveries (biweekly or even weekly) customers will rely on your delivery. That is, if I expect a delivery on Saturday, I won't stock other fresh coffee for the days after. So if your delivery runs late, I might run out (which is exactly what your subscription program should prevent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;. It has to be reasonably good value. In particular, you don't want to spend too much on shipping, as that means customers aren't getting good value for money. Obviously, as volumes per shipment get bigger this becomes less of an issue and as your programs serves a lot of customers you might get a better deal with the delivery companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of delivery&lt;/strong&gt;. What I mean here is that the delivery should take little effort on the customer-end. For example, when I order beans they'll be delivered by someone ringing the door bell (because it's a big box), when I'm not home, they'll deliver to the neighbours or take it back. When you're sending small packages, make sure you customers don't need to be home, make sure it fits in / through the mailbox. That way, it will be there when they get home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment&lt;/strong&gt;. You probably want to offer a range of options. Some customers prefer to have a recurring payment that doesn't require them to authorise it for individual deliveries. Others like to pay per delivery or use pre-paid. Depending on payment options available in your country, you can offer a range of options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Is there a name for this drink?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The way I drink my espresso lately is a double shot with a small amount of steamed or heated milk and a couple of oz of hot water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not at home, I order a cappuccino with the added water and it works out pretty well. I've tried ordering an Americano with steamed milk, but they usually dilute it way too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a name for this drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm braced for lots of judgement by the aficionados. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This sounds &lt;strong&gt;Cortado&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Noisette&lt;/strong&gt; to me. Still, additional water makes it a bit interesting. I assume you may simply order your coffee based on lungo instead of doppio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, lungo based Cappucino Scuro may be another alternative. However, it also has foam on top of steamed milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This answer includes so much terminology. So, let me make a glossary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Espresso:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 ml shot of beverage made with 8 grams of beans out of espresso machine. Our main unit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doppio:&lt;/strong&gt; 60 ml of beverage made with 16 grams of beans. Double shot espresso.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lungo:&lt;/strong&gt; ~60 ml of beverage made with 8 grams of beans. Long shot single espresso.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortado:&lt;/strong&gt; A bit of steamed milk (~30 ml) is added on top of doppio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noisette:&lt;/strong&gt; A bit of hot milk (~30 ml) is added on top of doppio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cappucino:&lt;/strong&gt; A bit of steamed milk (~60 ml) then some foamed milk (~60 ml) is added on top of doppio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cappucino Scuro:&lt;/strong&gt; Same cappucino, less milk (~30 ml each). Sometimes only with foamed milk (~60 ml).&lt;/li&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Aluminum is not a very strong metal when it comes to moving parts. Probably, that small rod that keeps the handle in place is made from steel to last longer. Rust may be formed because of steam or if you don't towel dry it after washing it. No worries as it is not in contact with your beverage. I can't check mine as it's not currently with me.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why they collect coffee beans that are eaten by wild civets? Why don't they use fresh coffee beans instead of collecting these unhygienic beans.</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;How is this possible to collect coffee beans that were eaten by wild civets in forest? Is it  hygienic? Why so expensive?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The coffee bean we brew our coffee from is the seed of a fruit and the flesh of that fruit must first be removed. There are a number of industrial / cottage industry means for processing the fruit for the bean, but the civet's digestive system also does the job. :) The beans are raised well above the 140F needed to kill bacteria during the roasting process before we brew coffee from them, so no worries about the hygienics unless you're brewing green beans. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Your recommendation and advice for Turkish coffee blends</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am in a process of establishing a small coffee-factory in Egypt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to know your recommendation for Turkish-coffee-blend, what do you prefer, what are your recommendations ? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of (Brazilia-Santos 70% + Harrar 30%) , do you think is it a good combination ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I still think this is &lt;strong&gt;very subjective&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Still, some facts may help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian Santos is the most commonly used beans in Turkey for Turkish coffee. However, it is not my favorite. Other people may like it a lot. Santos is something like a mixture of many varieties, though its taste may fluctuate a lot with respect to your sources. The main reason that it is used in Turkey is the fact that it is cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethiopian Harrar, on the other hand, is one of my favorites. I don't have any concrete proofs but I believe that it was historically one of the beans used for Turkish coffee during Ottoman times, together with Yemen Typica.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Problems with latte art: too thick to draw</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm using a low-end machine with pressurized portafilter and started two weeks ago to try the latte art.
I'm aware of the basic steps and I have seen a lot of videos but no success at all drawing latte. It always get too thick to draw (that maybe is a air issue, but I even started to use a fork for better mixing it after frothing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I filmed it so maybe you guys can help me with the most critic parts. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpsjY8waL14" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Latte art video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using this milk: &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OBJmT.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OBJmT.jpg" alt="milk"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;200ml : 9.1g carbs, 7.1g proteins and 8g of fat, which 5.4g are saturated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I know I must use the right jug, but I can't find it here, already ordered online.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;From the video, I agree with the comment that you haven't made enough foam. This is probably mostly due to the small vessel you have. The proper steaming pitcher should hold about twice as much milk and foam as you'll actually use. This gives you the space to spin the milk and create lots of microfoam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you have an appropriate pitcher, follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill the pitcher&lt;/strong&gt; to about 1/4 capacity. Submerge the steam wand into the milk and turn on the steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stretch the milk&lt;/strong&gt; by drawing down the pitcher in small movements to create some foam. It should sound like the hissing of a cat or tearing paper. Stop making foam when the milk has risen to about 1/3 of the pitcher capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spin&lt;/strong&gt; the milk by holding the steam wand against the side of the pitcher. This should block off one of the jets so the other 2 or 3 jets are all directed towards the center of the pitcher. Try different angles until you find the right spot where the milk really spins in a fast vortex. The spinning will chop up the bubbles smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep spinning until the milk has come up to temperature. You can use a thermometer or touch your hand against the side of the pitcher; when it's too hot to touch, then it's ready.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smack and Swirl&lt;/strong&gt; the pitcher. Tapping the pitcher down on the table will pop any large bubbles on the surface. Swirling will loosen up the foam and allow bubbles in the middle to rise to the surface. After a few repetitions you should have a smooth glassy surface on the milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you're ready to pour. For this I'll defer to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1uL-kvq5Fg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the master&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Difference between cold brew and iced coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between cold brew and iced coffee?
Is cold brew better than iced coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Iced coffee is simply hot brewed coffee or espresso that has been poured over ice, and possibly mixed with contaminants like milk and sugar ;) 
Cold brew is coffee that has been brewed with cold water over a long period of time, usually 12-24 hours. The process eliminates a lot of the acidity in coffee, and produces a sweet, flavorful coffee when done properly. Some people like cold brew more than hot coffee, it's all just personal preference. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What coffees can I make with a briki?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a briki at home and was wondering what types of coffee can I make with it apart from Greek coffee, yack.
Anything like cappuccino/latte/americano? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Based on the &lt;a href="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzgyWDUwMA==/z/bc0AAOxy0x1TWIhp/$_3.JPG?set_id=2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;cezve shown&lt;/a&gt; by @IgorTatarnikov, I can say the options are really limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cezve presented here is an electrical Turkish coffee pot with proper quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decoction brewing technique (mixing grounds and water together, then heat them up) and their alternatives are the only ones you can do. Worse, you cannot slow down heating in an electrical pot. Actually, quick heating is something desired for good Turkish coffee. But, you cannot use this for &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3074/what-is-m%C4%B1rra-the-over-brewed-turkish-coffee"&gt;m?rra&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding flavors may be an option. Like cardamom, mastic, etc. to diversify the Turkish coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option which is rarely made in Turkey is adding milk after preparing the coffee. First, you need to wait a while for the grounds settle down. Then, pour the non-grounded part on another cup and add warm milk. It resembles &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/217/how-do-i-use-this-indian-coffee-maker"&gt;Indian coffee&lt;/a&gt;, but without sugar. And you cannot use their fancy filtering equipment. This may resemble latte a bit. But, I can't think of any other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One side note... Such an electrical pot is a cool device to quickly heat up water. So, if you also place a few more cups and grab some filters you can filter your own coffee. When I was a student, I used to use this a lot. I used a similar machine to prepare Turkish coffee at the same time I directly filter my grounds with a Melitta filter on my cup.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How coffee activates the nerve cells of the brain and what is the mechanism of it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;After drinking coffee we feel so relaxed and our brains feel so free. Why this happens?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine blocks the adenosine methabolism in the neurons which normally manages the tiredness and sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOfquPE1cnU" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here is a very nice informative video if you prefer to watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adenosine molecules are released by neurons during the day and after they reach some concentration, they activate the adenosine receptors of the neurons of our brains. This is a mechanism to stop us being extremely tired and makes us sleep regularly for daily maintenance of our body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is a very similar molecule to adenosine in the molecular scale. So, it tricks the receptors as if it is adenosine. But, it doesn't activate the sleeping procedure. So, as a result, we block our sleeping cycle by masquerading adenosine with caffeine for a while. After a while, caffeine is removed from our brain by blood flow and everything returns to normal.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is coffee addiction a problem?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;If a person drink coffee for 3 to 4 times a day like a tea and certainly have a coffee addiction. One feels headache when deprived of their coffee for even a single day. Is this a problem to have addiction of coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee addiction is not generally a problem as it is not even an addiction such that people afraid most of the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caffeine molecules increase and stay at high levels if a person is a regular drinker. During this phase, your body reacts that and adapts to handle more caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's like diving deep and staying there for some time. Then, if you rapidly swim up to the surface you caught caisson disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human body is very resilient to changing caffeine levels. It can adapt easily. But, it cannot adapt so fast. If someone is afraid of being addicted, they can slowly decrease the amount of coffee they consume per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, think of someone drinks 6 cups a day. If decrease rate is a cup per three days, after 15 days daily consumption will be a cup per day. Seems reasonable with no headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Am I psychologically addicted to coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I do not really mind if I am addicted to coffee. However, I noticed a psychological effect and that makes me kind of curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I do not drink coffee, I feel more negative about life. Caffeine really changes my mind in a positive direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can not really work without drinking coffee. After I get caffeine, I am more concentrated and this forces me to drink before I do some serious 'thinking' work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I am sick, I avoid drinking coffee. However, I am experimenting myself in these situations. After I drink coffee, I feel a better improvement in my body compared to medicine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think I should be anxious?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Studies show that caffeine withdrawal is more of a psychological than a biochemical phenomenon. For example, if we know that stopping the consumption of caffeine leads to headaches, they will happen, because waiting provokes a reaction. This, in particular, is evidenced by a review of the 2004 journal Psychopharmacology, in the preparation of which scientists analyzed more than 50 articles from medical literature on a given topic.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>When dialing in a pour over, what factors indicate a change in water temperature might be necessary?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been experimenting with my v60, EK43, refractometer and variable temperature kettle. I understand somewhat how grind size, water-to-Coffee ratio, agitation etc. affect extraction, but I am unclear on the role water temperature plays. I’ve heard 195-205 F is ideal slurry temperature, but how do I know when I might need to make a change in water temperature?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Agreed with the above answer by Jason: it's about taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, of late i have been surprised by how effective for extractin Scott Rao's 97degree C is for a pour over&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/c0Qe_ASxfNM" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;.In particular it seems that central and south american beans need the temp to get out the flavour - african's less so but still work in that range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to your question - a more specific mapping of flavours:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Perger has a super chart to map when temp may come into play based on what you're tasting and how to tweak it. (&lt;a href="https://baristahustle.com/blog/the-coffee-compass/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I make instant coffee with hot water, and wait till it gets little colder. Or I can also add a bit cold water after the hot water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, Does it make different in the taste?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It is my understanding that the bitterness comes from coffee grinds in hot water for longer period of time or in really hot water above like 160f. The longer they are in hot water the more bitter it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I would assume that leaving them in the hot water til it cools would have a more bitter taste, however I'm not clear on instant coffee, or how long it needs to steep. In fact it may be designed to work the way you use it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Merits &amp; demerits of coffee consumption</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Every now and then, there are research reports on the benefits as well as the harm of coffee consumption in the journals and the newspapers. Once, they say it is bad; then a few days later, they say it is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to rely upon?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Generally,
it's helpful when considering "resaerch" - to consider the source rather than the newspaper report of a resaerch paper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More times than not - with coffee as with just about any other topic from science explained in the media - the news is taking a high level single take away from what may be a complex study. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: if something says "coffee is bad" what's under the headline? Bad for rats when forcefed caffeine for a week and kept awake?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise for coffee, one of the best things to do if interested in the science is look for REVIEW articles, that have been carried out over the past couple years so the latest work is included - and see where the consensus is at - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other is to look at those reviews in terms of areas - so coffee consumption over X mg may be completely bad - for a particular effect - but completely fine in another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now it's difficult to find where coffee at normal levels (a few cups a day) has any real problems. and may have benefits &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance - this is a quote from a 2017 big review of studies on coffee&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696634/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696634/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conclusion Coffee consumption seems generally safe within usual levels of intake, with summary estimates indicating largest risk reduction for various health outcomes at three to four cups a day, and more likely to benefit health than harm. Robust randomised controlled trials are needed to understand whether the observed associations are causal. Importantly, outside of pregnancy, existing evidence suggests that coffee could be tested as an intervention without significant risk of causing harm. Women at increased risk of fracture should possibly be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another review from 2017 - looking at impacts on health generally writes
&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28675917" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28675917&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For adults consuming moderate amounts of coffee (3?-?4 cups/d providing 300?-?400?mg/d of caffeine), there is little evidence of health risks and some evidence of health benefits. This review provides up-to-date information about coffee on health. Topics addressed include the cardiovascular system, liver diseases, and diabetes as well as gastrointestinal disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, you can see the consensus, when looking at a variety of areas that are related to "health" suggest coffee is pretty ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you want you can look into specific correlations like coffee and different types of cancer (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=coffee+cancer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=coffee+cancer&lt;/a&gt;) - where intriguingly even here some work shows cancer cells in for instance collorectal cancer (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5386640/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5386640/&lt;/a&gt;) are inhibited by coffee - but that's if you get really intrigued with the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps empower your coffee journey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main take away: if you see an ineresting news article making a claim about science - try to follow back to the original article being referenced and check out at least the abstract, and if you can the full article - in particular the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the best

I heard everytime you use it, wash it, if that is true just rinse will do or proper wash with fairy and sponge (which sound hectic) given In office.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;For someone who works with high commercial grade espresso machines, I clean my shop's machine once a day before closing. There really isn't enough downtime in the day to deep clean the machine. For someone like yourself who might use it once or twice a day, just make sure that you always wipe it down with a damp rag and purge it a time or two for a couple seconds. If you really are concerned about it always being clean, buy some Cafiza. It'll keep your frother super clean. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Dual Hopper Grinder, Single Brewer, Mixing Flavors! Please help!</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I own a small coffee shop, and the regulars love their flavored coffee.  To help improve the workflow, I bought a dual hopper grinder.  One side is flavored, the other is regular/house.  We brew both in the same brewer, but into different pots and with different baskets, but I still get the taste of flavored in my regular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to try and prevent this, I've programmed one switch on my grinder to "purge" the flavored.  It runs a quick 1-2 second purge using regular beans through the grinder and into the flavored basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone dealt with this issue or does anyone know how to prevent them from mixing short of separate grinders and brewers?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Ignoring Krups instructions re descaling</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was given a very special Krups coffee machine that grinds and makes the coffee, for a big birthday. Can I use citric acid rather than extremely expensive Krups descaling powder?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Technically you can use whatever you want to descale a machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind the manufacturer recommends using certain things for a reason. It could be the material inside the machine are sensitive to certain thing, or how much of the descaling solution is left behind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should always follow the manufacturer's instructions. Breville for instance recommends using white vinegar (acetic acid) and water at a 50/50 mix for descaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not want follow the manufacturers instruction, I would use white vinegar at a 50/50 mix. This method has been used for ages to descale coffee machines. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What does moka pot cups mean?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I bought a moka pot days ago and have been using it almost everyday, each time i fill it with ground coffee and enough water and i drink it all by myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today i noticed that on its box its written 4 cups, what does it mean?
Does it mean its for 4 people and ive been drinking too much coffee each time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And im rather new to coffee drinking, so how much coffee does one drinks each time?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You are correct, four cups means four servings - but a serving is an espresso cup, not a mug. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the different coffee cultures around the world, there seems to be some correlation between cup size and strength of the brew, with the amount of coffee beans per serving very roughly the same per serving and varying amounts of water used. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a new coffee drinker, I would suspect that four servings in one go would give you quite a “kick”, but individual caffeine tolerance varies. As for how much you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; drink, that’s up to you, unless you have a medical condition where your healthcare provider tells you otherwise or you are a breastfeeding mother (“infant high on caffeine” is an experience you as parent will likely not want to repeat).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why do sugary foods taste so good with black filter coffee (no sugar)?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Just wondered why my black moccomaster filter coffee from bean tastes so good with sugary foods like donuts and ice cream. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I recently visited a coffee festival in Amsterdam and there were some discussion on this topic, or more generally about the effects of caffeine on our perception of taste. Apparently, research has shown that caffeine makes it harder for us to taste sweetness. After a bit of googling i founds the study I think they were referring to &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1750-3841.13836" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The abstract gives you pretty good idea about the study so I won't paraphrase here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perception of sweet food as less sweet apparently makes us crave and enjoy sweets more, which might explain what you have experienced.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another explanation I've heard is that sweet food compensates for the bitterness of coffee but I couldn't find any scientific evidence for that :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Leak in base of Moka pot</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a modern Bialetti stovetop moka pot. It's been used in an induction hob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has developed a leak on the side of the base &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7j0nT.jpg" alt="dark hole in center of image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does that happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can it be repaired?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I can give you only a half-answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A) No, I can’t explain what caused the hole. It looks somewhat corroded and I wonder where the discoloration comes from - maybe worth checking the cause of that and the composition of your water? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B) I discourage repairing the hole in general. For two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re operating the pot under pressure. Any repairs have to hold up to that and not just “hold the water in”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soldering and food safety are a tricky pair. You have to ensure that nothing can leach into the water that shouldn’t be there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, you will need either experience beyond some household tinkering (which I kind of suspect you don’t have, because then you’d probably have patched it up already instead of asking here) or have to pay a professional - which considering the price of a new pot probably isn’t economical. (If this pot has a special emotional meaning, other considerations come into play, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever you do, I encourage you to do some more digging into probable causes before you end up with another hole in the new pot.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can I just put the coffee on top of the water in a French Press?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1683/does-the-bloom-matter-in-french-press"&gt;Does the bloom matter in French Press?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;proper&amp;quot; method, as I understand it:
(assuming proper grounds and tools)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add coffee to empty press basin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add 1-2 inches of boiling/hot water to initiate bloom for 30 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pour remainder of water to fill press basin (proportionate to amount of coffee used)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set lid/plunger on top to preserve heat and wait for 4 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly plunger coffee, pour, and enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of my workplace configuration, this is somewhat inconvenient. It's easier and faster to pour the water first, and then put the coffee on top, making it instead look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill press basin with boiling/hot water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scoop the appropriate amount of coffee on top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set plunger on top, slightly pushing down the grounds, to preserve heat and wait for 4 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly plunger coffee, pour, and enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not noticed any appreciable difference in taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Does the coffee -&amp;gt; water -&amp;gt; water method really matter compared to my water -&amp;gt; coffee method&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I am using preground coffee (grinding at work is a mild inconvenience, and a potential HR concern ;] ).&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Confession:&lt;br&gt;
Many rules about making coffee are writen by perfectionists (or snobs or self-declared experts...) that are always on the hunt for the elusive &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; cup of coffee. So the general advice for making a certain type of coffee has to be taken with a grain of salt - which some people actually like to put in their coffee, btw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, if you are using pre-ground beans anyway&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is a compromise based on convenience already, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;if you like your coffee&lt;/strong&gt;, I see no reason why you should not continue your current process.&lt;/em&gt; I personally might give the grounds a quick stir, just to make sure they are all wet and there are no dry lumps, before putting the lid on. If you are unhappy with what your method produces, I would suggest giving the “official” order a try or start tweaking the various parameters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; There are affordable and good hand-cranked grinders available, just saying.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Will Twist Press really taste like espresso, made by hand?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/300166132/the-twist-press-coffee-maker-from-barista-and-co" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Twist Press kickstarter"&gt;Twist Press kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; promises a hand-held espresso maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q. Will the coffee it makes really taste like espresso, compared say to AeroPress coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AIUI, the key factor in brewing espresso is pressure. How much pressure is needed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twist Press develops more pressure via a screw thread, but the thread appears to be at 45° which provides only 2x leverage, and you can't lean your weight on it, which is possible but not recommended for AeroPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user presses the two handles towards each other, but that should just halve the pressing time, not increase the force. Is shorter brewing time important to making espresso (quick) taste? If so, why does this design have a closed cap for long brewing upside down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the photos, the press piston face looks about the same area as an AeroPress. A smaller piston area would increase the pressure proportionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do espresso makers use paper filters like Twist Press does?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It depends exactly how much pressure can actually be applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make proper espresso, you need 9 bars of pressure. To put that into perspective, that's about 131 lbs per square inch. I am guessing that there is no way the twist press can actually create that much pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, you will probably end up with something similar to what AeroPress or stovetop espresso (mokka) pot makes. Not quite espresso, not quite coffee. Its somewhere in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When dealing with espresso, its not so much about the time as it is the flow of the liquid through the puck. It's about a constant water flow at the proper temperature with a consistent pressure for the duration of the extraction. I don't think there is anything in press market that will ever be able to attain that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, espresso maker typically do not use paper filters, both the shower head and porta filter basket are metal.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can I store wet coffee beans in the fridge?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My coffee beans accidentally got wet. Can I store them in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days? Or not? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;From a food safety perspective, three to four days should be fine. For longer periods, simply freeze them. But...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wet beans will likely clog up your grinder and it’s probably not a good choice, flavor-wise. The wet beans will likely change flavor during the time in the fridge, and most likely not in a good way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drying them again would be better. Either place them in a single layer in a well-ventilated area or in a warm oven with the door slightly ajar. You will lose some flavor each way, but that probably can’t be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drying them again would be better. Either place them in a single layer in a well-ventilated area or in a warm oven with the door slightly ajar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to know to what temperature and for how long?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t attempt to dry wet &lt;em&gt;grounds&lt;/em&gt; - the quality would likely suffer and for brewing they will be made wet again, which would make the drying step moot. Just use them straight from the fridge (as discussed in your other Q/As) and proceed as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;beans&lt;/em&gt; are different. All preparations I am familiar with require the beans to be ground in one way or other. Pouring wet items in a grinder or mill designed for dry food will cause clumping, clogging and at worst damage your grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful drying requires two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An environment with a low relative humidity and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good air flow around the objects that are to be dried.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So arrange your beans in a single layer on a rack or tray and find a “dry and windy” spot. The temperature can be even cool room temperature (dry surroundings and airflow are crucial, not temperatures), but may cooks prefer a low oven with the door slightly ajar. Up to 50 C won’t be a problem for the beans. Drying time depends on how wet the beans were - check on them regularly and turn them around on the tray.&lt;/p&gt;

(its delicious) Then the espresso machine will nearly explode, as the heat builds, and the pressure cannot escape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what is out there for high pressure espresso machines?  I would also like to make a gaurana drink in a similar fashion, but I think it would be the same issue, with tiny particles expanding when wet, and clogging the holes in the press.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does an inconsistent roast affect espresso extraction? If so, how?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm not really asking about flavour, I understand that an inconsistent roast causes  inconsistent flavour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is how it affects the extraction itself. Does an uneven roast lead to an uneven extraction? Or does it not really matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can assume other variables are consistent, i.e. a good tamp and a consistent brew temperature within the ideal range for espresso extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;That's a tricky one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It depends on what do you mean by 'extraction'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Coffee extraction is the process of dissolving soluble flavors from coffee grounds in water&amp;quot; - from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_extraction" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Extraction is everything that the water takes from the coffee&amp;quot; - from &lt;a href="https://baristahustle.com/blog/coffee-extraction-and-how-to-taste-it/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;BaristaHustle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To remove or take out something&amp;quot; - from &lt;a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/extract" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Cambridge dictionary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the extraction process considers dissolving the flavors. An uneven roast will affect directly the flavours on the final beverage. Thus, even the perfect extraction will not be able to extract all the flavours it could if the beans weren't correctly roasted.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;For espresso, you should use a &lt;em&gt;stepless&lt;/em&gt; grinder (meaning, instead of a small number of grind sizes, you can fine tune the dial continuously) with &lt;em&gt;conical burs&lt;/em&gt; (which are a certain shape of grinding wheels that provide consistency and precision).

  <title>Does café Cubano have a distinct taste of cane sugar alongside the flavor of coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Café Cubano (also known as Cuban espresso, Cuban coffee, cafecito, Cuban pull, and Cuban shot) is a type of espresso that originated in Cuba. Specifically, it refers to an espresso shot which is sweetened (traditionally with natural brown sugar which has been whipped with the first and strongest drops of espresso).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Link: &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_espresso" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_espresso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I made my version of café Cubano using melted &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaggery" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;jaggery&lt;/a&gt; which is South India's most common version of &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_sugar#Natural_brown_sugar" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;natural brown sugar&lt;/a&gt;, I found that my cup of home-machine espresso has the distinctive taste of cane sugar/jaggery alongside the expected flavor of coffee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the taste of cane sugar distinctly present in authentic café Cubano too, or does it taste just like regular espresso sweetened with refined white sugar, which doesn't leave any specific taste of its own, apart from the coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I can’t give you an answer based on tasting the authentic product, but:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various “brown” or “raw” sugars are characterized by the molasses content, which is part of the original cane sugar juices. This juice has a characteristic flavor profile with notes reminiscent of caramel and malt. In the production of white sugar, they are filtered out, leaving behind the white “just sweet” sugar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The darker (and sometimes “wetter”) a brown sugar is, the higher the molasses content and the more extra flavor components are in the sugar. In cooking and baking, brown sugars are often used not just as sweetener, but also for the flavor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logical conclusion regarding your question is: If brown sugars are used in not-just-minute amounts, they will be noticeable. So the flavor of the Cuban coffee will and should be different from espresso with white/refined sugar. How intense the brown sugar flavor is, depends on how much sugar is used per serving and how dark it is. The term “natural brown sugar” in your source suggests a rather intense flavor, which should be quite similar to jaggery.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What temperature to froth/steam OAT milk to? {Rancilio Silvia}</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a v3 Rancilio Silvia with PID and just cant find anything solid online. Thanks. Currently set to 280 (Fahrenheit) but thats way tooooo high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to make lattes.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I believe the PID setting at 280 F is set to control the boiler temperature. For steaming there may be another setting, but it's probably unnecessary - as long as steam leaves the wand you can steam your oat milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I place my hand on the side of my metal jug to judge when I think my oat milk is steamed to perfection (I think I like it slightly cooler than most). I made myself an oat milk flat white just now and measured the final temperature at 58 C (136 F). I believe some may prefer it at up to 158 F, just like with cow's milk (there may even be some who prefer it slightly cooler).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the 280 F setting, I'd recommend setting it to 205 F, tasting an espresso shot and if it's bitter go a little lower toward 195 F. If you taste sourness you need the boiler temperature hotter or, perhaps, to grind the coffee finer.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Bialeti Brikka with Silver vs Black Bottom</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I ordered the Bialetti Brikka off of Amazon, the new one I think with the silver bottom:
&lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B008G48DW4" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008G48DW4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I received one that looks like this with the black bottom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B07F3SMMYD" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Bialetti-Brikka-Limited-Edtion-Bottom/dp/B07F3SMMYD/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=bialetti+brikka&amp;amp;qid=1568493637&amp;amp;sr=8-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that one is listed as cheaper and is I think an older model. Is that correct?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is more a question for consumer advice rather than a coffee q&amp;amp;a.&lt;br&gt; From what i can see you have 2 options :&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 - Keep the model they have sent and ask for a refund for the difference in price&lt;br&gt;
2 - Return the model they have sent and wait for them to send the correct model&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The links you provided are pretty vague but they appear to be the exact same just a variation in colour, with the black being sold as a limited edition, I'm not sure why the limited edition would be cheaper though, normally words like that are marketed to increase price.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Roughly how strong is one shot of espresso compared to a cup of drip coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Every morning, I have one 12 oz. cup of drip coffee, to the point where I have become dependent on it. When I’m traveling, it’s often hard to find someone who will make me a straight cup of coffee. I can usually find espresso on the go, but I’ve had bad experiences before where I order a drink with a single shot and end up with a headache later because I didn’t have my normal dose of caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to know &lt;em&gt;roughly&lt;/em&gt; how much caffeine is in the average shot of espresso, compared to a cup of drip coffee, so that I can estimate how many shots I need to order in my next latte in order to consume an equivalent amount of caffeine. To make things simple, let’s assume that the same beans are being used to brew the espresso as I normally use to brew my drip coffee. Is there a good rule of thumb to use here?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Caffeine content can vary a lot between different brewing methods and coffee beans used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;according to &lt;a href="https://www.roastycoffee.com/caffeine/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How Much Caffeine is in a Cup of Coffee?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Brewed Coffee (8 oz / 237 mL): 95-200 mg of caffeine&lt;br&gt;
  Espresso (1 oz / 30 mL): 47-75 mg of caffeine  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would mean your 12oz cup contains 143-300mg, and you'd need 2 to 6 espresso shots for the same amount, or 3.6 when comparing averages. (Which, personally, would make me feel rather trippy)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does Chicory make coffee taste bitter?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am new to coffee and recently ordered a dark roast pre ground coffee mix containing 20% chicory and 80% 'coffee'. No mention of date of roasting or anything. When I brew the coffee the only 'notes' I taste are bitter. I thought maybe the MokaPot i had got burnt the coffee or something bringing out bitter notes but on returning it and getting an aeropress, i get similar flavor. I am using lower temperature water and brewing for only 30 seconds in the aeropress with 30 sec plunge. Would changing my coffee make a better experience? Have got whole beans medium roast complementary with my aeropress and have ordered a hand grinder. Want to try out an Americano type drink. The latte made with my current coffee blend tastes nice.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm not a fan of chicory, though I know a lot of people who love it.  I'm not sure if I'd use the term bitter to describe it, but it's definitely distinct.  The taste your getting definitely isn't the coffee maker your using, it's what you're trying to brew.  Huffington Post had a decent write up on the "origin" of chicory &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/this-is-what-chicory-is-and-why-it-sometimes-shows-up-in-coffee_n_55918228e4b081449b4c95ff" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your new to coffee, I would suggest starting out with an Arabica coffee in a variety of roasts.  Arabica is the type of bean that grows in higher elevation and has a longer grow cycle leading to a richer and fuller flavor.  Starbucks is obviously popular and it's where I got my start when I worked there, but there are a lot of other good options.  If you have local roasters in your town or city, check them out.  A lot of local coffee shops roast their beans in house these days and they can be a good place to start.  If you don't have that option, maybe go with something like Peet's Coffee, or Caribou in the grocery store.  Seattle's Best is cheap, but it's also owned by Starbucks and is basically their second rate coffee and way-overly roasted in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the americano  or latte you're going for, I'm not sure how that will work with an aeropress as I've only really used espresso machines to make them, but you're going to want a dark roast for those as the coffee is condensed into a 1 ounce shot and diluted with water or milk respectively.  Go for a good quality espresso roast (Illy is a great choice but is pretty pricey), or something like an Italian Roast.  I would avoid going too dark (like a French Roast), but that's up to your taste preference.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What was the minimum amount of grind that gave you a decent enough quality of coffee in an Aeropress?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am new to coffee and have recently purchased an aeropress. I know my question is subjective, but I would love to know what was the minimum amount of coffee grind that gave you a decent enough solution which you could have used to make a 200ml cup of Americano with.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think you'll have to do the experiment to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measure the beans by weight rather than volume. A digital scale that resolves to 0.1 gram would suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a &lt;a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/binary-search/a/binary-search" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;binary search&lt;/a&gt; in order to converge on a result with as few trials as possible. E.g. if a reference scoop holds 8 grams, test 4 grams, then if that's too weak, split the difference to 6 grams, and so on. In only 5 trials you'll be able to get an answer to the nearest 0.25 grams; 6 trials to the nearest 0.125 grams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your goal is to use the minimum coffee to achieve acceptable taste, think ahead about how to judge if a sample taste is acceptable and how much time to wait between tastings for your mouth to clear. If your goal is to use the minimum code without noticeably changing the taste, use &lt;a href="https://www.sensorysociety.org/knowledge/sspwiki/pages/triangle%20test.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the triangle test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control the other brewing variables as tightly as you can: grind size, brewing water temperature (with a thermometer), water volume in the press and in bypass (Americano), brewing time, stirring amount, ... I think the most sensitive factors are water temperature and grind size -- and of course the batch of beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do report back!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Capsule coffee machine for home for one person: is it worth it to go for an expensive one?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm choosing capsule coffee machine for home. There is a lot of options with different prices. I would like to know if it's worth it to go for a more expensive one ? Will coffee taste better ?
What else should I pay attention to ?
I'll have one-two coffee per day and don't mind if the machine is loud or slow.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If saving money is a priority, you can get a single-serving capsule coffee machine for about $20. This will do fine for a cup or two a day. You have to add water to the machine before brewing each cup, which may be a bit repetitive for more than a few cups a day. It does, however ensure you put fresh water in there for each brew as opposed to letting the water sit in the reservoir going stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like larger servings, make sure your machine supports more than just the usual 12 ounces per brew; many machines offer 12 ounces as the "large" serving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want your brew made for you automatically at a specified time (waking up to a fresh cup of coffee is certainly a plus in the morning), your expenses will start going up for machines with clocks and timers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If refilling the single-serving water reservoir becomes a chore due to increased coffee consumption, get a model that has a larger reservoir, so the only thing you have to attend to is the capsule. The machine will tell you when it needs the water tank refilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some machines add more bells and whistles such as a milk frother; if those extra features and accessories appeal to you, you are looking at spending in the three digit price range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend getting a machine that can make both capsule-based and ground coffee. This will provide more flavor options as not every coffee is sold in capsule form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as quality is concerned, the aforementioned cheap single-cup machines tend to be made from cheap plastic parts and they may start malfunctioning sooner. The lid mechanisms are the first ones to go (moving parts usually are), and if you have a dual-purpose machine, the cheap plastic filter may start to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not neglect to change the water filter in the reservoir at the manufacturer recommended intervals.
To answer the other part of your question, with the same amount of water and the same capsule, you will be hard pressed to notice any differences in taste when going up in price.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Issue pressing down French Press</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I haven't had this issue happen often, but its been a few times. When I make French Press coffee my steps are to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boil water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put coffee grinds in French Press&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour hot water in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stir coffee grinds in the water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Place the lid on top&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait 3 1/2 minutes and then press it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in a while when I go to press it down, it just doesn't want to press. There is so much pressure resisting underneath. The one time I kept pressing, the coffee and grinds shot out the top and burned me. It seems as if too much air gets trapped underneath but I don't know how. Does anyone know why this happens; if I am doing anything wrong that causes this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A number of things aren't clear from your question. I can think of three issues that might result in the problem you're having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clogged strainer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the strainer is clogged, the air has trouble being pushed out. That may make it harder to push it down as the air stays under your strainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is easy, make sure the equipment is cleaned well, a bit of soap does wonders to remove oily residuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be using large equipment to make a small amount of coffee. That way, when you're pressing down the strainer is already near the bottom of your container meaning you cannot press much further. To solve this, try using a container of an appropriate size. If your French press is filled at least halfway at step 4 then this shouldn't be an issue, if it's much less, consider making a larger batch or using a smaller French press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blooming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/348/6506"&gt;Blooming&lt;/a&gt; is technique for letting gasses (mainly carbon dioxide) escape the coffee beans. I don't think this is what causing you trouble, but I think it's worth mentioning. To get a good bloom, you just need to take some time between step 4 and step 5. After stirring the beans, you wait 30 to 60 seconds to allow some of the gasses to escape.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Aeropress: coffee starts flowing as soon as I flip it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I do the inverted method with my aeropress. Put the ground coffee, 40g of water, stir, put 60g more of water. Wait for it to brew. Put the lid, and flip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I flip it on the mug, I can hear the water dripping &lt;em&gt;rather faster&lt;/em&gt; than I'd like. Is this normal? Shouldn't the water stay in (or at least drip &lt;em&gt;very slowly&lt;/em&gt;) until I actually push the handle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a 1:10 coffee to water ratio, with ~1min brew time, and ~20s push. I use grind size 11 on my &lt;a href="http://www.comandantegrinder.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Comandante&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This will happen if you are using flavored coffee, if you're using too much water relative to coffee, or if your grind size is too large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flavored coffee causes this because a big portion of the "coffee grounds" are actually flavoring solids that dissolve in water. When you add water, those solids dissolve, and you're left with not enough coffee to hold back the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too much water relative to coffee can cause this simply because of gravity. More water means more force pushing down on the coffee beans, and that means more water can get through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grind size too large is a likely cause. Your coffee simply might not be creating a cohesive barrier to water. Coarsely ground coffee will do this because the coarse grinds leave little gaps where the irregularly shaped grinds touch. Water can flow through those gaps. For Aeropress, you want a grind setting between drip and espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I would probably throw them out - I would just roast more - but I might also try and spreading them out on a flat tray that fits into the oven and turn it up to 200F (or lower) and let them sit in there until they are dry again. Just keep your eye on them and check frequently. If you start to smell them, they are probably past dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No idea how that will turn out, but my wife does a similar thing with crackers that have lost their crunchiness.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Shelf-Stable Half and Half - How stable?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;At my place of employment, they supply coffee.  Along with cups, lids, and sweeteners they provide the little plastic containers of half and half.  The box these come in states, "No Refrigeration Necessary."  The date on the box is usually a few months into the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, I will find what appears to be curdles in the half and half.  Has it really curdled or is it more of a settling or congealing in the half and half?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These "curdles" are small, white, and float in the coffee.  The larger "curdles" do not dissolve when stirred.  I think I have noticed an odd/off taste but I don't use half and half consistently so I'm not sure if it's due to the "curdles".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how stable is this type half and half?&lt;br&gt;
Will it get REALLY chunky if left long enough? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It might simply be the homogenization process starting to reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homogenization process emulsifies fat globules suspended in the milk so the packaged product keeps its taste, stability and texture for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more effective the homogenization process, longer the milk will remain stable and keep its commercial value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UHT milk faces a range of limiting factors when it comes to shelf life. As a natural product, it is subject to biological processes such as sedimentation and fat separation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, enzymes in the milk can cause age gelation, coagulation and – sometimes – a bitter taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming such obstacles is a top priority for milk producers. Aseptically packaged UHT milk has a typical shelf life of around three months, though is typically consumed well in advance of the best before date.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try giving each single-serving container a good shake before opening it, and see if the &amp;quot;occasionally&amp;quot; reduces to &amp;quot;rarely&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does coffee oxidize in a travel mug if there air left in the mug?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been brewing an Ethiopian bean recently on the Fellow Stagg Pour Over, and experienced something interesting. When brewing fresh at home, the coffee has delicious fruit notes. However, I brewed it once and took it in a travel mug to work, while it had the same qualities, the fruitiness tasted stale, and more like "old fruit".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if this is due to the coffee degrading due to travel, or if it has oxidized by the leftover airspace in the cup (note: this particular cup has an air-tight seal for a lid). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, my question is, does coffee oxidize while traveling, and does the amount of headspace you leave in your travel mug affect how well the coffee travels? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[EDIT]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this question has already been answered &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/367/chemically-whats-happening-to-coffee-after-its-brewed"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is coffee a drug that you could give to your dog?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes questions are very short and answers very long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all like coffee, but, would you give coffee to your dog?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/drug?s=t" rel="noreferrer"&gt;dictionary.com&lt;/a&gt;, one of the definitions of the word &lt;em&gt;drug&lt;/em&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a chemical substance used in the treatment, cure, prevention, or diagnosis of disease or used to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As caffeine, which coffee contains, is an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_ingredient" rel="noreferrer"&gt;active ingredient&lt;/a&gt; in some medicines (such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anadin" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Anadin&lt;/a&gt;) it certainly fits that definition so it would be correct to say that coffee contains a drug (putting aside decaf). If you take the first sentence of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; that describes &lt;em&gt;drug&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A drug (/dr???/) is any substance that causes a change in an organism's physiology or psychology when consumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caffeine also fits that definition as there's a body of evidence that supports that description when talking about caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you give coffee to your dog?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely not. There is a page on petmd.com titled &lt;a href="https://www.petmd.com/dog/emergency/poisoning-toxicity/caffeine-and-pets-safety-tips-and-considerations" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Caffeine and Pets: Safety Tips and Considerations&lt;/a&gt; which states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It turns out our pets react in much the same way we do. Caffeine makes them restless. They get jittery and their hearts start to race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn't sound.... ideal! It turns out that it's not, and the next part of the page makes it pretty clear why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But because our pets weigh so much less than we do, it only takes a relatively small amount of caffeine to cause a big problem, potentially leading to expensive hospitalization or even death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further on in the article it's explained that 23-27mg caffeine per lb of body weight can lead to cardio-toxicity. For a 3.5kg cat, such as mine, that equates to between 177mg and 207mg of caffeine. Based on the table in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1538/1587"&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;, that puts a double espresso or a 200mg caffeine tablet squarely in that range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's absolutely not to say that giving your dog, or other pet, coffee (even decaf!) is something you should consider doing. The petmd page states it much better than I ever could (my emphasis):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Cats and dogs should not ingest any caffeine,”&lt;/strong&gt; says Dr. Elisa Mazzaferro, adjunct associate clinical professor of emergency-critical care at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, New York.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Choosing grind size should be considered for older coffee beans?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have heard that if you have some 2-week to 1 month old coffee beans (since roast date), you should grind the beans finer as time passes. This is for the pour over method. Is this necessarily true and why? And of course, there could be possible secondary factors/combinations based on equipment used and type of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The reason this is suggested is because beans essentially lose flavor over time. They go stale and their oils go rancid. Grinding finer exposes more surface area of the bean to the brew and helps you eke out a bit more flavor when the bean is old and stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, doing this for pour over can backfire as pour over is highly sensitive to grind. Too fine and your pour over won't drain; the filter will clog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it first with your normal grind, and if that's no good, dial it one or two clicks finer. Much past that and you're in no go territory for the brew method most likely.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee description decipher</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;This might seem an odd question, but it is indeed a genuine one where I presume I could get useful information. I recently have gotten into enjoying "specialty coffee" performing pour over at home (due to COVID-19). After acquiring a bag of Blue Bottle Bella Donovan, I was curious to look up the characteristics/description of the beans, from the Blue Bottle website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bella Donovan is the wool sweater of our blends—comforting, cozy, and enveloping. Our most popular blend, Bella is a variation of the archetypal Moka-Java pairing, in which a wild and jammy natural from Ethiopia finds balance with more substantive coffees from Sumatra and Peru. It stands on the darker side of things, weathers the rigors of the automatic drip machine well, and stands up to milk or cream—though it is just as elegant black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand it is an Ethiopia/Sumatra blend. Could someone please explain to me what exactly this whole description means to someone who is new to coffee characteristics? For anyone who has had this coffee before, I genuinely would love to hear a "layman's" description of the coffee in comparison to any other coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm a big coffee drinker and after many different brands and roasts tried, I'm very sure coffee taste notes on the bag or website are literally just marketing and not descriptive of the coffee at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a dark roasted blend of Ethiopian, Sumatran, and Peruvian beans. It's probably going to taste like a tame (less bitter) but strong black. Don't expect anything wild like Kicking Horse, etc., and don't expect anything absurd, like fruity or chocolatey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee generally does like this: it tastes generally like coffee. Differences between blends are typically minor and nuanced things that can't be described well with words. There are notable exceptions, but still, the differences are hard to describe.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How many different sizes should a shop serve for a flat white?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I visit a shop they simply list flat white. Other times there are many many options for size. What is the correct way to serve a flat white?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It is common for a shop to offer only one size of flat white because a flat is a very basic drink. It's a shot of espresso with foam added. That's all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you further dilute a flat white by adding milk, you have a latte. If you multiply a flat white by using two or more shots of espresso, you end up with two or more flat whites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run a shop and the flat white is a popular drink, add a double size and see how it fares. Go from there based on product performance. I'd not go more than a triple though because three shots of espresso in one drink is getting a little bananas.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there a name for this Americano/Long Black Variation?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am quite sensitive to caffeine so when brewing espresso I want to extend the enjoyment of my drink. An americano to me is way too much water and I lose a lot of what I think makes an espresso amazing. No water added and I drink the coffee too quickly and find myself wanting another. This is my new recipe: to help extend my drink. I brew a standard double espresso of about 36-40g and add that same weight in water. If I made a 40g espresso I would add 40g more of water. I think of it like a cortado but instead of milk I use water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am wondering if this is an actual drink and if it has a name or if it is just some crazy successful experiment I made up. &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I mostly drink Americano's  at my favorite coffee roaster, Kaladi Brothers Coffee, ( &lt;em&gt;barista's take a two week training before they are allowed to pull shots for customers&lt;/em&gt; ) but occasionally i get a Stretched Lungo. ( &lt;em&gt;French Press Exclusively at home&lt;/em&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.coffeefeature.com/what-is-lungo-coffee/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lungo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link will educate you as to the particulars of the Lungo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Both lungos and Americanos are made using an espresso machine and
  water. Which makes you ask ‘Is a lungo an Americano?’. The method of
  making both these coffees sounds the same, but there is a big
  difference. When you make a lungo, all of the water is brewed and it
  generally comes out shorter than an Americano.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;When you make an Americano you add the water after the espresso has
  been pulled from the espresso machine. Americanos also usually come in
  larger cups so you can add as much water as you like to the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Lungos should be served in a slightly smaller cup because you don’t
  need to add any water after making it. But if you really like, no one
  will probably judge you if you do!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Both coffees are made with ground coffee and roughly the same amount
  of water. So you’d expect them to taste the same right? Wrong. Adding
  the water after the espresso has been pulled gives you a weaker
  flavored coffee. Having the water pass through the ground coffee
  granules, as they do in a Lungo, gives you a much stronger flavored
  coffee. Great for those of you who like a strong dark coffee to kick
  start your day!&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Check the ingredients and nutrition facts on the package. Particularly carbohydrates. Coffee and artificial sweeteners have no carbs, so if you see carbs, it's probably all sugar. Generally the answer is yes, they have added sugar.

  <title>Stove top coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been meaning to get some proper coffee making equipment these days (my french press broke recently) in the meantime I've been experimenting with making coffee on the stove with a pot and for the most part it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;however since the water is boiling sometimes the consistency of the coffee (clearity/concentration) vary with each brew. With a french press there is some mechanism in place to improve clearity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any ideas for filtering using a stove top?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I'll do this when there's a kitchen but no coffee making equipment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boil water in the pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once it's boiling, take it off the heat and wait 20-30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add 2 tablespoons (15 g) of coffee to the pot for every cup (8 oz / 250 mL) of water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait 4 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour coffee slowly into a mug/cup through a fine mesh sieve with a cheesecloth or coffee filter (if you have one). Try to leave as many grounds in the pot as possible. This is what has the biggest effect on clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Simulated Vietnamese coffee in Bobba bars</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Vietnamese coffee is on the menu at most San Diego CA Bobba bars. They use freshly extracted espresso, but then, instead of sweetened condensed milk, they appear to use a combination of flavors like hazelnut and vanilla. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would one approach changing a regular Vietnamese bubble coffee recipe into a flavored version?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A bubble tea (or in this case, coffee) drink consists of roughly these parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a liquid (in this case, coffee or espresso)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sugar and / or a flavoring ingredient  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tapioca pearls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ice to dilute and chill it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your case, the use of sweetened condensed milk make it &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_iced_coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;“Vietnamese coffee”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get some additional flavor into the drink, use the coffee shop staple &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavored_syrup" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;flavor syrup&lt;/a&gt; - the same product that is used to flavor other espresso-based drinks. They should be readily available in your local supermarket (&lt;a href="https://www.monin.com/us/flavor-for-coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Monin&lt;/a&gt; being a well-known brand for example), online at the usual retailers, or your nearest coffee chain may be selling &lt;a href="https://athome.starbucks.com/starbucks-coffee-complements/syrups/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;their own product&lt;/a&gt;. If you are so inclined, a websearch will also lead to lots of home-made recipes, especially for flavors like caramel or vanilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how would a substitution work?&lt;br&gt;
In short, you can either &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the syrup in addition to the sweetened condensed milk (will be extra sweet as you have two sugar sources)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use it instead of the sweetened condensed milk (if you are not interested in the milky component) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use it with unsweetened milk, condensed or regular, or coffee cream for the creamier mouthfeel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a large drink, a splash of syrup should be intense enough, although it depends a bit on the chosen brand. Start with a teaspoon or two, add more to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a Rocket R58 and I'm twondering if it would be safe to keep it in a low temperature place like a garage. Let's say that would be something like 12C. I've had a look around at both the manual for my machine and several others but I can't see any instructions beyond guidance around storage temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that they mention that it's important to not let it freeze which is sensible and pretty obvious. I've also had a search around google but can't find anything around operating temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do any coffee machines have explictly stated safe operating temperature ranges and if so what are they? If this isn't common, have any of you used espresso machines in colder environments longer term and are there any issue involved / is there anything I should look out for?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Any coffe machine is quite broad. I suggest considering the materials involved. Since portafilter machines are meant to operate on higher than ambient temperatures for a very long time, lower temps aren't usually a problem in terms of degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't remember any materials involved in a portafilter machine that would degrade faster (or et damaged) in lower temperatures rather than operating temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dependig on the age, there might be hemp sealings in the machine that could potentially dry out.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Milk appears to separate from steaming, how do I fix this?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So I'm using fresh, semi-skinned, filtered milk in a cold pitcher. My espresso machine is a Sage / Breville Barista Express. I blast my steam wand before I heat the milk as sometimes the first few seconds are just water out the wand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend the first few seconds adding air to the milk and once it's thickened a bit and the bubbles have gone, I bury the tip and spend the next 40 seconds or so just heating it until it reaches temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I pour my milk, the bit that gets to the spout first tends to look very thin and watery and kind of &amp;quot;below&amp;quot; the rest of the milk, running faster. By the end of the pour it's very thick and frothed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if this is because the milk has separated somehow, or the steam wand is somehow adding water to the mix or I'm doing something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I get that gloss paint consistency through the whole pitcher?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If the milk is cow fresh... You will have to put it through a process called homogenization. It is normally done when the milk is pasteurized for us who are chained to grocery carts. Homogenization is where the fat of the milk becomes emulsified and it keeps the cream from separating out. The following article contains a description of the process:

  <title>Why do I get worse results with a non-pressurized filter basket?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I own a DeLonghi Dedica coffee machine for a year now and recently invested in a good burr grinder (Sage Dose Control Pro). I like drinking long coffees with milk and I’m satisfied with the coffee the DeLonghi machine produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine comes with pressurized filter baskets, and after doing some research online I found that non pressurized filter baskets can actually produce even better espresso. So I decided to buy a naked portafilter with a non-pressurized filter basket on AliExpress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am still struggling to get something good out of the non-pressurized one. Often it is so strong and bitter that I can’t even finish it and I can’t wrap my head around why this is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it possible, given the same dose of ground coffee and the same grind setting, that with a pressurized filter basket I can create a coffee that’s actually pretty nice, and it doesn’t even matter how much water runs through the coffee grounds, if my tamp was level, etc., but with the non pressurized basket I can’t get anything drinkable?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You will need to grind a lot finer with the non-pressurised baskets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a pressurised filter basket, the resistance is mostly produced by the one tiny hole in the filter basket. For non-pressurised ones, the coffee needs to provide the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the grounds fail to provide enough resistance, the water will run through the coffee really fast, probably creating a bunch of channels which you can usually see as little holes in the coffee bed after the extraction. The problem with the channels is that most of the water goes through the channels (over extracting the coffee there) instead of evenly extracting all available grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Looking for a good pod coffee maker</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm an occasional avid coffee drinker. That is, I don't drink much (at most 1 cup a day, sometimes a few days with 0 cups) but when I do I want it to be (really) good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want a good cup of regular coffee, and possibly a latte every now and then. I don't care too much for an espresso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now I've used the freeze dried stuff and sometimes one of those glass wait-and-then-press things. Both of them with mediocre results that leaves me wanting (most likely because I'm in a hurry and don't do it properly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I want to get better coffee, without breaking the bank and without needing to count seconds or measure precise amounts of anything (both are things I suck at early in the morning). To me the capsule coffee makers seem like the perfect solution. But which one should I get?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many of them. Went to a Nespresso store today and they let me taste a coffee from Nespresso Vertuo Next which in all honestly was good (better than what I usually drink) although I kind of expected even better, and when I read reviews about it they were.. mixed (things like the first cup being cold). So I'm back to square one and not knowing what I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you guys have some tips? I'm hoping to stay within or under 230 USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1.&lt;/strong&gt; Was asked to define a (to me) good cup of coffee. This is hard and I doubt I know the correct terms for what you are asking me to describe.. But I'll give it a stab. I like a well rounded cup, that's not too bitter (I usually stay away from the really dark roast) but I also want a distinct strong coffee taste (not watered down). In my opinion, a good cup of coffee does not need milk or sugar (although I do add milk sometimes, and I do enjoy a latte every now and then). I also want a good crema on the cup. Oh, and it needs to be hot. I hate cold coffee, I want it above 90 degrees celcius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a vacation to Teneriffa a few years ago I realized that every single little mom and pop shop had this machine (or very similar) and were all extremely good at making a good cup of joe. I have since then not tasted as good coffee as I had during that week again. Just thinking about it makes me want to go back just for the damn coffee.

</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This may be heresy: An espresso machine plus a grinder is overkill for a one cup a day person. Try Nespresso Vertuo. Their coffee is excellent and comes in a wide selection of tastes. In my opinion, much better than anything from Kuerig. I own two Vertuo machines, one for office, one for home. I'm not in any way connected to Nespresso except as a satisfied customer.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are the best single shot filter baskets</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm using a Gaggia classic with the 58mm diameter portafilter that comes with it. I basically only drink single shots, but they are still difficult for me to get right. My grinder is a baratza encore, which I think is part of the difficulty I'm having. The shots have good flavor, but the extraction time is quite short (~15 seconds) and so is the preinfusion time (usually ~2 seconds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I go finer on the grind, I get more bitterness than I'd like. I'm pretty sure that's mostly due to the inconsistent grind from the encore, but it could also be the uneven extraction from the filter basket itself or my tamping technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using the filter basket that comes with the gaggia, but I'm using a calibrated 30lb tamper that almost exactly fits my portafilter (maybe &amp;lt; 0.5 mm difference in size). Since I'm using a single shot basket, I expect that the tamp force isnt properly distributing over the entire surface of the puck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not ready to invest in a more expensive grinder, should I even bother with a precision filter basket/differently engineered basket?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, what are the aspects to look for? What are the models to consider?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to coffeeSE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not ready to invest in a more expensive grinder, should I even bother with a precision filter basket/differently engineered basket?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;, do not bother with precision filter baskets. The Baratza Encore is definitely not a grinder for espresso, it is meant for brewing methods which use coarser grinds like filter coffee or French press. It cannot grind fine enough properly - you get an inconsistent grind. Baratza offers the Sette series which grinds fine enough and consistent enough to get good espresso. I really wouldn't recommend buying a high end basket until you have a proper grinder, maybe look for used grinders. I got mine super cheap because it was used and after a proper clean it was almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One rule of thumb when getting into espresso is to spend at least as much on your grinder as you spend on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, what are the aspects to look for? What are the models to consider?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really do want to experiment with a high precision basket, just look for one which fits your portafilter (shouldn't be too hard since you have a standard 58mm one), is big enough for your desired dose, and is from a somewhat reputable brand (and is ideally used by professionals).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the point of having a Q&amp;A website dedicated to coffee?</title>

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Someone is new to the world of coffee, (&lt;em&gt;it is not a day to day task for them and there are hundred of ways to make coffee from all over the world&lt;/em&gt;) and they  have a question about coffee. They do not know anybody who is knowledgeable about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They turn to the interwebs to find information. They do  a web search but there is so much crap and misinformation to filter out that a good and correct  answer is very difficult to find, so they think Gosh why don't i put up a site were  anybody can ask a question about coffee and those in the know can post answers to those questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best answers will be voted on so they rise to the top and eventually a correct answer will be chosen. Misinformation will be called out and not allowed to misguide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future if somebody else may have the same question and they do an interweb search on it, one of the search hits will be the &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Question and Answer&lt;/a&gt;  site where a correct answer was given to the very question they are wanting an answer for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this could work for &lt;a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites#"&gt;All kinds of things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I believe that is corrosion of the metal depending on what is put in that container and the chemical properties of that substance can lead to wear and tear on the metal. Test this out to see if this works mix a baking soda solution and let it soak in the pot for 30 min to an hour. Then wash the pot that should remove it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What to look for in a good french press?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am looking to buy a french press as my moka is now a little damaged. The handle melted because of misuse and now I have to handle the moka with oven gloves. It is a hassle to do, I spilled coffee all over the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price range for french press is insane. A functioning french press can be bought from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nerthus-French-Press-Coffee-Maker/dp/B08554TV6T/ref=sr_1_46?crid=1U32V0RCVXA3G&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=french%20press%20coffee%20maker&amp;amp;qid=1603809374&amp;amp;sprefix=french%20%2Caps%2C197&amp;amp;sr=8-46" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;£6.90&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Groenenberg-Cafeti%C3%A8re-Stainless-Double-Walled-Replacement/dp/B086LKQ7WV/ref=sr_1_21?crid=1U32V0RCVXA3G&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=french%20press%20coffee%20maker&amp;amp;qid=1603809427&amp;amp;sprefix=french%20%2Caps%2C197&amp;amp;sr=8-21" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;£25.99&lt;/a&gt;. It is a lot of money to pay if there is no difference. &lt;strong&gt;So, what makes a good french press?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have more specific questions at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually models whose external design is metallic rather than plastic are more expensive. Does the external mesh affect the taste or healthiness of the coffee? How durable is the external mesh compared to the glass, i.e., would I expect to use a metallic french press longer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One model displays &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/BODUM-1923-109s-Plunger-Cafetiere-Transparent/dp/B078VM925J/ref=sxts_sxwds-deals?crid=1U32V0RCVXA3G&amp;amp;cv_ct_cx=french%20press%20coffee%20maker&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=french%20press%20coffee%20maker&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B078VM925J&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=0777da5f-ffb8-408c-ab1a-6c9459710109&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=IPEC1&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=uSR28&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=f19c6998-9ae0-4218-a0ea-903d8ebdc53c&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=CKT6CJP26J5BKM2GJ6X0&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;qid=1603809427&amp;amp;sprefix=french%20%2Caps%2C197&amp;amp;sr=1-3-639fa736-8ebd-4159-8516-a629dca5da33" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;cork on top&lt;/a&gt;. Does it have any affect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some models come with extra filters. How frequent do I need to change filters and why do I need to change them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheaper models don't even mention about stainless steel. How does stainless steel impact the coffee maker from health, taste and durability perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologise if such questions are out of topic. I would be happy to ask all these specific question separately if it is considered too broad for this SE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it safe to use aluminum foil inside a moka pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My moka pot is sputtering coffee instead of pouring flowing coffee so I'm trying to find a solution on how to fix this. I stumbled upon &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yGinq5NaCA&amp;amp;t" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;, with a similar issue in which the filter is a bit loose so the heated gas doesn't transfer properly. His solution was to use some PFTE tape on the filter to make it tighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father saw this and said that aluminium foil would work better because it's meant to be put on food. I am no expert and just want to be safe. Are there some hazardous side effects when using aluminium foil?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;With the moka pot being made of aluminum itself, there isn't really any health effects from using foil. If there is a worry about ingesting tiny flakes of aluminum, you'd have a worse time eating that leftover lasagna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only caveat is if you use too much and it wedges the funnel into the basin and you can't remove it. As a side note, with the pot being much thicker than the funnel, it would also be pretty much impossible to crack it doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have followed his advice and made sure the gasket is in good shape and not indented too much. The lip around the funnel could be out of shape, and like he showed sits deeper than what the gasket can seal.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is an optimal coffee to water ratio for pour-overs?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any good recommendations for an optimal coffee to water ratio for pour-overs? I am not interested in cold brews and I use a Chemex carafe with Chemex filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generally prefer light to medium-dark roasts, but I am open to trying other roasts that tend towards the darker side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would guess that dark roasts may require a lower coffee to water ratio than lighter roasts.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is going to be unpopular but my routine doesn't really involve measuring much.  I want get the brewing over with ASAP so I can drink my coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prime the filter with hot water and pour out water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put in ground coffee, I just use 6 TBSP for the 8 cup classic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prime grounds by pouring just enough in to stir them up and get wet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for gas to release (should have a nice cone of grounds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pour water into the center of the grinds and then circulate as water rises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait until brewed coffee gets to the belly button of the chemex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pour more water in until it is about 1/4 inch to the top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let drain out and enjoy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just go a bit bigger with my scoops if I'm looking for more of dark brew.  My goal here is to control the output so that when finished I have enough coffee for about two pint glasses.  Thy key is that belly button which I'm guessing is the half-way mark.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How do I make a single shot of espresso with a semi-automatic machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just bought this Barista express from Breville. How long is the extraction time for singe shot, 9 gramme coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also i did a double shot, setting is at 7 and grind amount in the middle... how do I determine the grind amount?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the basics for double - 19gramme of coffee and around 25mp extraction time... it see,s this 7 and middle works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about the single shot?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In general, aim for 2 to 2.5 times the amount of beverage in your cup to the used coffee. If you use 9g of coffee in, aim for 18-23g out. The brew time stays the same. If you compare a single basket to a regular double basket you can see that it's narrower at the bottom, this is intended to restrict flow so you have approximately the same brew time using the same grind size but less coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brew time of 25-30 seconds is what you should aim for but it's not something you absolutely have to follow. It very well may be that your coffee tastes great at 36 or 23 seconds, it's just a ballpark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From your question it seems that you're somewhat familiar with brewing espresso but still a beginner. There are a lot of good YouTube videos on this, made by people far more competent and eloquent than me. I think &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTFsBqhpLes&amp;amp;list=PLxz0FjZMVOl3MuAzK5l3gjakoOGrmK8fP" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this video series&lt;/a&gt; on understanding each variable in brewing espresso is a good start if you're interested.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Totally up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paper filter will filter the oils in the coffee and give you a &amp;quot;brighter&amp;quot; flavor in your coffee. Filtering the oil out may also change the health factors of drinking coffee, since those oils provide nutrition elements that are both good for you and bad for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal filter by itself will let oils and fines into your final brew. The oils will make the coffee taste richer and more earthy. The fines (which are dust like fine grinds of coffee) will create some sludge in the final brew. Not a lot probably, but some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest that if you like how the coffee tastes with a paper filter, keep using a paper filter. And if you want to try without paper, consult the manual first to make absolutely sure this is ok with your machine. I can't tell which model Cooks 12 cup you have, so I don't know if your machine actually has a permanent filter or just a basket.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>My coffee isn't acidic enough?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;This question is difficult to google because of the overwhelming amount of people looking for &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; acidic coffee, but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My (very cheap) 4-cup Cuisinart drip-style coffee maker (like the kind you'd find in a hotel) fits the bill for me in most ways: size, ease of use and cleanup, simplicity. I've had more involved ways of making coffee in my life and noticed the joy slip away when I have to work for 30 minutes just to have a nice hot cup before my brain is even awake enough to know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only buy light and medium roast single-origin coffees from regions like Guatemala and Ethiopia because they seem to correspond to brighter (read: more acidic) and more fruity flavors, and I grind it myself, albeit with a blade grinder, so I'm fairly certain the beans aren't to blame. Also use a 1:17 by weight ratio of coffee to tap water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm interested to know why the coffee I'm making is so muted compared to the other extraction methods I'm used to (pour over, Aeropress, french press). The cup that comes out of this machine is the opposite of bright and citrusy; more like muddy. It's not terrible, but if I add a pinch of citric acid, it certainly brightens up (though there's no accompanying fruity/citrusy smell).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it my grinder, extraction method, or coffee maker? Or maybe something else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;To add to cabmeurer's answer, I think a big reason for the lower levels of acidity in your drip coffee when compared with other methods (pour-over, Aeropress, etc.) comes down to temperature. &lt;a href="http://coffeegeek.com/forums/coffee/machines/568286" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; shows the results of sticking a temperature probe below the shower screen in a Cuisinart drip coffee machine similar to the one you have: when the water tank is filled with cold (15°C) tap water, the resulting brew is made with water that is 88°C or colder. Meanwhile, the brew temperature of a pour-over or Aeropress made with water fresh off the boil will be much higher, closer to 95°C. Brewing at higher temperatures might be what allows you to get more of the acidity you desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, that same post shows that using hot (45°C) tap water to fill the water tank of the drip machine can help to increase its brewing temperature. With cold water in the tank, it takes a full 6 minutes for the water leaving the shower screen to reach 88°C; with hot tap water instead it takes just 1 minute, and the brew temperature eventually reaches 95°C. Still maybe not as hot as other brewing methods, but perhaps an improvement on what you've got at the moment. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mochas are latte-based drinks. They use steamed and frothed milk, not just plain milk. Steamed and frothed milk are both produced by mixing air and heat with milk (typically by injecting steam, by heating and agitating, or by a combination of these) to make it creamier. You can make frothed milk without special tools by agitating milk aggressively while heating it on the stove. Use a hand mixer or immersion blender. If you like the effect, you can buy dedicated frother devices for about $30-40 online.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Percolation vs Osmotic brewing method: is it the same thing?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have just learned a pour-over brewing method called &amp;quot;Osmotic Flow&amp;quot; as in the link below:
&lt;a href="https://cafec-jp.com/brewing-guide/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://cafec-jp.com/brewing-guide/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article said it used osmotic pressure to extract coffee essence from grounded coffee, as opposed to &amp;quot;full immersion&amp;quot; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the osmotic method looks pretty much like a normal pour-over method (except pouring only at the center) in which we usually called it percolation method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you please help explain how percolation and Osmotic are different? or it is just the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;What's strange is that the post you link to describes full immersion as falling under the category of 'pour-over techniques'. Typically it's more common to think of two categories, percolation and immersion. Percolation covers everything involving water being pushed through a bed of coffee - so low-pressure percolation would be something like a Chemex or V60 pour-over, and a high-pressure percolation could be something like espresso. Meanwhile, immersion brewing covers French presses, cold brew, cupping preparation, Turkish coffee etc. where the coffee grounds sit in some water for a while, and then we use some method - the mesh in a French press or the steady hand of someone preparing Turkish coffee - to separate the grounds after. Some brewing methods blur the line between these two categories, like the Aeropress or the Clever dripper, which immerse coffee grounds in water for a period of time, and then use some mechanism to percolate the water through the grounds. Given all this, describing a 'full immersion' brew as a type of pour-over method is... weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like what the linked post describes as a 'full immersion' pour-over is essentially a bad or failed pour-over. In a pour-over, what we want to do is have a steady flow of water through the bed of coffee, and we use things like water temperature, brew time, grind size, grind dose, etc. to control the level of extraction in our brew. Too little extraction means a dull, boring cup of coffee; too much extraction can produce lots of bitterness or acidity or nasty flavours in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in a pour-over brew, for whatever reason - perhaps the grinds were too fine and clogged the filter paper, or perhaps the filter stuck to the brewing vessel and created a vacuum - the brew will stall and fail to draw down like it normally would. This increases our brew time and can lead to over-extraction with lots of bitter notes - which the post describes as 'unpleasant taste components'. It seems like this 'Osmotic Flow' is basically a bunch of tips for avoiding a stalled pour-over brew: try not to disturb the bed of coffee too much with rapid or heavy pouring, use a bloom phase, pour in batches instead of all at once, and so on. All good tips - but certainly not a new brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, then: percolation is one of the two main families of brew methods, alongside immersion brewing. A sub-category of percolation are pour-over methods - things like the V60, Chemex, etc. This 'Osmotic Flow' method doesn't seem to be a method at all; instead, it's a set of tips for how to have a good pour-over and avoid the common problem of a stalled brew. Helpful - but not a new method!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it more economical to use cold or hot water?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have an electric kettle to boil water for tea/coffee that switches off automatically when water boils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can either pour cold or warn water from a sink. Warm water is not hot enough, so it will need to be boiled anyway, but for shorter time (smaller difference to a boiling temperature) and thus lower electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming, that I am not in a hurry (so time difference is not important), I am wondering what will be cheaper for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to pour cold water (that is cheaper) and boil it longer (using more electricity), or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to pour warm water (that is more expensive) and boil it shorter (less electricity)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold water costs me 9,85 PLN/m3 and warm water costs me (9,85 + 25,88 =) 35,73 PLN/m3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity costs 0,3195 PLN/kWh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I do not know how much electricity does my kettle consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I able to calculate how should I boil water for my tea/coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;From a physics point of view, over 85%  of the energy of heating 20 C or 50 C water and boiling it at 100 C goes into actually boiling it. In fact, comparing the heat required  for equal amounts (say, 1/2 liter) of water starting at 20 C vs 50 C, the energy difference is 62 kJ or 0.017 kWh, thermal.  Electric kettles are very efficient, so figure 0.020 kWh electrical difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't waste the water.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Gaggia Classic and am generally happy with my pulls.  18g of grinds pulls in 20ish seconds give or take.  I have a tamper with a spring and feel I'm fairly consistent overall.  Baratza Encore burr grinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I've noticed recently is that the puck is pretty damp after and occasionally sticks to the group screen instead of coming off in the portafilter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this indicate any particular issue I should be aware of?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce your dose.&lt;/strong&gt; Having your puck stick to the brew head means the grounds are in contact with the brew head. If you reduce your dose by 1-2g the surface should be low enough as to avoid direct contact with the brew head. Depending on your brew head you might even get channeling if the surface is too high - immediately below the holes where water comes out it might dig a channel into your puck. If you can see dots on your puck after taking it out, it's probably channeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wet puck in general also suggest too much coffee or too fine of a grind, check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y-EYGSOU7I" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this life hack from James Hoffmann&lt;/a&gt;, where he suggests letting the espresso run for a little longer so you can knock it out of the portafilter more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Inconsistent Espresso</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've got a Lelit Anita with PID (PL42TEMD). The machine is new, about 3 weeks old now. It's used for 2 people to make coffee in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, settings are 93 degrees on the PID, grind around 3 (a nudge above). 15.5g ground beans in for 30s/ 30g out. No tamping, only distributing with a distributer. Backpressure sits around 11 bar at the end of the green zone on the gauge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That works well for the first shot I pull, it's dialled in so to speak. Taste is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second shot, prepared the same way, at 93 degrees, 15.5g grounds in, distributed comes out way faster, usually after 20s I've got the 30g of coffee in the cup. Backpressure is lower too by a bar and a bit, which is expected with higher flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is beyond me because the same coffee puck should result in the same coffee flow, which is not happening and I cannot understand why. Dose is the same, grind is the same, packing is the same, temperature is the same yet the espressos are wildly different between coffees 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I leave the machine alone for 20 minutes while drinking this coffee and make another set of 2 coffees, I experience the same fluctuation again, first shot fine, second shot fast. What the heck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No tamping&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start tamping your coffee. Without tamping channels form a lot easier, making your shot pour a lot faster and making your coffee taste sour and bitter at the same time. If you still manage to get 11 bars of pressure somehow without tamping, I'd assume your coffee is ground way too fine anyways, making it even more likely to form channels since they offer less resistance than the puck itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the first shot flows slower than the second one probably boils (no pun intended) down to a colder brew head. If you're not doing this already try flushing your brew head and portafilter to get them hot (so hot you barely manage to hold it for a few seconds) before pulling a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Stability of Chemex Filter</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When I am brewing with my Chemex, most always the filter begins to drag down along the inside, and I always have to use my fingers to pull it back and re-balance the filter. I have tried regular Grocery Store filters (don't remember the brand name), and now I am using Chemex brand filters. Am I doing something wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also tried mimicking techniques I see online, they bring up the issue of the filter insulating the Chemex and not allowing open flow; however I have never seen anyone address the issue I face. I would also be willing to change to a Chemex-adjacent piece if it would mean avoiding this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is a common problem I experience with my Chemex as well. My advice is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-wet your Chemex (brand) filter while it's in the Chemex. While doing this make sure it's flat against the Chemex walls, this helps to create a &amp;quot;seal&amp;quot; that prevents the filter from falling. Be careful not to push it into the spout during this process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I usually stir my pour-overs during the bloom, if you push too harshly down on the coffee during this step, it will also drag the filter down as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check down the spout throughout the brew. If you can see a gap you're probably okay. If not you can lift up a bit to reset the filter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comment is correct as well, ensure the 3-ply part of the filter is over the spout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all this doesn't work, I've also seen Ray from &lt;a href="https://melodrip.co/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;melodrip&lt;/a&gt; fold the filters over the sides of the Chemex, to help keep it from falling. Be careful to not block off the spout while doing this as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Are there any tools to help filling the moka pot with coffee and prevent wasting coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;While preparing coffee in my 2-cup moka pot, I usually try to carefully sprinkle ground coffee from my grinder into the funnel of my pot. When I reach approximately the amount of coffee needed to fill it, I use a knife with a straight spine to level and tip off any excess coffee, which usually wastes some of the coffee, as it tends to fall everywhere around the funnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any tools that can make this process cleaner?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Short answer is no, though you can use a common kitchen scale to minimize (but not eliminate) waste. Measure in grams if you're not already and if your scale supports it for greater precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basket on your pot has a fixed volume. Coffee within a particular roast batch will also have fairly consistent density. This means that you should be able to use very nearly the same &amp;quot;weight&amp;quot; of coffee per brew. Measure your coffee with a kitchen scale to get an idea of how much it takes to fill the basket, then in the future grind or scoop that amount in weight including the excess you will later level off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveling off is important. If you don't level off your basket with a moka pot, you'll significantly increase the volume of steam required to produce enough pressure to push the coffee up the tube. That's bad because it'll add some variables into your brew routine that are impossible to control. Use more heat or brew longer to get more steam and you could burn your coffee, but because you wouldn't get the same surface distribution with each brew, the amount of steam you need would change per brew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So look at it like this: dumping 1ish gram of coffee grounds per brew is not nearly as bad as dumping an entire dose because you ruined your brew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're really worried about dumping that bit, get yourself an airtight food canister and use it to store leftover grounds for your next brew. That coffee will go stale right quick, but since it's such a small amount, it won't dramatically affect the next brew regardless. Waste nothing if you save what you level off!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>DeLonghi Magnifica ESAM3500 brews for too long</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My machine is a DeLonghi Magnifica ESAM3500 , though this may apply to other models as well.
It all started after I ran a descaling cycle on an otherwise faultless machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee would drip during the pre-infusion phase of brewing, then stop and continue brewing,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too much coffee is brewed to the point of overflowing your cups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rinsing cycle at power on/off takes too long and too much water is poured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say the coffee tastes like crap.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The solution was to replace the flowmeter (picture is of a different machine but the position of the sensor is the same):
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j47Rv.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j47Rv.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the part in detail:

&lt;p&gt;In my case there was corrosion on the connector that was causing the sensor to malfunction, the chrome-plating on the lower part of the connector (the one that goes into the sensor) was eaten by the corrosion, this is how it looks after cleaning with WD40:

&lt;p&gt;I ended up replacing the whole sensor with a spare that i got from a friend that's into buying used/broken machines and refurbishing them for sale. Otherwise you can get them from ebay by searching for &amp;quot;delonghi esam flow-meter&amp;quot; and making sure what you buy looks exactly like the picture above.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How does espresso-based coffee compare to instant coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When I buy coffee from outside, from whatever popular brand outside, and drink it, I feel a bit elevated. Especially one with higher caffeine content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I drink the one I make my own I feel a bit more neutral/ have a headache depending on how much instant coffee powder I use. I am so confused on this because to my understanding, both the restaurant and I are using more or less the same ingredient: Coffee beans. So why does one lead me to be elated while the other gives me a headache?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my preparation currently: Powder and sugar in cup, hot milk in, mix to serve. Definitely not the most sophisticated kind of preparation but I think the chemical composition of the ultimate product should be comparable, hence the effect of drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm aware of &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/5535"&gt;Why are Costa or Starbucks lattes so good?&lt;/a&gt;, though that question is aimed at improving coffee at home. In this question, I'm interested in a comparison of instant coffee and espresso-based coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Instant coffee is coffee that has already been brewed then cooled and underwent a process that leaves only the solids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instant coffee is usually made of cheaper robusta beans (high quality robusta beans also used in Italian espresso blends to give specific flavors). Robusta also has more caffeine content than Arabica, but instant coffee has &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/FO/C4FO00290C#!divAbstract" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;less caffeine&lt;/a&gt; than a coffee brewed from the same beans using other methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Espresso yields a brew that will be more complex and a more satisfactory sensatory experience (how can you resist the smell of a espresso being brewed, that alone has more kick that the caffeine itself!). Instant coffee on the other hand is practical and quick to prepare, espresso forces you to focus on the preparation process and let's you try different parameters (grind size, amount of coffee, temperature, extraction pressure and time) to get your ideal brew.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Does which grind setting you use also depend on the beans used?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So - I use an automatic bean-to-cup espresso machine. The grinder within the machine has 5 grind levels - 5 being the most coarse, 1 being the most fine. Out of the box, it was pre-set to 3, which did absolutely fine with the beans I initially used. But I've noticed recently that some of the cups have been really sour, and tasted as though they have been under-extracted. After changing the grind setting to 1 with the recent beans I was using, it tastes just fine again. Is it in my head or does the grind setting you should use really also depend on the beans you are using? If so, I am intrigued, why?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's not just your head! Different roast batches will benefit from different grind settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, this is partly because different roast levels will result in beans that contain different compounds. This is because the heat or roasting causes chemical changes in some of the bean's compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, roasting causes water in the bean to boil off as steam. This process both affects the durability of the bean and the actual structure of the bean. First, a drier bean (resulting from a darker roast) is more brittle and is more likely to shatter, producing fines, during grinding. Second, the process of rapid boiling of the bean's water content caused a buildup of pressure inside the bean which makes beans &amp;quot;pop&amp;quot; during roasting, much like popcorn (but with coffee we call it &amp;quot;cracking&amp;quot;). Dark roasts tend to undergo two cracks during roasting, while light and medium roasts undergo one or stretch just into the beginning of the second crack. This process of crafting the bean create channels in the bean that expose more surface area in darker roasts right out of the roast, without any grinding at all. This structural change contributes further to the frailty of the beans and the likelihood of shattering during grinding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the reason why you see polar opposite recommendations from various coffee pros on how to grind light vs dark roasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People actually disagree on whether to grind light roasts more finely or coarsely than dark roasts. I don't want to suggest either approach. Rather, I just mean to explain that due to natural differences between bean harvests and differences introduced to roast batches via the cleaning, drying, and roasting processes, no two batches of coffee are quite the same. The differences become less pronounced with &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; dark roasts like you often find in coffee shops in the US, but when buying smaller batch coffee at home that isn't roasted quite so dark, you'll often find that two bags of the same brand and blend bought on the same day with the same roast date aren't &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the same and the one bag might do better with minor adjustments to your grinder between bags. And sometimes, especially when moving from one brand or blend to another, you'll see vast differences in your brew process using the same grind setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, which grind setting you use depends on the beans you're using. Unfortunately, there's no great way to tell what grind setting to use until you do your first brew and observe the differences from what you expect. Just don't be surprised if you see big differences between bags or especially between brands/varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is brewing coffee with milk instead of water a bad idea? And if so, how bad is it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I remember a Friday night kitchen experiment when I mixed very hot low-fat milk with coffee powder and partially ran it through a paper filter. Many of the complex, high-molecular milk components didn't make it through the filter, so they blocked the whole surface leading to only small volume of bright-brownish liquid in the container. But I also remember that the taste was extremely smooth and new to me. In another test, I would like to use a french press with milk instead of water... Does anyone here has experience with milk-brewed coffee?&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Are specific roasts or blends better for making cold brew at home?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm new to making my own cold brew at home. When making hot coffee I tend to buy darker roasts or espresso blends because they are less acidic. I assume the same rules apply for cold brew, but I was curious if there is a better/preferred type of bean or roast if the go is a low acidic taste.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are many variables that affect the final cup (in any type of brewing):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brewing technique (even with cold brew you can change factors like grind size, steeping in the fridge or at room temperature, brew time, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of roast (as you say lighter versus darker roasts)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of bean (different origins and how the bean was processed from a fruit to a green bean)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="type-of-bean-ay0k"&gt;Type of bean&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the type of bean. Some origins are more acidic than others. One indicator is the altitude at which the coffee is grown: a higher altitude results in a more acidic bean, which generally leads to more complex fruity flavors. According to &lt;a href="https://perfectdailygrind.com/2015/06/how-does-altitude-affect-coffee-and-its-taste-in-the-cup/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a blog by perfectdailygrind&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason that higher elevation coffee is more sought after is the taste. When well-cared for, high elevation coffee will produce the more acidic, aromatic and flavorful cup of coffee that we love, while lower elevation coffee tends to have a lower acidity with little character in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want less acidity, you might want to consider beans cultivated at lower elevation. Two low altitude beans are &lt;a href="https://dailycoffeenews.com/2019/04/18/the-fascinating-history-and-renewal-of-brazils-yellow-bourbon/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brazil's Yellow Bourbon&lt;/a&gt; (also popular as a bean for espresso) and &lt;a href="https://www.konacoffeeandtea.com/blog/kona-coffee-tasting-notes-2019" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kona coffee from Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; (quite expensive and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kona_coffee#Kona_blends" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;there may be blends with a high proportion of other beans mixed in&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there's the aspect of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production#Dry_process" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;natural processed&lt;/a&gt; versus &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production#Wet_process" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;washed&lt;/a&gt;. Washed coffees are more widely available and &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/181"&gt;they are also less acidic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="type-of-roast-a115"&gt;Type of roast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the darker the roast the more pronounced the bitter flavors will prevail over the acidic flavors. Nevertheless, choosing a dark roast means you will mostly taste the flavors determined by the roast rather than the ones acquired by growing the bean. If you want to have some variety, I would suggest looking for medium roasts so different origins provide different taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="brewing-technique-1vmp"&gt;Brewing technique&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As indicated in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1673"&gt;an answer to this question about roast levels and cold brew&lt;/a&gt;, cold brew produces a less acidic cup compared to hot brewing methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold brew produces a more muddled mixture of flavors and relies more on mouthfeel and big flavors like sweetness, savory, earth, chocolate, etc. More delicate precise flavors are lost. It is also important to note that some fruit, vegetal, and herbal flavors are enhanced by the presence of acid, like adding lemon juice and tarragon to a fish filet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you are trying to avoid acid but you love the fruitiness of say, a medium roasted Kenyan single origin, you could cold brew it and see if you still get the flavors you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for brewing time, I think 18 hours at room temperature is a good starting point. According to this guide by &lt;a href="https://www.homegrounds.co/how-long-to-steep-cold-brew/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;homegrounds.co&lt;/a&gt; increasing the time risks getting an overly bitter result while a much shorter extraction can yield a weak cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grind size is one of the factors that you can play with to change the bitterness / acidity tradeoff after you've settled on a particular coffee. The finer you grind, the more you favor bitter flavors over acidity. Remember though that you don't want too grind too fine as that will clog up your filter (regardless of the system you are using) and it might produce a muddy result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brew ratios are about the ratio of coffee beans to water. &lt;a href="https://www.northstarroast.com/cold-brew-coffee/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;North Star roasters recommend&lt;/a&gt; are ration of 1:8 which is one part coffee beans / grinds to 8 parts water (by weight). They describe more concentrated ratios but they mention that affects brew time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I think you can get to an enjoyable cup by focusing on just two variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing the roasted beans. As stated before, there is less variability if you stick to darker roasts. With medium roasts the taste will differ more based on origin and growing conditions. Beans from Brazil are commonly available and I think they are a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Varying the grind size to finetune. Once you've settled on a bag of beans this is probably the factor to focus on. If you keep everything else the same (the same beans, the same brew time, etc.) then you can increase or decrease the bitterness by grinding coarser or finer, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Is 15 bar necessary for espresso?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I think I read that in order to get a good espresso the espresso machine has to be able to (I may be wrong):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide constant 9 bar pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;must be able to provide water at constant high temperature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I see many espresso machines in Amazon and a myriad of other places that are marketed as &amp;quot;15 bar&amp;quot; machine, or even &amp;quot;20 bar&amp;quot; machine. For example, I can find the &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B001CNG7RY" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;De'Longhi 15 bar Pump Espresso Maker, EC702, Metal&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B08RYPGQ5W" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gevi Espresso Machines 20 Bar Fast Heating Automatic Cappuccino Coffee Maker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is 15 bar or 20 bar a good thing to have, compared to 9 bar?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I think these are mostly marketing terms. What they're saying in those ads is that the machine has a pump that is able to provide 15 bar (or more on in some cases) of pressure. In practice, the pump pressure should be a bit more than the pressure you want to brew at so that you can reach and maintain that pressure when brewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a stronger pump isn't a bad thing (and it may be the standard because of other use cases for those pumps; I'm not sure) but it's not going to give you any benefits. It's a bit like having a race car in traffic, it won't hurt but you're not going to go faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 9 bar figure you're referring to is commonly cited as an ideal brew pressure. For example, James Hoffmann mentions it in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/po3oGIicu-8" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;his video&lt;/a&gt; on pressure for espresso brewing. He describes it as an ideal brewing pressure because of the associated flow rate which depends on the amount of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the 9 bar figure isn't set in stone, there's definitely room for experimentation, possibly by changing the pressure during the brew (assuming the equipment supports that). An &lt;a href="https://www.baristamagazine.com/changing-espresso-extraction-with-scott-rao/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;article in Barista Magazine&lt;/a&gt; describes Scott Rao's experimentation with pressure profiling. He had good results with a long pre-infusion where pressure increases slowly, peaking  at 9 bar followed by a slow drop in pressure. With a 60+ second extraction and 25% more solubles, he got positive feedback. One of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEXLftYYV8o" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;experiments was also featured in a James Hoffmann video back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is 15 bar or 20 bar a good thing to have, compared to 9 bar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer the question directly, I don't think it hurts (or benefits) to have that high pump pressure. As a brewing temperature though, I don't think it's used much. As explained in the first video I linked, too much pressure may further compress the coffee puck in a way that may harm the flow of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Merriam Webster definition of coffee"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: a beverage made by percolation, infusion, or decoction from the roasted and ground seeds of a coffee plant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pre-Question Banter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered, &amp;quot;If coffee is made from, well, &lt;a href="https://www.cameronscoffee.com/blog/did-you-know-coffee-isnt-really-a-bean/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Coffee beans are actually pits"&gt;coffee beans&lt;/a&gt;, why not make it from peanuts? Or pistachios, or lentils, or peppercorn?&amp;quot; If coffee is made from roasting the pit of a specific type of &lt;a href="https://coffeechronicler.com/coffee-cherry-taste/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Coffee is from the pit of a cherry"&gt;cherry&lt;/a&gt; to the desired level, grinding it to a desired level of coarseness, and then running hot water over it, it seems to me that most other seeds, legumes, nuts, etc. can undergo the same magical operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold: &lt;a href="https://vagold.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Virginia Gold Peanut Coffee"&gt;peanut coffee&lt;/a&gt;. However, this is the only coffee alternative I found. I have found the existence of drinks &lt;em&gt;infused&lt;/em&gt; with flavors such as pistachio-infused coffee, or the infamous pumpkin spice latte, but I have yet to find a drink brewed &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; anything other than roasted coffee pits or roasted peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Question:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it possible to use the coffee brewing method on other foods and yet preserve/enhance the food's flavor, creating a drink?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't need to know whether we can roast similar foods to open up a new world of coffee since I already know we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about foods other than the before mention types? To specify, any food that isn't a seed, pit, nut, legume, or anything similar to those. Can we roast, grind, and brew other foods to concoct a previously unforeseen beverage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With something like banana chips, I believe the natural coating of sugar would prevent the water from effectively absorbing flavor. What about vegetables?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about meat? It should be known to many that charring food actually enhances its flavor. But, as I have learned in researching this, there is a &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cooked-meats-fact-sheet" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Cancer risks of consuming charred meat"&gt;cancer risk in charred meat&lt;/a&gt;. So, are there other ways we can extract the flavor from meat to make some kind of weird meat coffee? And of course, do this abiding by the traditional process of brewing coffee, or else this question wouldn't belong here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe my question is more of a chemistry question, however, it doesn't belong on the Chem Stack (to my knowledge, although I'm likely wrong here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show what I mean by this here is an overly shortened example of the kind of answer I would expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, you cannot. Due to [insert chemical reaction], the food would effectively turn into poison.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Your thoughts are neither new nor unheard of. Coffee as a product has always been a luxury item in most parts of the world, so consumers have been creative in finding substitutes for the real deal from the start. They were and still are prepared both at home and sold as commercial products. There are also coffee-and-substitutes mixes, stretching the yield of the coveted real coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few decades especially cereal coffee made a bit of a comeback in organic food stores in Europe (can’t speak for the US), with multiple major brands throwing one or even multiple blends on the market, and successfully so.  Btw., all that started when kale was still considered a winter vegetable meant to be cooked to a mush and served with bacon or sausages, not a “superfood” to be thrown in a blender raw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common ingredients for coffee substitutes include &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;grains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (barley, spelt, rice), &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;roots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (chicory, dandelion), &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nuts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;seeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (acorns), &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fruit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (dates) and a bunch of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (molasses). As they typically don’t contain caffeine, they are still used by some consumers that want a coffee-like drink but can’t or don’t want to drink real coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in short, the answer to your main question is: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, it’s quite possible (and in a way even “traditional”) to roast other food items beyond coffee to make a drink appreciated by some consumers.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether it would be truly unheard of remains questionable, especially as lots of others have experimented on the topic for centuries - and likely found many raw materials unsuitable for the desired goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend you start reading &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_substitute" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_substitute" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of this post remains limited to what this site’s scope is - if that’s not sufficient for you, I’m afraid that the question is too broad and more of an invitation for a discussion and less of a clear question in the SE sense.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Espresso with little bitterness</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I really like espresso, but the variant I like most is different from what most cafes serve: I like it best if the espresso is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;really dense (so not like filter coffee at all),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has little bitterness, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a lot of acidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I simply have bad taste, or is the espresso I describe a &amp;quot;real thing&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, do you have recommendations how to make the espresso I describe for myself at home? I only had it at a few cafes, and I was never able to reproduce it at home. I own a portafiler machine, so I guess the problem is most likely the beans I use (high quality espresso beans, medium dark roast).&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;For acidity, you want espresso made with a light roast. Caffes in the US generally don't serve this because it's not what people expect from coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dense&amp;quot;, though, is a challenge. I'm not sure what you mean by this because espresso is mostly water. A nice layer of crema can create the perception of a heavy drink, but crema isn't dense. It's all water and gasses. Use freshly roasted beans to get better crema. With light roasts, you want beans that are about 2-4 weeks past roasting if the beans are left whole. Ground coffee will degas much faster than whole bean. Store your coffee in an airtight container with a one-way gas valve (to release pressure that builds up as the coffee releases gasses).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the process of coffee acting as a taste blocker in conjunction with menthol/mint</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Background, I vape a mint (spearmint and peppermint) with menthol. When I drink any kind of coffee and for some time after, the vape has a different (not so nice) taste. It can be black coffee, something fancy from a coffee shop, or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me wondering, what is the chemical process that is going on here. Is there something about coffee that binds to some taste receptors? If so which ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am casually interested in the science of what is happening in my mouth when I drink coffee as evidenced by changes in flavours of something else.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Conflicting information regarding caffeine content in an espresso?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/171890/nutrients" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the USDA&lt;/a&gt;, the caffeine content in 100 gram of brewed coffee is about 40 milligram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/171891/nutrients" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the USDA&lt;/a&gt;, 100 ?gram of restaurant-prepared espresso contains 212 milligram of caffeine. That means one gram of espresso contains about 2.12 ?milligram of caffeine.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://coffee.org/pages/caffeine-levels-in-coffee-how-much-caffeine-in-coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;coffee.org&lt;/a&gt;, a single coffee bean contains 1.9 milligram of caffeine on average, which translates to 1.2-1.5 gram caffeine per 100 gram of beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems these numbers don't match up. Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of things to consider regarding these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a coffee perspective, it's important to note the difference between caffeine in the bean and caffeine in the coffee drink brewed from those beans. When you extract liquid coffee from grounds you extract some, but not all elements. Caffeine extraction, for example differs based on the brew method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the USDA links in the question show, &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/171891/nutrients" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;100g of espresso&lt;/a&gt; contains 212mg of caffeine while &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/171890/nutrients" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;100g of brewed coffee&lt;/a&gt; contains only 40mg of caffeine. That is because espresso is brewed under pressure, which allows more elements to be extracted from the coffee bean using less water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, to make 100g of espresso you would use much more coffee grounds than you would when brewing 100g of brewed coffee. You might be brewing espresso with a brew ratio of 1:2 (15g of grounds to get 30g of liquid espresso) while 1:16 is a good ratio for filter coffee. In that sense, espresso is just more concentrated, with respect to caffeine but it goes for other solubles (particles in the coffee bean which you extract into the coffee liquid) too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be said that coffee isn't an exact science. Caffeine content can vary slightly per bean (that's why &lt;a href="https://coffee.org/pages/caffeine-levels-in-coffee-how-much-caffeine-in-coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;coffee.org&lt;/a&gt; lists the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; figures). And another variable that may affect caffeine extraction is the brewing process. Just like different brew parameters (temperature, grind size, pressure, etc.) can affect espresso flavor, they might also affect caffeine extraction. I'm not claiming that any of these brew parameters affect caffeine extraction specifically, but they might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a language perspective, there might be some confusion about the description on &lt;a href="https://coffee.org/pages/caffeine-levels-in-coffee-how-much-caffeine-in-coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;coffee.org&lt;/a&gt;. They describe caffeine content in the average arabica bean as well as the content per 100g of beans. One bean weighs less than one gram, so it might cause confusion. They provide the following figures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.9mg of caffeine per bean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.2-1.5g of caffeine per 100g of beans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the average of 1.35g of caffeine per 100g of beans, we find there are about 1.35*1000/1.9 = 710 beans in 100 gram of beans.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Did I mess up the grinder settings when adjusting the grind size when the grinder was not in use?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I bought Phillips LatteGo 3200 machine. When it came, I put it together and during that I noticed there is a grinder coarseness knob. Out of stupidity, I tried to move it up and down. Then I read in the manual that you can only change grinder level while the grinder is in use, during the actual grinding process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I wonder, did I brake anything when I moved the knob while the grinder was not running? Is there some setting linked to the knob position I messed up, and if so, is there a way to fix it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You probably didn't break the machine when adjusting the grind setting when the grinder wasn't in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this recommendation is that there might be a bean which is stuck between the grind disks. If you try to adjust the grind setting with a bean stuck in between then you might need a lot of force which the adjusting mechanism isn't built for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try to adjust it and it and everything moves without too much resistance then there is probably no bean stuck in between and adjusting shouldn't harm the machine. If it feels like the knob is stuck when you try to adjust it then it makes sense to turn on the grinder so that the beans blocking the disks will be pulverized as you adjust the setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, adjusting the grind setting with partially ground beans between the burrs can transfer pressure to the adjusting mechanism. Even if that doesn't break the system, it can wear some parts out faster. This reasoning is given &lt;a href="https://baratza.com/purging-while-adjusting/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;by Baratza&lt;/a&gt; who make burr grinders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also recommend, when using a Baratza grinder, that you grind coffee through the machine while adjusting your grind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back inside that machine again to better understand why we do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grind size is regulated by the distance between each burr. If you’ve got an empty machine, these burrs can move closer or farther apart unobstructed. When coffee is in the system (especially partially ground coffee retained between the burrs), moving the burrs closer together will press down on that ground coffee. This creates resistance against the burrs which transfers to the adjustment system. The result of this kind of use is a shorter lifespan of the adjustment assembly, leading to more frequent repairs.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Stirring Nescafe before filling the mug</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;For several year now I've been making the instant coffee (e.g. Nescafe) as follows: after putting a spoon of coffee I add boiling water just to cover the coffee and stir it with spoon or electrical stirrer. Only after this I fill up the mug and drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my question is: what's the difference (if any) between this method and just filling up the mug with boiling water then stir and drink?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/5631/1118"&gt;this question and the experiment it prompted&lt;/a&gt;, I’d say no difference whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one small caveat, though: if you happen to have a brand of instant coffee that doesn’t dissolve well, then, and only then, your two-step method may help to avoid any lumps. I have never had any problems, except for once when I had a jar well past its prime where the contents had become somewhat lumpy.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Espresso Not Coming Out While Pump Turned On</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just purchased a used Gaggia Espresso Color (not sure how long it's been used nor maintenance) and am running into an issue (doesn't happen every time) where when I turn on the pump to pull a shot you can hear the pump on and working but no espresso comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 20-30 seconds the sound from the pump becomes quieter. But, if I turn the pump off for a few seconds and then turn it back on espresso does start coming out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first time making espresso so not sure if it's user error or an issue with my used machine. I just ordered some descaler online to descale it as I'm assuming the machine hasn't had much maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference I'm using a medium roast and a Baratza Virtuoso grinder.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Some things to try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, run the pump briefly with no portafilter in place. You should see a nice shower of water flow from the brew group. If you don't see a nice shower flowing, the shower screen on the portafilter might be clogged (or there might be a partial clog elsewhere in the system). If this is the problem, clean your shower screen, then do a backflush routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your grind size might be too fine. If there is no sign from a leak above but your spent pucks come out soupy, this could be your problem. Dial the grind down a tick or two and try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pump might be dying. This unit uses a vibration pump, a type of pump that is susceptible to failure but also easy to replace if it fails. A damaged pump might not produce sufficient pressure to drive water through your coffee. If you increase your grind size to get good flow but then get weak tasting brews with no crema, the pump might be to blame. Contact Gaggia support for information on purchasing a replacement part and how to do the repair if this is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are low-maintenance and plastic-free options for making coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;We threw out our drip machine because we’re trying to ditch plastic. Got a Paderno moka pot, and didn’t take long for rust to cover the bottom. Probably because we like to prep the coffee the night before and we hadn’t been drying the water container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m considering a percolator. Can you leave water in a stainless steel percolator without it rusting? The moka pot was supposed to be stainless steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main focus is to reduce consumptive exposure to plastics.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;A French Press lasts forever. Or until you drop it, whichever comes first. I have a stainless steel thermos French Press which is bullet proof and keeps coffee warm for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you could be a minimalist and make Camp Coffee: just pour boiling water onto loose grounds, like making tea. A dollop of cold water will sink (most) of the grounds to the bottom of the pot (or mug). It helps to grow a moustache to strain the odd grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>original taste of coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Coffee is a sensitive object.  Storing coffee in the wrong place and in the wrong way will change its original taste and freshness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people may often buy coffee in large quantities to stock up for months.  Even though he doesn't know that coffee that has been stored for months (both ground and beans) will change the taste, freshness of the coffee and worst of all it will cause your coffee to go stale.  Then how should you store coffee so that its freshness is maintained?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;How to store coffee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put coffee in an airtight container and freeze it. Thaw only what you will use in the next week. While thawing frozen beans, keep them in an airtight container so moisture doesn’t condense on them. Once up to room temperature, keep them in  an air tight container until use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we perceive as “taste” is really mostly smell. With coffee, this is provided by volatile (means easily evaporated, as opposed to flammable) chemicals. Like alcohols, aldehydes, esters, furans… They evaporate easily, forming equilibrium between their gaseous state and the bound state in the beans.  The higher the temperature, the more these volatiles will favor the gaseous state. If you store coffee in an unsealed container at room temperature (like the hopper of your coffee grinder) these yummy vapors dissipate, leaving the coffee relatively flavorless. If they are in a sealed container, they can’t go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of non-volatile chemicals which give coffee its flavor as well (carbohydrates, lipids, organic acids, etc). They are not volatile, so they aren’t going to leave the coffee as vapor. But even if they don’t evaporate, they can oxidize. Oxidation means chemical reaction with oxygen. As a rule, chemical reactions double in speed every 10*C increase in temperature. That’s why coffee flavor is preserved longer in the freezer than at room temperature. You can also reduce oxidation by reducing oxygen. Ideally, a coffee container should be purged with an inert gas like Nitrogen, CO2  or Argon before closing it. But not even I am fanatical enough to bother. Fortunately, commercially packaged coffee bags are self-purging. Coffee off-gasses (mostly CO2) after roasting. That little button on your coffee bag is a vent to let gas out so the bag doesn’t blow up like a balloon. This venting displaces most of the oxygen that was trapped in the bag before it was sealed. That’s why commercially packaged coffee has a reasonable shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My routine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy whole coffee beans in sealed multi-layer bags with a vent button. Never buy coffee from an unsealed bin unless you are buying direct from a roaster. If they can’t tell you the day the beans were roasted, don’t buy them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediately freeze any coffee which will not be used within a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the multilayer bag is opened, dump the beans into a ZipLoc, expel the air and return to the freezer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thaw beans in a sealed container. Those old fashioned wire-rimmed snap-top glass jars work great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When grinding, remove only beans you will use immediately and re-seal the container. Don’t keep beans in the grinder hopper. It isn’t air-tight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Baristas who have been mind-melted by Starbucks will tell you it is bad to freeze coffee. Rubbish. Starbucks doesn’t want to pay for a cold chain or maintain fresh stock, so they store bagged coffee at room temperature for up to 34 weeks, That is over half a year !! &lt;a href="https://athome.starbucks.com/helping-keep-coffee-fresh" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://athome.starbucks.com/helping-keep-coffee-fresh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some buzz about grinding frozen beans. The reason for the buzz is that a study showed that grinding REALLY COLD beans (liquid nitrogen temperature, not deep freeze temperature) produces a smaller, more uniform particle size. This may be relevant for industrial grinders, but not at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: grinding frozen beans will produce a finer grind for a given setting on your grinder. If you have found the “perfect setting”, tweak it a bit courser if you are grinding frozen beans. The cold coffee will get some moisture condensation and the coffee will be “clumpy”. You may need to disassemble and clean your grinder more often. I think it’s better to wait for the beans to warm to room temperature before grinding.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Do all burr grinders statically-charge the grinds?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Do all burr grinders statically-electrically–charge the grinds, or do only the faster-operating ones do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krups GVX212 burr grinders &lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0001I9R8W/#reviews-image-gallery-container" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;are notorious&lt;/a&gt; for producing statically-charged grinds that stick to the plastic hopper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do all electric burr grinders produce statically-charged grinds, or does it depend upon the grind speed* or other factors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*The Krups GVX212 does 20g in ~30 seconds.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes, &amp;quot;Different grinders, coffees, and environments may produce more or less static&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://clivecoffee.com/blogs/learn/reducing-static-in-your-grinder" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Reducing Static in your Grinder&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAgWc-RW8XU" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Stop Coffee Grinder Static with RDT&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;you'll get more static during the drier months or with darker roasted and therefore drier beans&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.home-barista.com/grinders/ross-droplet-technique-eliminating-grinder-static-t24051.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Ross Droplet Technique (RDT)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; was pioneered in 2005. Basically, you stir the beans in or spray them with a small amount of water, immediately before grinding. The water reduces static but does not clog the grinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee grinds are insulators. There are several methods of discharging insulators (&lt;a href="https://www.ifi.unicamp.br/%7Eassis/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Assis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ifi.unicamp.br/%7Eassis/Electricity.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimental and Historical Foundations of Electricity&lt;/em&gt; vol. 1&lt;/a&gt;, §7.14 &amp;quot;How to Discharge an Electrified Insulator?&amp;quot;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait. The insulator will discharge over time. (&lt;a href="https://www.ifi.unicamp.br/%7Eassis/Electricity.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Experiment 7.29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submerse the insulator in water. (&lt;a href="https://www.ifi.unicamp.br/%7Eassis/Electricity.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Experiment 7.30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hold a flame near the insulator. (&lt;a href="https://www.ifi.unicamp.br/%7Eassis/Electricity.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Experiment 7.31, first discovered by the physicist &lt;a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/medicine/medicine-biographies/william-gilbert" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;William Gilbert&lt;/a&gt;, 1544-1603)&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>What happens when you brew coffee for a long time and/or on a high temperature (above 100°C)?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Does anybody know, what happens, when you brew coffee for a long time and/or on a high temperature (above 100°C). I found only this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205°F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not care about the taste of coffee, I am interested only in its health benefits. I would like to understand exactly how the coffee changes its chemical composition when you brew it at 100 + ° C for 10-20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You can’t brew coffee at 100+C since water boils at 100C and won’t get any hotter if you crank up the heat. It boils faster, but doesn’t get hotter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course you live beside the Dead Sea or in a hyperbaric chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boiling has little effect on the chemical composition of coffee. It has already been exposed to 220C in the roasting process so any chemical bonds fragile enough to react at 100C are long gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Health benefits” of coffee are minimal. Coffee drinkers have a slightly lower incidence of bowel cancer. This is likely due to caffeine moving things along in the bowel faster. Caffeine content will not be affected by boiling. Coffee is drunk for yummy taste and caffeine buzz, not for health benefits. Unfortunately, caffeine is classified as a food additive (rather than as a drug) so it can be added to “Energy Drinks” (sugar syrup + caffeine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flavorful components of coffee tend to be extracted early in the process and the bitter components later. That’s why espresso (= “fast” in Italian) has surprisingly little bitterness considering the strength of its flavor. If you are boiling coffee for 20 minutes, I bet it is a bitter brew.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>When do you know coffee beans are over roasted or burnt?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When coffee beans or ground coffee smells bitter is this always a sign that they are over roasted / burnt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I prepare coffee with these beans in French press it tastes bitter - the residual after taste is bitter - the initial taste is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When do you know coffee beans are over roasted or burnt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When coffee is roasted beyond the &amp;quot;second crack&amp;quot;, it completely loses all its origin characteristics, and tastes bitter. If the roasted beans look oily and shiny, they are most probably roasted too dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When coffee beans or ground coffee smells bitter is this always a sign that they are over roasted / burnt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately no, bitter coffee can also mean overextraction. This can be mitigated by using colder water, shorter brew time, less stirring or (the best solution) grinding the coffee coarser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I prepare coffee with these beans in French press it tastes bitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <title>Recipes yield horrible coffee with the Aeropress</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;First, I've a few personal constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have to drink decaf (was in hospital because of caffeine).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm traveling a lot, so no grinder, no scale, I rely on store ground coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically I buy the Lavazza DEK:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e6T81.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e6T81.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When at home, where I have a scale, but no grinder, I have tried to follow a few recipes from competitions. I've also tried to follow &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VlT_jUVPc&amp;amp;t=144s" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;James Hoffman's &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Ultimate Aeropress recipe&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, all with that coffee and they all taste bitter and thin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to make very nice coffee with it but it always takes very little water and very short steep time. All these recipes that call for a lot of water and long steep times taste awful with that specific coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that it has to do with the grind which is just not compatible with these recipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to grind size, for example the James Hoffman recipe says &amp;quot;ground at the finer end of medium&amp;quot;... but what is 'medium'?
Is there a real scale for this? How can I know where the coffee I buy stands when it comes to grind size?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, is it possible that the pre-ground coffee has an inconsistent grinding size? or could it be that decaf has to be brewed differently?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;These are good hypotheses. These topics depend on personal taste so I'll include personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let me say that I find the &lt;a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0601/8783/6659/files/AreoPress-ENG.pdf?v=1637168529" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;AeroPress manufacturer's (current) instructions&lt;/a&gt; to produce excellent coffee -- tastier and more easily than all the other brewing recipes I've tried, including James Hoffman's. Please do try theirs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;paper filter
1 scoop fine drip grind coffee
1/4 cup 175°F water
stir 10 seconds
press
to taste: add 3/4 cup water for coffee or 3/4 cup milk for latte
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly I do not know why people go to great lengths to do slow brewing, upside down brewing, and other dances. Longer brewing, more water, and/or hotter water are expected to cause bitter &amp;quot;overextraction.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their instructions now say to add water up to (1), which is 1/4 cup. This &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;bypass brewing&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; approach tastes better to me than their older recipe which said to add water to (2) [1/2 cup], and it tastes a LOT better than pushing all the water [1 cup] through the AeroPress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;a href="https://aeropress.com/pages/faq" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;their FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, they point out that the tawny crema might come out bitter. In my experience, AeroPress hot brew has somewhat bitter crema while the (awesome) AeroPress cold brew recipe has crema that I like.&lt;br /&gt;
So try this: Press the water through the AeroPress, then press the air into the sink and taste the crema that's comes out through the cap. Keep it if and only if you like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FAQ also recommends using paper filters because those always won their taste tests over metal filters and they filter out diterpenes which raise your bad cholesterol levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About your other hypotheses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my limited experimentation, AeroPress is relatively insensitive to grind size and water temperature (because of the immersion method?). I don't find a scale is needed; I just put 1 level scoop of beans in the grinder at a &amp;quot;fine&amp;quot; grind level or 1 rounded scoop of beans at a &amp;quot;medium&amp;quot; grind size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decaf coffee can taste great. Really! But you have to find beans that you like, just like with caffeinated beans except there are fewer choices. I get good results from small roasters, possibly because they take more care to tune the process and timing for each batch. Trader Joe's and Starbucks &amp;quot;reserve blends&amp;quot; have also been OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have no experience with LaVazza DEK coffee. The freshness might matter a lot since pre-ground beans are oxidizing faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://thecoffeefolk.com/complete-guide-coffee-grinding/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Coffee Folk website has a coffee grind chart&lt;/a&gt; with photos to help explain. They describe &amp;quot;fine&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;slightly finer than table salt&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;medium&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;most pre-ground coffee&amp;quot; &amp;quot;a consistency similar to sand.&amp;quot; Either is probably good, but go with their &amp;quot;fine&amp;quot; size if you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can get a grinder and whole beans, that ought to improve the taste a lot. Get a burr grinder. Even an inexpensive one should be OK. There are also hand-operated burr grinders, which are inexpensive, quiet, portable, and better exercise :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd really expect pre-ground coffee to have a consistent grinding size. If it looks evenly ground, that's good enough. In contrast, a blade grinder produces widely inconsistent grinds ranging from dust size to whole beans that didn't get cut at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my experience, decaf does not to be brewed any differently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; You can keep beans (esp. ground beans) fresh longer in a vacuum-sealed container such as a Zwilling &amp;quot;Fresh &amp;amp; Save&amp;quot; bag. An AirScape canister also works but it's bulkier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So packing coffee gear for a trip means: AeroPress Go, Zwilling vacuum pump and bag, pre-ground beans (or buy the beans while traveling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: I have no material relationship with these companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Steaming heavy cream?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is there any &lt;em&gt;good way&lt;/em&gt; to steam heavy cream to make a latte? I've occasionally had customers request heavy cream for the milk in their latte, and the result is always a mess. The cream resists the little jets of steam and splatters all over your hands and the countertop and the espresso machine. And it's just so hard to get any air in there that the whole pitcher screams out in pain the whole time, suggesting that it's scalding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only thought is to try to argue with the customer to allow me to put just a little milk in there so I can aerate it properly. Or, maybe dropping the espresso into the cold cream and using &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; water to thin out the cream?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have a magic solution?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What makes people like coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Why are many people so obsessed with coffee? Every time I try it, it's bitter and doesn't taste good. What am I not getting here?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You’re right, most times coffee tastes bitter. But if you’re not against sugar, honey or milk it can improve your cup of coffee. Or you can add cream to make it thicker. I’d say people try different combinations through the years because our taste changes or we just get bored of the same black coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think obsession comes with “culture” and advertisement. And for some people, with addiction. For some reason, coffee became an accessory or an item behind which people can hide by making themselves look busy (if you know what I mean). Coffee also gave people a reason to take breaks between their work or time-consuming hobbies. It’s a good distraction from chaos even tho caffeine should technically make you more energetic contributing to that chaos, but weirdly “coffee breaks” tend to be calm and relaxing. People find some sort of escape in a small cup that smells familiar and warm. It’s a security in a way. For others, it’s a whole ritual of having a coffee break, when they could sneak some time to go into their personal bubble to do stuff like: read a book or an article, listen to music, play some online games, solve online puzzles, complete a trivia or just dream. There are so many things that people usually combine with the act of drinking coffee, thus this beverage associates with lots of good and interesting moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason could be an addition to a familiar routine. You wake up, shower, brush your teeth, make some breakfast.. and a cup of coffee. The funniest part is that breakfast and shower don’t have to be a part of the routine, but coffee often is. Because it’s unchangeable. Even if you’re staying at someone’s place, you’d rather be offered a cup of tea or coffee in the morning, and only then breakfast (which would be unfamiliar, unlike coffee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One plus of coffee being bitter is that it can be drunk with super sweet things smoothing out these extremes. You don’t have to worry about a cake or a chocolate bar being too sweet if you can equalize the taste with the bitterness of coffee. Also, some people like bitter things or quickly get used to it, again, because of the culture around coffee and “if so many people drink it, I should do it too”. Does coffee make people feel included? Maybe. So, it’s not only a physical addiction but also a social one. And I’m not sure, which one is stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Keurig K-Duo Plus brews only half of the brew size selected; k-cup pod holder has a loose object</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently bought a &lt;a href="https://www.keurig.com/Home-Coffee-Makers/K-Duo-Plus%E2%84%A2-Single-Serve-%26-Carafe-Coffee-Maker/p/K-Duo-Plus-Single-Serve-Carafe-Coffee-Maker:Matte%20Black_color" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Keurig K-Duo Plus&lt;/a&gt;. From time to time, when brewing from a k-cup, the brewer only brews half of the brew size selected - e.g., if I choose 8oz/10oz, it only brews like 4oz/5oz. This issue happens quite infrequently so it hasn't bothered me too much - but when I did some googling into why it is caused and what is the solution, I saw some suggestions to see if the k-cup pod holder is clogged. When I opened the pod holder, I saw a loose pin that was lying right under where the k-cup goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know what this pin is, and where it goes / what its purpose is? Is this having been just sitting there loose, in the k-cup holder, something I should worry about? It was not obvious where the pin should have been, and it looks like the pin was coated in black color but lost some of that coating and shows a chrome-colored inside. Please pardon the grainy image, I wanted to add a k-cup for scale so the pin's size is apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FWIW, I took the pin out and brewed a cup without any k-cups, it did brew the full brew size I selected.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Any scientific studies on time versus temperature when brewing coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There are various ways of brewing coffee, ranging from boiling for less than a minute (Turkish) to soaking in the refrigerator for 24 hours (cold brew).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've occasionally tried it at 70°C (160°F) for 2–3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be a simple formula for a continuous mapping of time and temperature for the ideal brew, but I haven't been able to find anything.
Has such a formula been published?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My gut feel is the first initial pass of water will pull more coffee materials from the grounds and making a stronger nicer cup, but I have no clue if that impression is right.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It will be close to four times as strong.  I say &amp;quot;close to&amp;quot; because the amount of coffee can influence some other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long the water is in contact with the grounds affects the strength.  Depending on the brew method, a significantly deeper bed of grounds can slow down how fast water passes through (if water takes longer to get through, it will be stronger).  The finer the grind, the more the effect.  The biggest impact would probably be with a cone-shaped filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're grinding it yourself rather than using coffee pre-ground for a filter brewer (standard grind for store-bought ground coffee), using too fine a grind can slow down the water so much that the filter basket can overflow (and you can get weaker coffee because much of the water bypasses the grounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that if you increase the brew time significantly, the finished coffee can have a different flavor profile (generally not as good).  The coffee can get over-extracted, in which case flavor compounds that tend to be more bitter and sour become more noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grounds retain some of the water, roughly 2 grams of water for every gram of coffee (a paper filter also retains some water).  If you measure using a coffee scoop, coffee makers typically come with a 1 tablespoon size scoop, which will hold somewhere around 5 to 7.5 grams of coffee depending on the coffee, grind size, and whether you level the scoop or use a rounded scoop.  So every 2-3 scoops of coffee with retain about 1 fl oz of water.  If I brew a 12 oz mug of coffee, I need to start with about 14 oz of water to get 12 oz of coffee out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you start with enough grounds for four cups of coffee and brew just one cup, the coffee will retain a significant amount of water relative to your serving.  The relationship between the coffee:water ratio and extraction is based on all the water and all the coffee rather than the water in the brew that ends up in your cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you need to include the retained water when figuring the effect on brew strength.  Enough grounds for four 6 oz cups (the serving size drip coffee makers are based on), at standard strength, will retain roughly 3 oz of water.  So if you don't account for the retained water, you'd end up with a serving of about 3 oz.  You would need to start with water at the 1 1/2 cup level to end up with a one cup serving.  If you were making four cups, the volume loss from retained water wouldn't be that noticeable since cups normally aren't filled to the brim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strength of what is added to the brew does vary from the beginning to the end of the extraction, but that shouldn't be a significant factor in brew strength for the batch in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Manual / inconvenient / minimalist method to make coffee (aim is to reduce consumption)</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a fully automatic machine (bean to cup coffee, around 1600 $) and have problems with excessive coffee consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a solution I have thought, it must be more difficult / less comfortable to make me coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/vvqsn7/what_your_coffee_says_about_you/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a meme I saw different methods to prepare coffee&lt;/a&gt;. I am looking for something similar, something that is more manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rrZeM.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rrZeM.png" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I do not know how to search for these devices in a store, because I do not know the name. Only the &amp;quot;Gentoo&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ubuntu&amp;quot; user I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you help me identify these devices and a very brief description of how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The bottom right &lt;em&gt;Ubuntu user&lt;/em&gt; looks like a coffee pad machine using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Serving_Espresso_Pod" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Easy Server Espresso pods&lt;/a&gt;. I say this because it has the rounded bit above the cup which is where the coffee pad seems to go. Such machines work by inserting a paper pad containing ground coffee. The machine then pushes water through resulting in a cup of coffee. This requires the least effort because the pods can be bought in the store, there's no need to dose yourself and it doesn't need much cleanup after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top left &lt;em&gt;Debian user&lt;/em&gt; is electric filter brewer or drip brewer. In the rounded part above the pot goes a paper or metal filter in which the user adds ground coffee. There's another compartment for water and turning on the machine heats the water brews the coffee into the pot. These kinds of machines often have a heating pad below the pod to keep the coffee hot, though some machines brew into a thermos pot without additional heating instead. This kind of pot is more useful for larger batches; it does require the user to dose the amount of coffee and it's a bit more cleanup (renewing the paper filter or cleaning out the metal filter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom left (&lt;em&gt;Arch&lt;/em&gt;) and bottom middle (&lt;em&gt;Fedora&lt;/em&gt;) look like V60 (&lt;a href="/questions/tagged/v60" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;v60&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;v60&lt;/a&gt;) and Chemex (&lt;a href="/questions/tagged/chemex" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;chemex&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;chemex&lt;/a&gt;) brewers, respectively. They are also filter brewers like Debian one except that they require the user to pour over the water manually. This gives some more control over the brewing process, for example by allowing a longer &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/337"&gt;bloom&lt;/a&gt;. It may take less countertop space because these brewers are small enough to store in most cupboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom middle &lt;em&gt;Fedora user&lt;/em&gt; could also be a cloth filter brewer (they didn't draw the filter). In that case a piece of cloth is used instead of a one-time paper or reusable metal filter. This kind of brewing takes even more time because the cloth filter should be rinsed after each use and stored in a way that no mildew develops in the damp cloth. It's too much to go into here, but James Hoffman has a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr_I3ZVKKb4" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;good video on cloth filter brewing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the top right &lt;em&gt;Gentoo user&lt;/em&gt; shows an espresso machine. This brewing method requires a finer grind of coffee which is tamped into a puck in a portafilter. The machine then pushes high pressure water through the puck to get a concentrated shot of coffee: espresso. Of the methods shown, this gives the user the most customization in terms of brew temperature, brew pressure, grind size, and extraction ratio (how much water to push through before stopping the brew). These aspects may be customized in some of the previous brewing methods too, but they'd have less influence because they use larger grind sizes. Dialing in these parameters can take a few shots (e.g. when changing beans) and each turn tempts one to taste before adjusting the parameters further. As such, I would not really recommend it for one trying to lower their coffee consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the goal of reducing coffee consumption, I'd lean toward the cloth filter brewing method. As it takes some extra time to clean up by rinsing the filter and storing it properly (submerged in clean water in the fridge) in addition to the manually pouring hot water over the grounds, I consider it quite a bit of effort for a simple cup. Before choosing this option though, I'd recommend watching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr_I3ZVKKb4" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;James Hoffman's video on cloth filters&lt;/a&gt; which paints a picture of how involved / rewarding it can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two other brewing methods I feel are worth mentioning: the moka pot and the French press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;moka pot&lt;/a&gt; is a metal stove-top brewer. At the bottom is the water chamber with a funnel to the coffee ground compartment above it. When the water is heated on the stove, the water pushes up through the coffee and into the top chamber where the brewed coffee goes. It's a bit like espresso though the brewing pressure is much lower. These pots come in different sizes. The brewer needs to be taken apart after each use to take out the used coffee, rinse everything off and fill the water and coffee compartments again. I'd say the moka pot is comparable to the cloth filter in terms of effort though it's a bit more forgiving because it doesn't have the mildew issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;French press&lt;/a&gt; is a different brewer to the ones we've seen before. It's an immersion brew in which the ground coffee and the water sit together for about 5 minutes after which a metal filter is used to separate the grounds from the brewed coffee. It's a bit less involved than the moka pot and cloth filter but it still requires cleanup (removing the wet ground from the brew chamber and rinsing everything off) before a new cup can be brewed.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to calculate coffee amount for finished serving size?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When you brew coffee, the grounds retain some of the water (roughly 2g of water for every 1g of coffee).  If you prepare your coffee by weighing everything with a gram scale, the water:coffee ratio is based on all of the coffee and all of the water that goes into the brew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for instance, suppose you want to brew a single serving, and want a specific amount of brewed coffee in your cup when you're done (and don't want to just brew a random larger amount that might be short of the desired serving, or a little more that you will need to drink after it's cold or toss).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to start with the desired serving size of water plus the amount of water that will remain in the grounds.  And the amount of ground coffee required will be based on the amount of water in the finished serving plus the amount of water that will be retained in those grounds, which will be based on the amount of grounds you're trying to determine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you figure out the required weight of coffee to produce the desired finished serving size?  I had to figure this out for some testing, so I'll share it.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The water:coffee ratio can be expressed as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vYL0v.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vYL0v.png" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;br /&gt;
R = water:coffee ratio&lt;br /&gt;
W&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = weight of the water in the serving&lt;br /&gt;
W&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = weight of the water retained in the coffee grounds&lt;br /&gt;
C = weight of the coffee grounds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2g of water are retained for every 1g of grounds, we can substitute 2C for W&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eGXxN.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eGXxN.png" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little algebra rearranging, you get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pve09.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pve09.png" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of how you use the formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose you want a 12 fl oz serving brewed at a 16:1 ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can approximate the water at 30 g/fl oz for easy math, which would give you 360 g of water in the serving.  But if you're weighing grams, you're probably a stickler for precision, so the accurate conversion would be 355 g.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ratio minus 2 would be 14.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The required coffee would be 355 / 14 = 25.4 g.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The required water would use the desired ratio (16) with the calculated coffee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 * 25.4 =  406 g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  <title>Bitter and oxidation?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I used the Bialetti maybe 5x. It’s always bitter. No matter the coffee, temp, tamping etc. always bitter. And never good like my grandparents or mother made it. I noticed black oxidation. I tried to clean it up with BKF and it’s better. But still there. Could this be what is making the coffee bitter? If it is, then I’ll just buy a new pot. But I don’t want to buy a new one if it’s something I’m doing wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If your equipment is clean and your coffee is fresh, bitterness can be caused by two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark roasts. With the Bialetti especially, most people tend to use &amp;quot;italian roast&amp;quot; coffee, which has been roasted into oblivion (i.e. beyond the second crack), making them taste burnt and bitter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overextraction. When brewing with the bialetti, one uses boiling hot water which is in contact with the grounds for much longer than most brewing methods. The general rules for adjusting overextracted coffee apply: grind coarser, lower temperature (impossible with a Bialetti), reduce brewing time. The brewing time can be slightly reduced by preheating the Bialetti and using already boiling water when pouring it inside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be interested in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfDLoIvb0w4" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; by James Hoffmann, explaining what one can do to get a palatable cup of coffee out of the Bialetti moka pot.

  <title>Is there a simple way to see the distribution of particle sizes that my grinder produces?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The holy grail of coffee grinders is uniform particle size.  You can spread some grounds on a piece of paper and eyeball what's there.  There is also special equipment, like sieves, that will separate the particles into size ranges, and visual guides you can compare the grounds against.  But is there a simple way, without fancy equipment, to &amp;quot;sort&amp;quot; the grounds by size so you can see the size range and relative amounts?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coffee-guru-slash-astrophysicist Jonathan Gagné wrote a Python script that analyzes a photograph of ground coffee, and generates histograms by particle size. It has some flaws. It will miss the finest fines completely, for example, but it's interesting enthusiast level stuff, and it's free software.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Which coffee preparation is the most ecological? Low energy / power consumption?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have some years a coffee fully automatic machine from Jura. Now I have tried other ways to prepare coffee, namely &lt;strong&gt;Moka pot&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Chemex&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to keep my electricity consumption as low as possible and wonder which coffee preparation is the most ecological? How do my 3 tried variants compare?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brewing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those three brewing methods, the &lt;strong&gt;Chemex&lt;/strong&gt; should take the least energy when using a microwave oven to heat just the amount of water needed. Microwave ovens are very efficient since nearly all the energy goes into heating the water and (indirectly) the cup holding the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, a &lt;strong&gt;Moka pot&lt;/strong&gt; requires heating the entire pot and its contents over a stove, so a significant fraction of the heat energy goes into the stovetop, pot, and air. Worse, when using a gas stove, it will emit CO?, unhealthy combustion products, and also some methane when starting and stopping the flame. (Use a hood fan to exhaust most of these gasses.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;automatic coffee machine&lt;/strong&gt; has to heat the water and its internal components to the desired temperature, most likely using a resistive electric heater. Even worse if it's in a standby mode that holds the water hot for a long time. I bet energy efficiency is not high on the designers' priority list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better: With an &lt;strong&gt;AeroPress&lt;/strong&gt; you heat just the amount of water needed and heat it to a lower temperature than other brewers. Per the &lt;a href="https://aeropress.com/pages/science" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;manufacturer's recommendation&lt;/a&gt;, 175°F (80°C) or 185°F (85°C). (Or start there and experiment with the brewing temperature to taste.) I set an 1100 watt microwave oven for ?93 seconds, then stir the water (since the heat rises in the cup). (When I'm really picky, I use a thermometer to wait for it to cool to 175°F.) For the best taste, use &amp;quot;bypass brewing,&amp;quot; that is, put 1/4 of the water through the press, stir for 10 seconds, then add rest of the water to the cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best: Use the &lt;strong&gt;AeroPress&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://aeropress.com/pages/cold-brew" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&amp;quot;cold brew&amp;quot; recipe&lt;/a&gt; which skips the heating entirely. (I use an under-sink tap water filter.) The cold brew recipe comes out very tasty, esp. on a hot day. Remember to put only 1/4 of the water into the AeroPress, stir for 1 minute, press, then add the rest of the water to your cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grinding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a hand grinder if you want to save more energy. It provides good exercise and it won't wake the household. It does take more work and time than an electric grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does this dialog from a TV show describe an actual procedure during coffee making?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;This is from one of the episodes of Conan O'Brien's show. In this video he takes one of his staff members to a coffee roasting house. There is a short technobabble at one point in the video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fVDOB9mby_w?t=430" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://youtu.be/fVDOB9mby_w?t=430&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The context starts at 7 min 10 sec (linked above), but the actual statements this question is about, starts at round 7 min 26 sec (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fVDOB9mby_w?t=446" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://youtu.be/fVDOB9mby_w?t=446&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is she describing an actual procedure, or is it just nonsense that sounds real and technical?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The barista was describing the physical action of extraction rather than a specific procedure.  The coffee-making procedures are designed to produce the right amount of extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The living coffee beans contain cells of plant material within a cellulose structure.  When the beans are roasted, the water is driven out and the heat cooks the beans.  You get a &amp;quot;woody&amp;quot; cellulose nugget with all the different organic compounds still integrated and trapped within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 30% of the coffee bean is stuff that is soluable to one degree or another.  Stuff that is highly soluble goes into solution first during the brewing process.  The less soluble the compound is, the longer it takes to go into solution.  The compounds fall into general categories, like acids, sugars, fats, etc.  Compounds in the different categories tend to have similar solubility and generally similar kinds of flavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So early in the extraction, good-flavored acids go into solution (think of the acids in fruit) and predominate the flavors being extracted.  Then sugars predominate the flavors being extracted, etc.  As the extraction progresses, you get more of the flavors that make up the taste profile of coffee, and the flavor becomes fuller and more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you continue to extract beyond the point where good flavors predominate, you start extracting more noticeable amounts of compounds that don't taste good (generally bitter and sour, but not in a good way).  The barista mentions tannins, which are bitter and extracted later in the process because they're less soluble than some of the other compounds.  &lt;a href="https://handground.com/grind/an-intuitive-guide-to-coffee-solubles-extraction-and-tds" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;An Intuitive Guide To Coffee Solubles, Extraction And TDS&lt;/a&gt; has a good description of all this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the idea is not to extract every last bit of soluable material, only the compounds that add pleasant flavors (roughly 20% of what's in the bean).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the compounds into solution is affected by how finely the beans are ground (the finer the grind, the less time it takes the water to soak into the woody material to dissolve the soluble stuff), the water temperature (the hotter the water, the faster compounds go into solution; lower brewing temperature stretches the extraction time to more easily control the stopping point), brewing time, and some other variables, like agitation and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many different methods to brew coffee, from espresso, where the extraction happens in roughly half a minute, to cold brew, where extraction takes a major fraction of a day.  But within any method, the flavor profile builds in the same sequence.  The art and science of coffee making focuses on controlling the variables to get the good flavors extracted, and then to stop the extraction before the flavor is overwhelmed by bad flavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what the barista was describing.&lt;/p&gt;

We buy pre ground coffee (I know, sacrilege). Even thought I strip and clean the coffee basket every time about one in five will have no coffee coming through, or a very slow drip, due to a grain getting through the first filter and becoming stuck in the tiny output hole.

  <title>Is my 51mm tamper slightly too small?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've had a &lt;a href="https://www.lapavoni.com/en/product/professional-lusso-wooden-handles/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lapavoni coffee machine&lt;/a&gt; for 2 years, but I can't get my espresso right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem I have is quite simple: when I lift the handle to make the water flow, the water flows straight out. I think the problem is the size of my tamper which is 51mm whereas the portafilter is 51.5mm or maybe 51.6mm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I buy a tamper like &lt;a href="https://www.bplus.biz/products/516mm-tamper" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; for example, will my problem be solved?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>

&lt;p&gt;The time it takes for water to percolate through the portafilter on tank pressure alone is the best measure of your grind/tamp combination. I shoot for 4 to 6 seconds. Then I let it drip (?pre-infuse?) for 10 seconds before pulling down the lever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If water goes through too fast, make the grind finer or tamp harder. If water takes too long, make the grind courser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a continuum of grind/tamp combinations that can give the 4-6 second effect. But too of a course grind with really hard tamp gives weak extraction. Also, you get very little crema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with your 51mm diameter tamper. My tamper is 51.7mm, with only a few ‘thou clearance. I made it on a metal lathe for a custom fit. But even a small bit of grounds on the edge and it jams. I need to wipe the edge every time I use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know many caffeine-heads poo-poo tamping scales. But you cannot get consistent performance without it. It doesn’t matter how hard you tamp, but it must be consistent. You can jerry-rig a scale. Get a wooden ruler and put a pink pencil eraser under each end. Put your portafilter half way and tamp until the ruler bends enough to touch the counter. If you want a harder tamp, move the erasers a bit closer together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hint: The brew head is a big chunk of metal which will cool the water and under-extract if the head is not pre-heated. Run a full shot of water through the head to pre-heat before pulling the first shot.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to assemble needles in Sworksdesign's Espresso WDT tool?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just received the &lt;a href="https://sworksdesign.com/Aluminum-WDT-Tool-p387817741" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;WDT tool from Sworksdesign&lt;/a&gt;, which is a tool to fluff up and even out the espresso in the basket before compressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the tool came with next to no assembly instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body and the needles came separate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ckGuD.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eY86l.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HJCnr.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the following cryptic words were on a leaflet (attached to the needle bag):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The middle position will require a kink at the end of the needle handle to stay firmly in place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bPijg.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I install the needles?&lt;/strong&gt; Do I have to disassemble the body somehow or do I just push the needles in? Which way? I assume the thicker &amp;quot;wire-wrapped&amp;quot; end goes &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anybody have experience with this? Thanks heaps for any pointers!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/xqcwal/comment/iq8xnsl/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the advice from redditer bigalbundy1827&lt;/a&gt; I did the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just push needles in every &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; hole plus one needle with the advise bent in the middle channel. Make sure  to put the &lt;em&gt;wired side&lt;/em&gt; of the needle down in the hole until it reaches the bottom of the channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it seems to work fine for me: breaking the grind with the WDT tool seems to make the coffee a bit tastier and stronger. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it safe to use a glass bodum coffee maker on a heating pad?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Bonavita drip coffee maker, very similar to &lt;a href="https://bonavita.life/products/metropolitan-8-cup-one-touch-coffee-brewer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; with a glass carafe. I've broken the carafe and for reasons, am having problems getting a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I'm using a Chemex 8 cup, glass, pour over maker/carafe with the unit and it works just ok. The base is too large, so it doesn't actually sit on the heating pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found a Bodum, &lt;a href="https://www.bodum.com/us/en/11571-109-pour-over" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;8 cup glass coffee maker&lt;/a&gt; which fits the unit perfectly. However, the literature says &amp;quot;Not for stove top use&amp;quot;. I'm trying to figure out if it's safe to use this maker, as the carafe in my unit as it'll fit and sit directly on the unit's heating pad. The Bodum says it is &amp;quot;borosilicate glass&amp;quot;, and Bodum customer service only tells me &amp;quot;this configuration has not been tested&amp;quot;. So before I commit to the Bodum, does anyone have practical experience with using this on top of a heating pad?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's probably safe.  I can give you a theoretical answer.  Someone who has repeatedly done it could add anecdotal evidence that theirs hasn't broken yet (or refute the idea if they tried it and it broke).  Explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question focuses on the glass, so I'll start with that.  Borosilicate glass has a very low coeficient of thermal expansion, making it very tolerant of high temperatures, rapid changes in temperature, and temperature differences within an item.  All borosilicate glass generally has that characteristic, but the exact composition and manufacturing process varies, and not all borosilicate glass is the same.  Some products could handle more extreme situations than others.  But it's likely that any borosilicate glass from a reputable manufacturer could handle the temperatures and conditions encountered in food and beverage preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some context, the original Pyrex formulation was a type of borosilicate glass patented by Corning.  It could be heated on the stove top or a hot plate, or go from refrigerator to oven without breaking.  Some Pyrex products are still made with borosilicate glass, but the kitchenware now generally is not.  It was changed to tempered soda-lime glass because that's much cheaper to make, and that is usually adequate for most household food and beverage preparation requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tempered soda-lime glass will handle oven temperatures, but not large, rapid temperature changes or differences within an item.  For example, it can't be used on a stove top or have direct contact with the heating element.  Laboratories that use glassware that will be heated generally stick with borosilicate glass because it is more tolerant of temperature-related issues than tempered soda-lime glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disreputable manufacturer could make crappy borosilicate glass, which didn't have the thermal stability you would expect.  Bodum is a reputable brand, and likely would not use substandard glass.  This item was designed for a different usage.  It sounds like the company has not specifically tested it on a hot plate, so they don't want to speculate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all that said, I suspect the issue with the stove-top use warning is not the glass, but the collar, which looks like it's made of cork and leather (and the plastic filter above that).  Those could be susceptible to damage from an open flame on a gas stove, or intense heat from an over-sized electric burner.  But if the bottom of the carafe is properly sized and on a drip coffee maker heating pad, that issue wouldn't be relevant.  It ought to be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to get rid of the moisture in coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;As pointed out &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/5980"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, my coffee powder seems to have caught moist. Since it is in a significant quantity and a very nice powder, I don't want to waste it. Is there any solution to this problem? The obvious one that came to my mind was heating it up on a low flame, but I don't know the pros and cons of it. Can someone help me with this?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'll take it as given that the problem you have comes from moisture in your finely ground coffee.  Indeed &lt;a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/rbeaa/a/5Mq6qBqfDBZ5DqYBx3nkXTb/?lang=en" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show finely ground coffee, other variables being held constant, has a greater hygroscopic tendancy (absorbing moisture from the surroundings during storage) and a higher angle of repose ?:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angle of repose is useful in order to acquire information regarding solid flowability. According to Shittu &amp;amp; Lawal (2007), during powder reconstitution, water molecules that hydrate the product's surface tend to reduce cohesivity between particles, allowing a rapid water penetration; thus, powders that possess high angles of repose, have higher difficulty to incorporate water. All factors tested (roast level, grind size and storage time), and the interactions between them, significantly influenced the angle of repose (?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll report the experiment that I did with removing moisture from used espresso coffee grounds by repeated microwaving.  This is no guarantee that it will resolve the problem reported by the OP, where in an earlier Question &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/5979/south-indian-filter-not-brewing-properly"&gt;South Indian filter not brewing properly&lt;/a&gt; it was said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know why, but suddenly it is taking longer to finish the brew and sometimes (mostly from the second time) the water doesn't even go down. It just stays in the upper part of the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method of brewing is unfamiliar to me, and the description &amp;quot;to brew without using the middle small instrument which looks like the one used in a french press&amp;quot; sounds like it is akin to a pour over (the tag &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/drip-brew" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;drip-brew&amp;#39;" aria-label="show questions tagged &amp;#39;drip-brew&amp;#39;" rel="tag" aria-labelledby="drip-brew-container"&gt;drip-brew&lt;/a&gt; was used there and here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility of drying coffee grounds was dismissed in &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/4744/34"&gt;this previous Answer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t attempt to dry wet grounds - the quality would likely suffer and for brewing they will be made wet again, which would make the drying step moot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However there is perhaps something about the method of brewing at issue here that avoids these objections.  So to proceed with the experiment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hkoqG.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hkoqG.jpg" alt="experiment drying" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the left is a frozen portafilter basket with used espresso grounds, which presents something of a maximally moist batch of coffee grounds.  I emptied the basket into a spare microwaveable dish (a creme brulee crock).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting my 1200W microwave to 30 seconds, I ran it and checked to see how hot or warm the dish and its contents became.  In the first run the contents became noticeably steamy, but then heating declined (water is specifically absorbing of the microwave radiation).  After a dozen runs the used grounds seemed to be contributing nothing to the warming of the dish (an empty crock by itself gets warmed but not hot in 30 seconds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the touch the grounds now feel dry, and as a test I put the dish in the freezer for 30 minutes.  This produced no clumping or grounds sticking to the dish.  So I'm going to say this was a quick and effective technique to dry the grounds per se, without resort to expensive &lt;a href="https://www.uline.com/BL_1004/Silica-Gel-Desiccants?pricode=WB5888&amp;amp;Sitelink=silica_gel" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;desiccant supplies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obhYSf1ogoo" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;DIY vaccum freeze drying&lt;/a&gt; equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we invoke the platitude that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure:  storing the fresh coffee ground in packaging that prevents moisture absorbtion is easier than trying to fix a problem later on.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the best way to remove the sieve/filter from the funnel of a moka pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I often buy used pots for my little collection and want to give them a thorough cleaning. However, removing the sieve is a PITA with the crimp that is there holding it in. Note that I am not talking about the sieve that is held in place by the gasket. That is simple enough to remove. However, the funnel sieve is more difficult to remove without bending it badly. I've been turning the funnel upside down and pushing the end of a beater (from and electric beater) into it and pushing it out. However, that takes some force, resulting in a bent sieve. There has to be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much "more" flavor to expect from pour over vs drip coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently switched over to pour over coffee from my previous drip machine setup as I heard that I would get &amp;quot;more flavor&amp;quot; that way. I'm using a gooseneck kettle, v60 and scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Overall, I think the coffee is pretty similar, maybe 5-10% more flavorful w pour-over vs drip. I wonder if some of the perceived improvement is a placebo effect (extra effort = &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; coffee).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What do you think? Is pour-over supposed to be significantly more flavorful than drip or just a bit more? (I'm using fresh ground beans in both cases; I prefer dark roast coffee).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Appreciate the input!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's not very useful to talk about flavor with coffee because different people will perceive the very same drink as having different flavors and amounts of flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, one way to measure extraction is to measure total dissolved solids (TDS) dissolved in the water both before and after brewing. While total dissolved solids isn't a measure of flavor, it should give a general sense of amount of potentially perceptible compounds in the drink, though of course a given individual may or may not be able to taste some of those solids since, you know, everyone's different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do people say pour-over tastes better than drop? Two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason #1: Drop coffee makers are the easiest to use. Programmable models can be set up with coffee and water in the evening, then brew for you while you sleep and have your coffee ready for you in the morning. Fabulous. Except ease of use doesn't translate to ease of care. Drip machines are often poorly maintained because of the expectation of convenience, and poorly maintained coffee machines make bad coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason #2: Again with the convenience of drip coffee makers, two core design philosophies compromise on drink quality: drip coffee makers often encourage preloading coffee well in advance of brewing, which leads to stale coffee, and heated carafes to keep coffee hot degrade flavor the longer the brew sits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the differences between pour-over and drip depend mostly on how you use each. If you leverage the conveniences of the drip maker, you'll get a drink most people would call lower quality. But if you always brew freshly ground coffee in your drip brewer and consistently clean and descale your drip brewer, you may find that the performance of the drip machine is similar to the performance of a pour-over method. That's because the two methods actually are very similar in function: hot water is poured (dropped) slowly over a bed of coffee grounds and allowed to drip through, pulled by gravity. In fact, the automatic drip machine was invented in the first place to serve as an automatic pour-over solution. (Yes, pour-over existed long before drip, with the first commercial form being the Mr. Biggin coffee pot of the 1780s, featuring a top chamber designed to fit a sock which would act as a filter for coffee to be piled on top and hot water poured over all and allowed to drip through--the first commercial pour-over solution.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLDR: People are lazy and often end up making &amp;quot;lazy coffee&amp;quot; with drip machines. YMMV and results may vary depending on your own personal level of laziness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately put it on the stove. I put it on high for 50 seconds then turn the stove off to let it coast until there's a shot or two of coffee in the pitcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the coffee hasn't started to run by the time you turn the stove off, just wait. If it still hasn't started to run, adjust the time you leave it on high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put it back on the stove, on high. When the boiler is up to pressure (the bottom of mine starts to get just round enough that you can rock it back and forth) submerge the nozzle in a pitcher of milk and open the valve. Milk steaming technique is outside of the scope of this tour.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does tamping well compensate for too high pressure?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm new to making espresso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a &lt;em&gt;Gaggia Classic&lt;/em&gt; machine for home use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sometimes pours slowly, sometimes more quickly -- slower if I tamp the coffee well i.e. press hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My theory is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaggia Classic machines are factory-shipped with too much pressure, i.e. 14 bar, so they can also handle coffee pods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The recommended pressure for espresso machines is more like 9 to 12 bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the pressure too high, the water might force a channel through the coffee, instead of seeping evenly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By tamping the coffee hard and thoroughly, I avoid that so it does seep slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is -- is this &amp;quot;hack&amp;quot;, i.e. tamping the coffee hard, good enough? Or should I for some reason make the effort to lower the machine's pressure?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's not directly the pump that is the problem, but the OPV, the over pressure valve, which diverts the water back to the tank when a certain pressure is exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, if you want to change your machine to 9 bar, look for OPV mod instructions online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as r mac noted, the pressure is actually controlled by the coffee puck, the problem with a machine which produces up to 14 bar is that you cannot visually determine when you have adjusted grind, dose, and tamp to the recommended 9 bar. Even if the puck is too dense, the water will be pushed through just fine; but the resulting coffee will be sub-optimal. After adjusting the OPV, you can see when you reach the point where the flow will be just right, and anything denser will choke.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;For decaffeination, is &amp;quot;Mountain Water Process&amp;quot; the same as &amp;quot;Swiss Water Process&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sales person said the &amp;quot;Mountain&amp;quot; process is better, because it uses mountain water. (I wonder where they think Switzerland is.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two like the same thing to me.
(If so, is there a generic term for the process?)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Sales people will do what sales people do - try to sell you stuff. Both processes are identical, using caffeine depleted green coffee extract (GCE) as a base for their extraction, trying to match the concentration of soluble material inside the coffee beans in the GCE. As you correctly stated the mountain process uses mountain water and that's about where the differences stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difference between mountain water and tap water is the concentration of minerals. Perhaps less minerals are beneficial for a better extraction (in which case, why not use demineralised water instead of mountain water?) but in essence the processes are the same and I have yet to find a reputable Q-Grader that claims mountain water makes the coffee better in any way which can not be achieved with the regular water process.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Gaggia Classic crema is a bit "bubbly"</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've got a &lt;a href="https://www.segafredo.com.au/product/new-gaggia-classic-pro-colour-vibes/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gaggia Classic (this particular model)&lt;/a&gt; that I've been doing some light mods to (changed 12 bar spring for a 9 bar, lower drip tray and so on). Anyway, lately I've noticed that the crema when I pull a shot ends up getting a bit &amp;quot;bubbly&amp;quot; at the edge rather than creamy/silky. It starts off okay and then when it's finished, the crema has a ring around the edge with lots of bubbles (say the size of a small ball bearing, larger than peppercorns let's say). I haven't changed my method of grinding, tamping, etc. I've only had it 6 months, do I need to descale it, or ...? (please pardon me, I'm really new to all of this and have been watching plenty YouTube videos just to learn how to use it, and think I've nearly got the hang of it). To be honest, it was doing this bubbly crema thing even before I changed the spring for 9 bar (based on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR1_cgUR9ks" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;, I'm sure I did it correctly, even though he went through the specific process way too quickly in my opinion). Any help is greatly appreciated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts off okay and then when it's finished, the crema has a ring around the edge with lots of bubbles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds very much like you're pulling a nice shot of espresso but then letting it run way too long. Does the color of the liquid also change and become a lot lighter? If so, you are definitely pulling to much water through your puck. The liquid in your last picture looks quite light and translucent so that really might be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your comments you say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ground 12 grams of coffee beans, and the weight of just the extracted coffee liquid in the mug seems to be 150 grams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really is too much for 12 grams of coffee. The ideal ratio is somewhere between 1:2 and 1:3 depending on your preference. So with 12g of ground coffee, I wouldn't go for more than 36g of liquid in your cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might say that you like the less intense taste and less thick consistency if the ratio is higher but you'll have to do this at the expense of the crema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note, that crema doesn't say anything about the quality of the coffee. Crema &amp;quot;happens&amp;quot; because the water is under such a high pressure, that the  CO2 from the coffee is forced into the liquid, resulting in that foam we call crema. You can have excellent coffee with no crema and you can also have absolutely rancid coffee with crema, don't get too hung up on that if you prefer your espresso (or with your amount of water it would, ironically, be more of a [Swiss] Caffè crema) with more water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also try to brew an Americano: brew a regular espresso with a ratio of 1:2 to 1:3 and then add hot water. This has one major benefit: You can use the same grind setting for all of your espresso based drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want higher consistency shot to shot (at the expense of a little bit more work) you can buy a &lt;a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B08LF1YQ8T" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;scale specifically designed for espresso&lt;/a&gt;. That way you can weigh and time your espresso shots and then adjust your grind size accordingly. As a general starting point for your setup, I would recommend a total brew time of 30s with 12g in and 30g out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really wanna get deep into espresso and hear from an industry expert, I can definitely recommend &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTFsBqhpLes&amp;amp;list=PLxz0FjZMVOl3MuAzK5l3gjakoOGrmK8fP" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Understanding Espresso&lt;/a&gt;, a youtube video series by James Hoffmann, where he goes through all the variables involved when brewing espresso in a slow and understandable manner.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Controlling Acidity - Comandante C40 MK3 RedClix &amp; Bodum Chambord French Press 3 Cup - 12 floz</title>
  <body>&lt;h2&gt;Did I not brew long enough? Should I go finer &amp;amp; less time? Or coarser &amp;amp; longer brew?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been getting acidic brews using french press method.  Between sips I have a tart after taste in my mouth.  Really triggers my acid reflux. Just a minute after sipping my throat starts getting irritated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Merit Coffee - Strawberry Field. It's a rotating natural they provide seasonally. Guatemalan, Anaerobic Natural, and [Strawberry, White Chocolate, Pear] notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it's expected with a natural coffee especially anaerobic, but I like berry &amp;amp; chocolate notes and this coffee is perfect when I use my Moccamaster or V60. I thought the pear description instead of citrus description implied it was not as acidic, but this one is kicking my butt using a french press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been brewing @ 60g/1L ratio with 22g ground at 70 RedClix (35 clicks) I brew with 266.66g of water and add 100g of milk afterward and add additional water to adjust taste. I use the Bodum Chamford 3 cup french press. I brew using this &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/st571DYYTR8" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://youtu.be/st571DYYTR8&lt;/a&gt; recipe modified to {3:30 + (break crust again) + 3:30}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22g x (266g+100g) @ 70 RedClix (35 Clicks) Comandante for 7 min.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the most forgiving way to brew hot coffee with an Aeropress when equipped with a low-end grinder?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm using a standard Aeropress and a Hario slim grinder. With the cold brew method (where you stir the ground coffee in cold water for a minute) I can get something very refreshing and tea-like, but with hot brew methods I've had very inconsistent results with the James Hoffmann method, the bypass method, and the pourover method, using supermarket medium roast decaf beans, as well as supermarket light roast beans. Sometimes I get coffee that borders on delicious, and sometimes it's worse than the coffee I can buy at Sonic. I'm using filtered water and I'm grinding my coffee twice, once at double the number of clicks and then again at the actual intended number, as I've heard that makes for a more consistent grind with the Hario slim. Still, I look at my ground coffee and see a wide range of particle size, so I figure the inconsistency of brew has to do with my grinder. I currently cannot afford a nicer grinder, so I'm looking to see if there are any other tricks I can do to get more consistent coffee. I know with cheap beans and a cheap grinder that there's an upper limit on how nice it can be, but it would still be nice to have a consistent 5-6/10 cup instead of the 2-7/10 range I've been getting. I do also worry that maybe I'm being put off by otherwise good brew methods by having unlucky grinds on days where I try them.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Try this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare the cap by applying a filter. If using a paper filter, sprinkle a little bit of cold water on it after putting it in the cap to prep it for the press. This will be a high pressure press by the end of it, and pre-wetting reduces the chances of the filter ripping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare 18g coffee ground medium-fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invert the Aeropress and pull the plunger to the bottom of the 4 marker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloom with near-boiling water just to the top of the grounds and gently stir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait 30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill to the top with near-boiling water. Screw on the cap and flip onto a mug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press slowly. The full press should take about 45s-1min. The medium-fine grind will create pressure that makes it easy to go slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop when the plunger touches the coffee grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should give you a solid concentrate to which you can then add water, milk, or flavorings if that's your jam.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Looking for proportions on bulk cold brew preparation (2.5 or 5 gal batches)</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm preparing to serve Cold Brew coffee at a local renaissance festival (billed as &amp;quot;alchemy &amp;amp; potions&amp;quot;).  I've looked into various bulk / semi-commercial systems, most of which are in the 5 gallon container range.  I'll have access to a large industrial sink, large refrigerators, etc. So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I cannot find is a reliable ratio of coffee grounds to water, that also specifies if the result will be able to be served straight, or it will be a concentrate that will need to be diluted.  I've seen ratios by volume of 1 cup Grounds to 4 cups water, 1 to 8, and also 1 pound per Gallon.  (I did the 1:4 at home in a 1-gallon jar and it was VERY strong - I'm guessing that was the Concentrate ratio...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general plan is to set up the container in the evening (around 8 or 9 PM), set it in the refrigerator overnight, and around 9:00 AM drain it into serving containers, so it has 12 hours to steep.  I can do longer if that works better, but I imagine that will be impacted by the amount of coffee grounds I am using as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can anyone offer guidance on the best volume / weight of grounds to use for a 5 gallon container (using a coffee sock or other filter), how long to let that volume brew, and if the result will be drinkable or needs to be diluted?  I can't get a clear answer that covers all three variables at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can you microwave a Chemex to reheat the coffee in it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Are Chemex carafes microwave-safe, or will it explode (or otherwise get damaged)?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h4&gt;Short Answer: Yes.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Longer Answer:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemex (company) does not officially market their carafes as microwave-safe, nor do they officially endorse microwaving them. In addition, microwaving wood can cause it to desiccate, warp, or crack, so the most cautious approach would certainly not be to microwave the carafe with the wooden collar attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That being said,&lt;/em&gt; there has never been a report of a Chemex carafe exploding after being microwaved under normal conditions, and in general wooden dishware is commonly microwaved without noticeable damage. And personally, I heat my Chemex carafe (with wood collar still attached) in the microwave all the time, with no damage ever observed. (This presupposes reasonable microwaving conditions; i.e. no longer than 60 seconds at a time, and never making the wood collar painfully/dangerously hot to the touch. These limits should be sufficient to heat a typical Chemex carafe's worth of coffee from room-temperature to drinking-temperature.)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Delonghi ecp3420 spraying water when pulling shots</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a delonghi ecp3420 that sprays water when pulling shots, usually when I grind fine, not always, I use IMS Precision 16-18g FilterBasket with a 51mm bottomless portafilter and a
MIGOOZI
Espresso Puck Screen 51mm, Reusable 1.7mm Thickness 100?m Stainless Steel Professional Barista Coffee Filter Mesh Plate for Espresso Portafilter Filter Basket (51mm)      what can it be?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;What you're describing sounds like &lt;em&gt;channeling&lt;/em&gt;. Channeling is caused by a less than ideal combination of grind size, tamp pressure, and tamp evenness (grind distribution). It can also be caused in part by roast level of the beans, with very dark, brittle beans more likely to cause channeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channeling is when the water, under pressure from the pump, finds a fast route through the puck by creating or finding a channel. It sprays because the water is under pressure and because there is a larger volume of water being pushed by the pump than what fits through the channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part of the espresso experience and takes practice to perfect. Try different grind settings first, and make sure you're tamping. Even bad tamping is better than no tamping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamping should be level with the rim of the portafilter, but the level of grounds in the portafilter doesn't have to rise to the rim (and in fact shouldn't). Before tamping, tap the portafilter basket lightly while holding the portafilter to shake the grounds into a somewhat even distribution. Then, using your tamper, press hard but not super hard--thirty pounds is the recommended pressure for tamping. Place your portafilter on a scale and practice of you're not good at estimating your strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't find a grind setting that works after working out a good tamping routine, the next most likely culprit is your coffee. If you live in a place where you can buy freshly roasted coffee (roasted within the past week), I highly recommend that. Otherwise look for a small coffee shop--not a chain--that sells beans sourced from their own supply--not prepackaged--and buy those. Finally if none of these options are available where you live, look online. There are a number of coffee roasters that ship freshly roasted coffee, though this method is often more expensive due to shipping costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your bottomless portafilter should be helping you visualize channeling to help you better recognize problems with your tamping routine. It's also a beautiful way to make espresso when the water is correctly pushed through the whole puck, coming together in a tiger's eye striped column of absolute beauty on its way down to the shot glass. When you see that single column down the middle, you'll know you got it right.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How much caffeine is extracted from roasted ground coffee beans?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What is the percentage of caffeine extraction when brewing coffee? In other words, how much of the caffeine in ground coffee dissolves in hot water? Is it correct that the degree of extraction is between 90% and almost 100% with whatever brewing method?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different brewing methods were unequally efficient at releasing the caffeine from the coffee beans.
Even our champion, the ristretto, only managed to release about 31 percent of the original caffeine.
On average, all the techniques only release &lt;strong&gt;about 10 percent&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
— &lt;a href="https://www.coffeeness.de/en/how-much-caffeine-in-coffee/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;How Much Caffeine Is Really in Your Coffee?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… caffeine levels can vary significantly but its been estimated that &lt;strong&gt;90% of the caffeine is extracted within the first minute of brewing&lt;/strong&gt;.
The variance in caffeine levels is attributed to several factors including extraction time, temperature, grind level and type of coffee used - making true calculations difficult to publish.&lt;br /&gt;
— &lt;a href="https://www.coffeechemistry.com/caffeine-in-coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Caffeine in Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I believe the confusion arises from what is extracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, a sane person would like to extract the tasty aromatic oils out of the bean and dissolve them in the water to be able to enjoy it. Apparently, the effect of dissolved caffeine to the taste of the coffee is practically non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is difficult to extract all of the oils. Moreover, you probably do not want them all. You just want to extract the most delicious part&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is quite easy to extract caffeine just by leaving the beans in water even in a very short amount of time&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, most of the caffeine dissolves in the water way early before any of the delicious oils dissolve. I have never had any measurement by myself but it is said that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;around 90% of caffeine is extracted even in a few seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;around 15% of oils are extracted in a typical cup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; For example, over-brewed coffee tasted bitter. Most granule coffees are bitter, too. As they are prepared by extracting nearly everything out of the beans with huge percolators, then drying the extracted syrup out.&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; This is actually how Swiss de-caffeination method works. You just leave the green beans in water for some time. Caffeine dissolves in water. You take the beans out of water and dry them.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How Long to Steep French Press Coffee for the Perfect Brew?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Steeping time is the period during which your coffee grounds and water mingle in your French press, creating a brew that’s bursting with flavor and aroma. It’s crucial because it directly affects two fundamental aspects of coffee: flavor and strength.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to steeping time in a French press, there’s a sweet spot you want to hit for that perfect cup of coffee. While there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, there are some general guidelines that can steer you in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most coffee enthusiasts, a steeping time of about &lt;strong&gt;4 to 5 minutes is considered the gold standard&lt;/strong&gt;. This duration allows the coffee grounds to fully infuse the water, extracting the flavors without overdoing it. However, this can vary depending on factors like grind size, water temperature, and personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy a milder cup, you might opt for &lt;strong&gt;a shorter steeping time of around 3 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;. On the other hand, if you like your coffee &lt;strong&gt;strong and robust&lt;/strong&gt;, extending the steeping time to &lt;strong&gt;6 minutes&lt;/strong&gt; or slightly longer could be your go-to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But remember, these are just starting points. The best way to determine your ideal steeping time is through a bit of trial and error. Start with the 4 to 5-minute range and then adjust based on your taste preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's best median between grinding coffee beans every day or the whole bag at once so that it stays relatively fresh?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I recently switched from buying pre-ground coffee to whole beans and I am grinding it myself at home for a French Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that grinding coffee every time I want to make it would be the freshest way to enjoy it. However, this is time-consuming to do every morning. I typically only drink one cup per day so if I grind the whole bag at once I am afraid it would get stale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would be the best median between grinding it every day or the whole bag at once so that the ground coffee still remains relatively fresh?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off/166#166"&gt;previous question/answer here&lt;/a&gt;, even whole bean coffee may be appreciably stale after 14 days, and ground coffee within minutes.  If you are considering pre-grinding, any number of days is probably going to affect flavor.  Why not experiment?  I don't think you will want to wait 14 days with ground, but you could experiment and see if you can taste a difference after 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You mention using a Black and Decker grinder.  If that's a typical blade grinder and not one of their burr grinders, you might find that having your beans ground with a coarse setting at the coffee shop tastes better even at 14 days with a French Press.  Blade grinders don't grind as evenly and can result in some pretty fine coffee grounds that negatively affect French Press.  Grind consistency is important.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there any possibility to get a cup of Single Origin coffee when you grind Blended coffee beans?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blended&lt;/em&gt; coffee is mixed by several different kinds of coffee beans while &lt;em&gt;Single Origin&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;SOE&lt;/em&gt; coffee uses only one type. Given a background where you bought a bag of &lt;em&gt;blended&lt;/em&gt; coffee beans and now trying to grind it by yourself for a cup of morning coffee. As the bean bag was not packaged/mixed evenly, the beans you put inside the grinder are therefore not according to their &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;blended&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; percentage as expected. As a result, can I say every cup of &lt;em&gt;blended&lt;/em&gt; is unique due to the random bean ratio, and it may have an extreme case where the &lt;em&gt;blended&lt;/em&gt; coffee you drink is actually a &lt;em&gt;Single Origin&lt;/em&gt; one?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Damaging effects from water in pre-ground coffee container/funnel DeLonghi ecam550.65sb?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;A relative of mine accidentally poured water into the pre-ground coffee hole/funnel. Is there a risk of things getting damaged? I know someone has asked this question for a Magnifica S, but I have a ecam550.65sb which might have different effects. It took a few days to notice this as the relative did not mention anything and when I was about to empty the container for the coffee grounds it was filled with water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I have not got any experience on this machine, but very probably no harm occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most automatic machines pre-ground funnel is a shortcut to the tamping mechanism. So, the coffee put in the funnel directly goes on top of the mechanism, tamped, then boiling water is directed onto it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, all of the water just passes through the heat-resistant mechanism and fills in the reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What temperature should brewing coffee from ground beans be reheated to?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have not been able to find any answers to this. Does anybody know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I originally heat the brewing coffee from ground beans, the temperature is the boiling point of water as recommended but if I reheat to the boiling point of water again I have a feeling, the coffee will become dry and gray, but I have not tried it as of yet.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The brewing temperature should be between 90 °C and 95 °C. If the temperature is too low, the aroma will be constrained, and if it is too high, the coffee will have a bitter and burnt flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffe for cocktails?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;What coffe is suitable for cocktail use? How strong should I make it? I only have an &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; coffe machine (I don't know the english name), but its similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WacVI.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WacVI.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this set-up you buy already grinded powder from the store, and fill it up with water. So my question is given this set-up: how strong coffe should I make for drinks like Irish Coffe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: Should I switch set-up to something else?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I may hesitate to call an Irish Coffee a cocktail (it’s typically listed under hot drinks in a menu), but in any case, the coffee from your setup is pretty much exactly what reflects the preparation method that would have been prevalent in Ireland back in the 1940s. Another option that would also fit the time window would be a percolator, or a vacuum coffee maker (siphon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength is up to you, usually people would aim for a slightly stronger brew as sugar, whisky and cream will be a strong counter-part, in a gustatory sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern preparations may use an espresso machine and draw a lungo, simply because it may be the setup available in many bar or restaurant settings. There is no reason though to invest in one just to make an authentic Irish Coffee (you wouldn’t).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a more general sense, there is no one-fits-all coffee preparation for cocktails. An espresso martini would obviously call for an espresso, but there are countless recipes out there that use pretty much any kind of coffee. Usually the recipe should specify which kind.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can a stainless steel moka rust?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been using a stainless steel moka for the last couple months. A fee days ago some spots started to appear (I believe after putting it on the stove without water by mistake). Is the pot rusting? &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zWCgC.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zWCgC.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Stainless steel is not immune from corrosion (&amp;quot;rusting&amp;quot;), only has it a highest resistance. What you see is likely &lt;a href="https://www.ddcoatings.co.uk/2276/what-is-pitting-corrosion" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;pitting corrosion&lt;/a&gt;, and it does occur especially in stainless steels. I can only guess what happened, but in my opinion some salts remained on the surface after water evaporated and that caused the corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is espresso supposed to be bitter and drank on its own or am I supposed to add something to it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;first time posting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was eating at a bistro the other day and noticed that they had &amp;quot;Espresso Shot&amp;quot; on the menu. Now I'm not really a coffee connoisseur and I might be burned at the stake by the people here but I've only ever drank instant coffee, the powdered ones you mix with a cup of hot water and stir. These kinds of coffee are often sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard of espresso before as something that gives you a kick and since I've never had one before, I ordered it. The dude serving asked me if I was sure since I ordered just the espresso shot and I said yes. Then he asked me again just to verify and I said yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was served it, it was pretty dang bitter but not so bad that I couldn't tolerate it. I drank it all after finishing my meal and went on my way but thinking back to the guy asking me twice, I couldn't help but wonder, was I supposed to add anything to it in the first place? Or was it supposed to be that bitter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to note that I don't know what kind of espresso it was nor did I even knew there were different kinds of espresso until I looked it up. The menu just literally said &amp;quot;Espresso Shot.........PRICE&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;No, you didn’t do anything wrong. There are lots of people that enjoy their espresso “pure” and most would argue that you can enjoy the unadulterated flavor best that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there’s also no harm in adding some sugar to your coffee or even a bit of milk. And of course the espresso is a key component in various “espresso-and-milk” combinations. Depending on where you live, espresso  and the coffee culture based on espresso may be uncommon - your question implies that this may be the case here - and servers learned the hard way that not all customers will deal with the relatively bitter unsweetened drink without complaints. The espresso per se will be bitter, especially if you are used to sweet instant coffee drinks, in that case a spoonful of sugar can be a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that a good quality espresso should not be excessively bitter, but of course we cannot judge what you got.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How suitable is a glass pot for making Turkish Coffee with milk?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm looking into Turkish Coffee and it looks very appealing from a flavor, caffeine strength. and cleanup perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was considering one of the electric machines to boil, but it kinda seems like they have a very short and harsh boil.  So now I'm more leaning towards just a little pot.  Now, the shape of the pot seems to matter.  From what I can tell a small diameter will help to keep the sediment at the bottom.  But what is the purpose of the neck?  To control the boiling and prevent spills?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For material, I like the copper but am now leaning towards just a little glass pot shaped as the traditional Turkish Coffee pots are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd be interested to hear how glass works in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly as I intend to make my coffee with milk rather than water.  My concern being that cleaning a delicate glass container of milk products sounds unfeasible.  So it would have to be metal for milk?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Disadvantages of coffee?</title>

My current job,  I got bored  with retirement,  now averages 35 - 40 hours per week involving continuously standing,  bending,  stretching,  and walking an average of 10 miles a day pushing loads up to 300lbs at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

Please email me if you think the same as me.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Sure you can. Get, for example, a &lt;a href="http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/pr2/overview" rel="nofollow"&gt;PR2 robot&lt;/a&gt; and program it accordingly. You can also use simpler robots, but in all cases, you will either end up with a ridiculous amount of cost, or with a very unreliable performance. Not mentioning the hours of programming time you will have to spend on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be better off buying a coffee maker that you can control remotely, e.g., &lt;a href="http://newatlas.com/grind-brew-smarter-coffee/35981/" rel="nofollow"&gt;via Wifi&lt;/a&gt;. Use the app to start the coffee making process once you are awake, or program your phone to detect that and start it for you. In industrial settings, robots are almost never the answer for tasks you can do without (e.g., button pressing). This is not so much different.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Using Arabica coffee beans for making instant coffee</title>

Would making a instant coffee of Arabica beans make a better quality instant coffee? Would the process making instant coffee with Arabica beans be the same?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The process should be quite the same. At least, according to this wholeseller's &lt;a href="https://m.alibaba.com/product/50015932253/100-ARABICA-SPRAY-FREEZE-DRIED-INSTANT.html?subject=100--ARABICA--SPRAY--FREEZE--DRIED--INSTANT&amp;amp;type=product&amp;amp;detailId=50015932253&amp;amp;redirect=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I understand this company sells 100% Arabica or Robusta OEM instant coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the well-known Nescafe has several brands for different blends. (I cannot reference these as they are based on many years of aggregated information of myself. I cannot even remember when I first hear some of them.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nescafe Classic is pure Robusta, but this claim is hidden recently. Still, if you Google it with keywords as "%100 percent robusta Nescafe" you may see old web pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nescafe Gold is a blend, ratios are unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More recent Nescafe Dolce Gusto is 30% Arabica, 70% Robusta. So, I doubt the Arabica ratio of Gold is less than 30%.&lt;/li&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am suffering from nervous tension and anxiety. Doctors have prescribed me regular anxiety reliever drugs and also asked me to completely stay away from tea, coffee, cola or any other beverages having caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't heed to their advice. But I do feel tense if I have coffee especially in excessive dose. However I am addicted to coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now why coffee is bad for me and how much caffeine per day is safe for me?&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Caffeine effects everyone differently, both physiologically and psychologically. &lt;strong&gt;If your doctor(s) say to avoid caffeine, I would heed their advice.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting off caffeine can be uncomfortable but totally possible - start to reduce the amount you have every day (e.g. switch from regular coffee to regular tea to decaf coffee to nothing), and you will minimize headaches. It will take time to readjust to normal (2-4 weeks for me, but again, everyone is different), but it will happen, and you will notice you feel less anxious and more calm and steady.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>French press vs simple filter, is French press equipment really necessary?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;French press coffee is basically when you pour almost boiling water onto ground beans and then filter them (by pressing the filter handle).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I wonder why use that contraption at all?&lt;br&gt;
Simply pour the hot water over the beans and then pour them in a glass over a filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there something I am missing that makes that contraption necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The simple answer is, no. You don't really need the exact French-press equipment to prepare a drinkable cup of French-press coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the equipment is very likely to ease your preparation. Otherwise, you should take care about&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;amount of water (and maybe setting the coffee/water ratio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;filter-size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;act of filtering quickly and properly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;all by yourself to have a decent cup. If you aren't experimenting or looking for adventure I advise you to pay 5 bucks for the equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does Cuban coffee include sugar?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've visited Cuba this summer. As you may guess, I visited a few coffee plantations. Also, many famous coffee houses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before my visit, I thought that “Cuban coffee” is some kind of espresso with a little bit of sugar in it added during tamping. Thus, sugar is mixed during extraction as in Turkish coffee in brew time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while was in Cuba I never ever experienced anybody added any bit of sugar in the grounds. So, I watched the whole set up carefully and realized that the sweetness in the Cuban coffee is not the result of the added sugar, but the over roasting of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I understood, the “Cuban coffee” is sweet as it is caramelized during the roasting process but not as a result of the added sugar. However, I would like to verify my observation with other coffee enthusiasts observations before finalizing my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the question could boil down to whether the Cuban coffee have additional sugar in it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help you visualize what I'm talking about, I provide a picture of some over-roasted Cuban (Caturra) beans at a plantation near Viñales, Cuba.
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ylE2V.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ylE2V.jpg" alt="Over-roasted Cuban beans (Caturra) at a plantation near Viñales, Cuba."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't say that beans that have been roasted this much are sweeter. At some point, when the bean turns black the sugars break down into carbon and a brew with those beans would be less sweet than with a standard medium espresso roast. I guess somewhere at around the second crack the sugars will be gone and only "charcoal" is left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I'm assuming they either mixed the ground coffee with the sugar before you saw the coffee or you somehow missed it otherwise. Because a sweet cup with those black charcoaly things seems unlikely if you don't put sugar in it. As far as I know cuban coffee is indeed coffee with some kind of brown raw sugar mixed in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the manufacturer does not feel that the coffee (usually whole beans) will need C02 venting, there will be ho holes or vents. That will be the case if the coffee is packaged a week or so after roasting.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is there really a NATO standard cup of coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Standards bodies do tend to occupy themselves with making standards for things, but is it just a joke?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What next, ISO standard cup of tea?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There is no such standard, it's a slang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made up standard is not only applicable to coffee, but apparently used also for tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can confirm, this standard is a counter act against NATO's will to standardize everything in between European and American armies. Tea, is quite interesting as British army likes to consume it with milk where others prefer lemon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, beverage (either tea or coffee) + milk + two sugar is known as NATO standard as an army slang. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably rooted from this, ISO 0 is another slang for beverage with milk, no sugar. And ISO 2 is the exact NATO standard.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Specific to this website, where they enlist their &lt;em&gt;"Arabica peaberry" dark roast&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;french roast&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;very strong&lt;/strong&gt;, and their &lt;em&gt;espresso&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Viennese&lt;/em&gt; blend as &lt;strong&gt;Strong&lt;/strong&gt;; I can conclude that they use roast degree as a metric for strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can easily say that it is not based on caffeine&lt;/strong&gt;, as the most stronger one is an Arabica peaberry. If it was based on caffeine amount, it should be a Robusta instead of an Arabica. We know that being a peaberry bean or not does not really influence the caffeine amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viennese blend is probably a Viennese roast. Also, an espresso blend is a quite dark roast to decrease the acidity of the overall blend. The reason is, the espresso preparation technique is known to add additional acidity to the final cup of coffee. So, roasters prepare a bit more darker roasts to decrease the acidity for coffee that will be used for espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to keep the time before coffee get out of the machine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just bought a Nuova Simonelli Musica + Eureka Mignon, so I'm practicing extracting a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to make the extraction lasts 25 sec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I start the extraction, I first have preinfusion time that last like 3-5 sec, and then the pump starting, that is lasting like 3 sec also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, at what time should I begin to count 25 sec ??? At the beginning ? After the preinfusion time ? Or when I see expresso out of the machine ?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Together with the first drop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That 25 seconds we curved in our brains is mostly related to the speed of the extraction. Mostly, under normal circumstances, with a single spout portafilter for a single shot espresso, we expect to see 1 ml per second extracted coffee. At the end, you collect 25 ml's of coffee in your cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I suggest you to count the time after you see the first drop.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have juste bought a nuova simonelli musica / eureka mignon, and I m making test with a bottomless filter.

&lt;p&gt;In the video we clearly see something is wrong. Then, when I check the filter I can see some channels in the coffee but I don't understand why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also notice some coffee on the edge, that could make me think tamper has not the good size. But, I use espro 58' the same I used on a Gaggia Classic, so it should be the good size for the musica.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Quick Homemade Great Tasting Coffee vs Price?</title>
  <body>&lt;h2&gt;Good Coffee When Working From Home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work from home and often don't have the time to go to a coffee shop to get a nice freshly brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Solutions I've Tried&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat this, I've tried various solutions such as a French Press and organic instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organic brand of instant coffee I found is a little better than other brands, but it's still almost unbearably bad unless I lace it with lots of milk and sugar, as per this question &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3020/why-instant-coffee-has-poor-reputation/3024#3024"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. However, I try to avoid sugar, especially in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the French Press tastes a little better than instant, it's a pain to use, clean and prepare, and is a little too time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Expensive Consumer Grade Coffee Machines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about getting a coffee machine but found them to be incredibly expensive with no guarantee it will last or taste any better than a French Press. And with so many variations, it's hard to know which to choose. I don't trust reviews as they are often sponsored or left by the manufacturer themselves, so it's hard to know if they are actually any good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Question&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the best way to get an experience as close as possible to a freshly brewed coffeehouse coffee without breaking the bank. Let's say the total budget is $500 USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apologies if this is a duplicate. I did look but didn't see a similar question with an answer. I will delete this question if there is one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I understand that a good coffee requires good barista skills. This question is about what equipment can help me achieve that quickly from home without breaking the bank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;If it Helps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably also important... I like a Flat White with no sugar and nice creamy milk.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are a few options you have here and 500€ is a good budget. You want good coffee throughout the day with the least amount of work possible. Also I assume you are looking for large cups of coffee since you tried instant and french press. So you should forget about espresso machines and forget about anything handmade. You need something automated for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option A: Espresso machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want coffee drinks with milk in it the way to go is to get an espresso machine. However I think for you it's not a good solution for the following reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's quite complex to get into and to be able to make good coffee. It doesn't go well with your time requirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is much more costly than the other options. Grinders for espresso start around 250€. It is in my opinion the minimum you should invest for good results, although more would be better. Decent espresso machines for home use start at 500€. It's also the minimum I would recommend you to invest. That's already way over budget. A decent alternative would be to get an electric burr grinder, a good stove top coffee maker and a milk steamer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option B: fully automated bean-to-cup machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience the coffee these machines make are pretty awful. Convenience is their strength though. A fully automated machine that makes milk based drinks automatically will set you back as much as the espresso machine/grinder setup. Though at a much lower drink quality. Jura is a famous brand for these machines. I think they may be a good solution for larger offices where everyone has different preferences as you can make black coffee as well as milk based drinks. I think you specifically have to consider the trade off between price, quality and convenience. If convenience is your main consideration you might be happy with one of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option C: Capsule machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical consumer grade, capsule or pad/pod based coffee machine is as simple as it gets. The time you need to prepare a cup of coffee is probably shorter than with any other system at the price they are charging you for the machines (you can get them for 100€ easy). However there are some downsides that disqualify these machines in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The price per coffee is way too high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They produce an insane amount of trash (this can be avoided with refillable capsules at cost of convenience).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The quality of the coffee is pretty low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue this doesn't fit your criteria since you won't get high quality coffee (plus the other downsides). I would probably prefer it to a fully automated machine though and invest some of the saved money in a decent milk steamer if you want to make milk based drinks. It's slightly more work but much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option D: Filter coffee machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this is the way to go for you. It's within your budget, fits your criteria of low maintenance and good quality and it supplies you with coffee for the entire day. Get an electric home grinder and a good filter coffee machine. For 150€ you can buy a very good electric home grinder (check Baratza) and for 200-250€ an amazing filter coffee machine (Check the SCAA approved home drip machines, I recommend Moccamaster). Handling it is extremely easy. Fill the tank with mineral water, grind the coffee (weigh it for optimal results), put it in the filter basket with the paper filter inside, turn on the machine and wait for 2min. There are many advantages over any other system when it comes to your criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparation time is low. Preparing a whole pot of coffee will only take you a couple of minutes of which you only actually work for maybe 30s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaning is extremely simple. Throw the paper filter with coffee grounds and flush the basket. Occasionally put the basket in the dish washer. Same for thermos. Flush with warm water and occasionally clean with soap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparation is extremely simple. You basically can't mess it up as long as you follow a recipe (coffee-water ratio) that the roaster can recommend you or that you find on the internet, because all the variables are preset by the machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you get a good filter coffee machine with a good thermos you will have warm coffee for half a day. So say you make one pot in the morning for breakfast. That will last you until midday. Prepare another one after lunch which will last you until the evening when you finish work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The coffee (provided that you buy good beans) will be far better than with any other automated solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your budget and your requirements I think getting good milk based drinks is difficult. Quality will always suffer greatly. If you insist on it though, I think you should buy an electric grinder, a good stove top coffee maker and a milk steamer as suggested in Option A. A bit more time consuming but better coffee as the other options (except the espresso machine). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hands down though a filter coffee machine is the way to go if you are willing to adjust yourself to black coffee. It's healthier anyways and I believe anyone who is willing to try drip coffee will come to realize that it's the far superior way to consume this wonderful beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

However, if you're experiencing side effects - such as: a migraine headache, insomnia, nervousness, irritability, restlessness, frequent urination or inability to control urination, stomach upset, fast heartbeat, muscle tremors) - to consider cutting back the amount of coffee you intake. This is true not just for those that have more than 4 cups of coffee a day, but for all who drink coffee. Some people are more susceptible to coffee's effects than others, so if you feel woozy or unsteady even after two, maybe it's a good idea to cut back. If coffee is affecting your sleep schedule, also cut back. If you use it to wake up in the morning or rely on it, perhaps going to bed sooner is a better option as sleep deprivation is one of the largest catalysts in becoming an unhealthy adult. This is not to say you should change yourself overnight, but change gradually if you decide to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

I find that if I ever have coffee past 15:00 I have insomnia that night and I'm just too jittery to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Roasted coffee beans behave differently during storage than raw ones. Heat treatment not only changes the color, smell, taste and even the size of the coffee beans, but also reveals the coffee – a bouquet of aromatic oils that evaporate very quickly. The shelf life of roasted coffee varies greatly depending on the storage conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processed grains, which are stored in a conventional, leaky container-jar or box – have a shelf life of 10-14 days.
Packaging in household conditions using foil will extend the shelf life up to 3-4 weeks.
Fried grains Packed in sealed four-layer paper bags can be stored for up to 6 months. If the packages have an additional polymer coating inside, the period increases to 9 months.
Roasted coffee beans can be stored for up to 12 months in heat-sealable film or foil-based packages. Such packages have a special gas discharge valve. It is required for freshly roasted coffee beans, after roasting, they continue to release carbon dioxide, thanks to the discovery of the smallest internal capsules. If you let the beans completely exhale, then they will be subjected to strong oxidation.Fried grains in opaque jars with hermetically lapped lids, Packed in a factory way, also have a long shelf life-up to 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee processing methode and filter brewing guide</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just recently stuck into paper filter brewing and was frustated about the brewing process of a different kind of coffee processing method( wine, natural, honey, etc).
Can someone please share their experience about the different method of brewing that you think is optimal for each beans processing methode ( grain size, temperature, brewing steps).&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In general, you need to adjust your brewing process for each coffee individually and sometimes might even tweak and change it slightly as your coffee ages. Even if some coffees might be from the same region with the same process and similar roast, their optimal brewing process can vary wildly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For filter (I assume you're using a V60 or something similar), I'd recommend the following parameters as a starting point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;97°C Water (Or boiling if your kettle doesn't have precise temperature control - the key thing is that you use the same temperature from brew to brew)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grind size such that you get a total brew time of 2min 30s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60g of coffee per 1000g (e.g. 15g to 250g) of water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you've brewed the coffee, there is no way around using your taste to adjust the parameters. For starters, try to keep everything the same except your grind size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your coffee is underextracted and tastes acidic, try grinding finer so you increase extraction and extraction time. If your coffee is overextracted and tastes bitter, try grinding coarser so that you decrease the extraction and extraction time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This compass by Barista Hustle might help you find what you need to adjust to get the kind of taste you want.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Ears feel hot and eyes twitch after a cup of coffee</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that recently, my ears feel hot just immediately after a cup of coffee. And my eyes also starts to twitch some moments later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean I should just quit taking coffee? &lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Muscle twitching, especially in the eyelids, is a very common reaction to caffeine - I myself have that problem when I drink more than 3 cups of coffee in a day. Unless the twitching makes you uncomfortable and anxious there is no need to worry too much about it. If it does worry you, you should consider reducing your daily caffeine intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the hot ears, I get those when I drink something warm like a tea (or coffee) and when I eat something spicy. This also might be a harmless effect of the caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless I would recommend you go see a doctor, or at least mention it the next time you visit one. What helped me with judging the effect of coffee on my body was to record my coffee intake and record any symptoms that might be caused by coffee. This, coupled with taking my temperature and blood pressure a few times throughout the day helped me to understand how my body reacts to certain beverages.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is a Keurig K-Cafe "shot" really an espresso shot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've been trying a Keurig K-Cafe, which includes a "Shot" feature that slowly produces what looks like a shot of espresso from a regular ("coffee") K-cup.  What is the machine doing to produce that, and is the resulting liquid comparable to "real" espresso?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I'm not enough of a connoisseur to tell the difference between straight espresso and these K-Cafe Shots.  I understand that "real" espresso is made by passing water through the grounds under high pressure.  I can't see that the K-Cafe has a mechanism to accomplish that.)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;No, sadly it's absolutely not an espresso shot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a real espresso shot the ideal settings are to have freshly ground coffee into a portefilter basket leveled and compressed using about 15kgf of force. The amount of coffee should be around 14g-18g (for a double shot) as an input, the output should be like 28-36g (we are talking about a tradtional espresso with a 1/2 ratio). All of this should be done under around 9 bar pressure. A Keurig simply doesn't respect any of theses parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m aware that the portafilter uses pressurized baskets, so tamping and grind size is not as critical as on more professional espresso machines. But as a consumer machine that allows you the flexibility of using your own coffee grounds, a decent grinder that executes a grind size this Dedica EC685 can use would be ideal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What grinder (whether burr/blade) is a good grinder that allows the optimum grind size for the pressurized baskets on the Dedica EC685, as well as offering you enough range to grind coarser for pour overs, drips &amp;amp; french presses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you recommend something like the KRUPS GVX2 (my current grinder) with only 16-18 grind settings? [incidentally this functions, and offers almost identical performance to the DeLonghi KG 79]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or would your recommend a Baratza Encore or Virtuoso, with 40 grind settings? Or something even higher pro model grinder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For users of this Dedica EC685, what grinders are you using and are happy with? (Brands, models &amp;amp; types, please)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If I were you I'd go with the baratza encore (or something similar). It will do just fine for a pressurised basket and it's great for filter too (if James Hoffman uses it for his filter it's good enough for you and me). Don't buy a blade grinder, I've made that mistake. You will taste a huge difference between the two, the blade grinder being bitter and yucky. It's all about particle distribution and a blade grinder does the worst possible job at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, spend the money for a decent burr grinder and you won't only have better espresso; you can make delicious filter coffee too!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Cleaning a stovetop espresso maker (moka pot) before first use</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;How should a Moka pot be cleaned before first use and does this depend on what it's made of (aluminium or stainless steel)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like with most Moka-related things, I'm finding a lot of different information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use only warm water (&lt;a href="https://www.bialetti.us/coffee/stovetop/moka-express-c-1_7_22.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use soapy water (&lt;a href="https://www.bialetti.us/coffee/stovetop/stainless-pots/venus-c-1_7_21_35.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;, only applies to stainless steel Venus, &lt;a href="https://www.bialetti.co.nz/blogs/making-great-coffee/tips-and-care" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;another source&lt;/a&gt; specifically says not to do this on aluminium)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use water with a tablespoon of salt (&lt;a href="https://www.moka-pot.co.uk/moka-pot-first-use.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use water with vinegar or baking soda (&lt;a href="https://caffevergnano.us/blog/lifestyle/moka-pot-new-obtain-good-coffee-right-away/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this first clean, most sources seem to agree it's good to make a few batches of coffee and throw them away. But I'm curious what I should do prior to this and if there's any point to using vinegar / salt / baking soda?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Check for metal shavings, grind the bottom flat (if needed). Remove the filter and sealing in the top part to check there as well.
Mild soap can be used to remove leftover oils from machining (if present).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Aluminium moka pots, don't use anything abrasive or even midly aggressive (acidic or alkaline) as it will attack the aluminium, instead use coffe to let a protective oil film build up. Some cloth or paper towels can be used to reduce the "patina" from time to time. Immediatly rinsing with water after use (the top part) will keep coffee from drying and sticking and also keep the oil film intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stainless variants are pretty much immune to wear, except the sealing. However, the filter (in the top part) might also be made from aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is it possible to airlock a V60 brew?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm brewing coffee on a V60 mounted directly on the mug that will be used for drinking the coffee (no dripstations). Starting from the third pour, the water was taking too long to go through the filter, making the total brewing time of my cup (300ml) was around 7 minutes, while I was trying to replicate the 4:6 method by Tetsu Kasuya, which takes around 3 minutes and a half. After watching a video about the design of a Chemex and its side channel that lets air flow from the down chamber out of the system to prevent airlocks, I thought that the same could be happening in my system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a way of counteracting this, I've 3d printed three pieces that I can attach to my mug and create a gap between the V60 and the mug, shown in the Picture &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5le1L.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time I got an weighting scale (I didn't use one before this) and my brewing time was significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that I'm overthinking the problem and the pieces aren't doing anything, and the brewing was faster just by using proper amounts on each pour (by using a scale)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5le1L.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5le1L.png" alt="Brewing setup with the V60" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Looking at the question from another angle, there’s nothing that would &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; an airlock, except your little pieces, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chance that the filter holder and the cup rim fit so perfectly for an instant lock is slim, but you shouldn’t underestimate the power to a bit of condensation when it comes to creating a seal. I had a similar problem just the other week when bottling hot syrup with a funnel without ridges: The first one or two were fine, after that, I got that splashing whenever the water film tore for a moment and ultimately had to lift the funnel ever so slightly over the bottle rim to ensure a steady flow. I have had issues with airlock when using a porcelain Melitta filter holder, so I can totally confirm that some types of filter holders do tend to seal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even one of your plastic pieces should already be enough to prevent the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>freddo espresso pods vs espresso pods</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'd like to consider myself a newbie at...coffee...consumption and I wanted to buy an espresso machine for myself and right now I'm between, a nespresso machine and a dolce gusto machine and the only thing that is holding me back is that, I can find freddo espresso pods for the dolce gusto machine but not for the nespresso one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that freddo means &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt;, but I don't know if there is a point in having different pods for freddo espresso and &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; espresso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, does anyone know, in they're experience, if there is a difference between the two types of pods?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How should I clean my Wilfa grinder?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have owned a Wilfa coffee grinder for about 2 years now and use it daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wondering how I should clean it? I noticed you can buy grinder cleaning aids but wanted to check with everyone here first.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The owner's manual for your specific model should have good instructions. There are good tips and videos online for other grinders, but I don't know how well they apply to yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea is to gently remove the hopper, bin, gasket, and similar parts, and remove whichever side(s) of the blades are designed to come out. Vacuum out the coffee dust, then use a small wire brush to loosen more coffee grounds, and vacuum again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thin wood kabob skewer is a good tool for cleaning the corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hopper and such parts are probably washable. Do not get water on the grinder blades unless the manual says that's OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not used cleaning pellets but I'm skeptical that pushing additional stuff through will clean out the accumulated dust and oils from the path. If you do try pellets, follow them with some coffee beans as a &amp;quot;chaser&amp;quot; to minimize the pellet dust in your next batch of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Gifting coffee beans, how to put effort into them and make their taste interesting</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am an amateur when it comes to coffee. My dad drinks a lot of coffee and enjoys preparing his coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have bought him a coffee grinder for his birthday (he usually just buys ground coffee). I have also bought green coffee beans to roast. Is there anything more I can do besides roasting the coffee beans ? I would like to show I put effort into them and give them a unique taste. I have plenty time and coffee for trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there anything more I can do besides roasting the coffee beans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure you can even roast them - at least probably not properly. Roasting coffee requires precise temperature control which is incredibly hard to achieve with a popcorn machine, an oven or a pan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to show I put effort into them and give them a unique taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After picking the coffee cherry you cannot really add any quality or characteristics to the bean. The whole process can be seen as a series of windows - if everything is done well, you can see the coffee and its origin characteristics. If something is not done well, the window gets stained and the view on the coffee gets muddy. The main thing you add with roasting is sweetness, notes that go into the chocolatey and nutty area and bitter/burnt aromas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have plenty time and coffee for trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really do want to roast them yourself despite not having the ideal tools for it there are several things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure all of the beans are roasted evenly. This means keeping them moving a lot and not letting some beans be in contact with the heat source for too long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not roast them beyond the second crack if your father does not like overly bitter coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're dealing with temperatures of above 200°C, take appropriate precautions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove any defects like chipped beans or quakers afterwards so they don't negatively impact the taste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  <title>Fix my Breville coffee machine filter holder</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Ok, so basically 6 years ago I bought a &lt;a href="https://www.ereplacementparts.com/breville-bes250xl-cafe-venezia-espresso-machine-parts-c-116052_116055_116075.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Breville Venezia espresso coffee maker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really happy with the machine, as it still works after 6 years of relatively frequent use. But recently out of the blue, my filter holder had an issue where the flow divider just burst free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next picture shows the parts I'm referring to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MQJav.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MQJav.jpg" alt="Parts of filter holder" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried fixing it back, it stuck for a couple of minutes and then burst out again. I tried fixing it hard, but as soon as I pushed the filter eject button, the whole structure burst out again. I tried looking for new ones, but as it often happens with coffee machines, the spare parts end up costing almost the same as the coffee machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found some options on ebay, but the average price went around 60-70 USD for the filter holder, and for a machine that cost me about 250 USD, I am not sure if it's worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it feasible to stick the flow divider with silicone or some kind of glue? I mean the filter has some clipping mechanisms, but I think they no longer hold, so would a permanent glue / fixing work for this? Is there some health risk related to the glue / silicone and the coffee? I mean the flow divider has small tubes that exit the whole metal structure and where the ejector button is, there's a small rubber isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had the budget I would probably look for something more Pro level, but it's not an option at the moment and as I mentioned earlier, it works fine, except for this tiny issue.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I had been using an espresso maker for several years, but the group head on that is a lot less complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I understand the picture, the small part with spring sits on top of the grey clamp at the bottom of the group head, and the diverter sits on top of the spring, then the actual filter basket (pressurized?) is on top of this diverter? Sounds like this diverter can't get fasten to the group head anymore, so the spring pushes it out to burst as you said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't quite understand the point of the spring. The group head on my old machine looks like this:
&lt;a href="https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/t_share/MTc0NjIwODYwMDg5NTc1NDE0/review-of-the-oster-prima-latte-espresso-cappuccino-and-latte-maker.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/t_share/MTc0NjIwODYwMDg5NTc1NDE0/review-of-the-oster-prima-latte-espresso-cappuccino-and-latte-maker.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can skip the spring part, and put this filter holder in just to make sure the two exit holes align well, then use the machine as usual? You may need to take things apart to clean after each use.. but sounds like that shouldn't be too hard?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to froth milk for latte art with a delonghi magnifica</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to get started with latte art. The problem is that I can’t draw because the milk just flows into the coffee. Only the foam on the top remains but that in turn is too light to allow any pattern. I assume that I am doing something wrong in the frothing process.
I‘m using the integrated milk frother of a delonghi magnifica with whole milk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First I try to let some air into the milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I dip the frother into the  milk until the volume increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do this until the container gets slightly too hot to hold (have seen it in a video).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any suggestions on how to improve?
Does the behavior above indicate that the milk is too cold?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Appreciate any advice. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR;&lt;/strong&gt; Remove the outer panarello leaving just the inner steam tip. Turn the jug at a 45 degree angle and try to get the milk to spin round in a vortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detail:&lt;/strong&gt; The panarello brings in extra air to make the frothing and steaming of the milk a much more consistent, reliable process. Unfortunately, from a latte perspective, the bubbles end up being too big and are more suited to frothy cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had this machine for two years and had given up on any chance of proper latte art. Then, in searching for supporting evidence before answering you, I found &lt;a href="https://coffeeblog.co.uk/delonghi-magnifica-esam-4200-review/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this Magnifica review&lt;/a&gt; where the reviewer says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popular option with domestic Espresso machines are panarello
wands, a sheath which covers the steam pipe and introduces steam to
the milk via holes on the side. ... They produce only large bubbled
froth, to be spooned into cappuccino – which is fine if that’s what
you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, however, you’re wanting to produce lovely, shiny microfoam, with
much smaller bubbles, for making delicious velvety flat whites,
cortado/piccolo, macchiato, latte or cappuccino, and to have a go at
pouring latte art, then panarello isn’t going to work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;De’Longhi have recognized this, and they have made it very easy to
simply pull off the panarello to reveal the plastic steam pipe, which
is essentially a single hole steam tip steam wand&lt;/strong&gt;, or at least works
in a similar fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, it's doubtful that this was actually De'Longhi's intention. Without the outer panarello screwed in, the steam tip is held in place only by friction and - at least once it has been removed and replaced a few times - will frequently pop out from the pressure of the steam. Trying to hold it in place with your thumb or finger is tricky, risks burning your hand and (most importantly!) distracts you from keeping the milk jug in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried it a few times and the results have been mixed. Microfoam is certainly more achievable, but so is completely flat, textureless milk! However, there's enough potential there that I'm going to spend a small amount of money on a new panarello and then cut it shorter with a saw so that it can hold the tip in place without adding unnecessary extra air to the milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: Rather than cutting anything, you could also put your finger over the little dimple through which air is added. Still be careful of touching the hot chrome arm.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Yes they do, provided you remove the portafilter holder and don't put dosing cup too far away from the hole, it is only as wide as a portafilter after all so there could be some spilt grounds if it's not close enough.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is diluting filter concentrate after the brew the same as brewing with the additional water?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Recently moved from a Clever Drip coffee maker to an Aeropress. I brew using a 60g to 1 ltr ratio often brewing 24g yielding 400ml on the clever drip and 12g to 200ml on the Aeropress. If I am brewing for 3 people should I brew 3 batches 12g/200ml or something like 36g/150ml and dilute the concetrate with 450ml of water?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Is diluting filter concentrate after the brew the same as brewing with the additional water?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;No it is not the same. The brew ratio is important to extract the right amount of solubles from the coffee, ideally all the pleasant ones and only few of the unpleasant ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you brew with less water, you'll dissolve less of the coffee's goodness, and diluting that will lead to a thin coffee compared to a correctly brewed one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if you brew with too much water, you'll extract bitter substances you won't like, so if you like a thinner coffe (like an americano) it's best to brew normally and then dilute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Aeropress is not really suitable to serve multiple guests.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This may be an anecdotal answer, but it's coming from a friend that really cares that their aluminium moka pot stays in a prime condition as long as possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to minimize visual changes in your moka pot, make sure to rinse it (do not use soap) right after use, wipe it with a dry cloth afterwards, and do not reassemble it until it's dry (as it will trap the remaining moisture in the chamber which causes the aluminium to oxidise, changing the colour). That should slow down the process significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is the Baratza Virtuozo+ worth it compared to the Encore?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;So I am kinda looking around for an upgraded coffee grinder. I am currently using a Braun KG7070. Super cheap, so not exceptionally good and doesn't really provide consistent grinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was looking around and the most obvious grinder seems to be the Baratza Encore. Used a lot and I heard good things about it. But I also saw that the Baratza Virtuozo+ provides even better grind quality. But it also costs about €100,- more. So I was wondering, is the Virtuozo+ worth it's money or should I go for the Encore?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I basically brew french press and pour-over currently. I know both aren't really well suited for espresso grinds, but I am not interested in that anyway so that isn't a problem for me.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;You can upgrade the Encore with the burrs from the Virtuozo if you are handy with some basic tools. So even if you started with the Encore and then down the road decided you wanted an upgrade, you could spend just €40 and get the same grind quality.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Reroasting coffee beans after a couple of years - is it worth it?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have some old, roasted coffee beans that have been stored in (mostly) airtight, opaque containers. The coffee beans are of reputable brands and are 2-6 years old, depending on the bag. They do not smell stale, but the flavorful coffee smell is mostly gone or barely there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am wondering if I can reroast them myself at home and still use them in my espresso machine or if I should throw them out. The reason I have so much unused coffee that's so old is that I stopped drinking coffee for a while, but now I am back and would like to give it another try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I would discard them. The flavor is &lt;em&gt;developed&lt;/em&gt; by roasting, but once it’s gone, it’s gone. We are talking about volatile aromatic compounds, that likely have degraded or evaporated (yes, it may even happen in mostly airtight containers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-roasting may create some more, but assuming that the original roast was “as intended”, you would likely create unwelcome notes, like bitterness or burnt flavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a good chance that the oils have oxidized, i.e. gone rancid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing wrong with giving it a try, but I wouldn’t expect results worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Anyone using La Pavoni EDL Eurobar Deluxe? Comments? Reviews?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Hello Dear Coffee Experts,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in advance very grateful for any advise you can provide me.
I am testing an espresso coffee machine from one of my colleagues who just upgraded his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He bought a Lelit and is now selling his 2004 La Pavoni EDL Eurobar Deluxe. Although I know it is a good brand I have been unable to find good reviews about this specific model. Does anyone have comments, reviews or advise? He lend it to me and I have been testing it for the past 3 days but I am not an expert. I wonder if at the price he is selling it to me I should take it (114 USD). I was planning to buy something in the 650 USD range but if this is an incredible deal then please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again and I look forward to your knowledgeable advise,&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to make a thick coffee with an AeroPress? I end up with a watery drink and an over-brewed aftertaste</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I got an AeroPress about a week ago and I have been experimenting with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm in a temporary country until the rest of the year and I am getting ground coffee online (can only have decaf), so I do NOT control the grind size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like thick coffees and I bought a metal filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the inverted method, I put one scoop of coffee and then I tried various amount of water for the brew + some dilution afterward. I have tried two different decaf Arabicas from Amazon and I use 80°C water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most of the results end up the same way: a very watery feel without any texture, a taste that is not very palatable but a very strong over-brewed aftertaste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I doing wrong? and how can I make it thicker? Can I create crema with the AeroPress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;edit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is the grind size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vgkbe.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vgkbe.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to make the texture of your coffee thicker would be to increase your brew ratio - use more coffee and less water while brewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also don't be scared to use higher temperature water, even if the inventor recommends ~80°C water, this is also going to increase extraction, leading to a higher percentage of dissolved coffee in your cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also want to look at this &amp;quot;Coffee Compass&amp;quot; from Barista Hustle, which shows you what adjustments to make based on the taste of the coffee:&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Left on the stovetop without water -- do I need a new moka pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I put my moka pot &amp;amp; coffee on the stove this morning and forgot to put water into the bottom. Definitely a strong burnt rubber and burnt coffee smell before I noticed it; the rubber gasket was warped and it stuck to the top part a bit while I was trying to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caramel topping may have hints of coffee flavor but technically it is not made with coffee.  It is melted sugar, melted to a slightly burnt state called caramelized sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is all Ethiopian coffee considered Specialty Grade 1? If so, where can I buy some in Canada?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I was recently introduced to Ethiopian coffee, specifically, a flavour called Honey washed Dawi and Sidamo. They had wonderful aromas and tasted a little bit fruity as well. I did some research and learned that Ethiopian coffee grows at a higher elevation than other coffees, which is why it tastes the way it does. Then, I learned about Specialty Grade 1 coffee that is usually from Ethiopia. Where can I get Grade 1 coffee in Canada?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="https://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://buycoffeecanada" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://buycoffeecanada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://etcoffee.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://etcoffee.com/&lt;/a&gt; Has anyone purchased from these vendors before?

&lt;p&gt;How often should I clean it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It really depends on how much coffee you grind per day. Say, If you're going through about 100 gm (or lower even) of coffee every day, you should clean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beans chute and the burrs once a month or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grinds catch around once a week. Your grinds catch needs cleaning more often than the chute and the burrs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also for the chute or any of the internals (especially the burrs), Don't use water for cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Clean the grinds catch often and rest once a month or two for regular coffee use.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Aeropress: at what stage does most of extraction happen?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;While making coffee using the Aeropress, there are a number of stages that happen in sequence. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial pour of small quantity of hot water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stirring for about 10-20 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pouring of the rest of the hot water (till desired water ratio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait time (usually 1 minute)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stir again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invert, and press for ~30 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question: &lt;strong&gt;During which of these stages does the &amp;quot;extraction&amp;quot; (from coffee to the water) happen for the most part?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Generally, the &amp;quot;extraction&amp;quot; happens when the coffee is in contact with the water. So from the initial point of contact in this case the bloom phase pour till all the water (with dissolved solids) is removed from contact with the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking, The initial small quantity pour and stirring in your recipe is the bloom phase and the second pour, stir and press would be the main extraction phase. In the case of your recipe, most of your extraction would happen during the second wait phase &amp;quot;Wait time (usually 1 minute)&amp;quot;, followed by the second stir phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first bloom phase is usually to let the coffee expunge as much CO2 as possible that's trapped from the roasting process. The CO2, when dissolved can make the coffee more acidic/bitter, hence the blooming phase in your recipe to mitigate that. There is also some extraction during this phase but is rather dwarfed in comparison to the main extraction phase.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Return it. Forget about heavy metal poisoning. That's not a big concern. The bigger concern is that you'll never be able to clean inside those scratches.

  <title>How to reduce acidity (and increase strength) of moka pot coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I drink coffee, from a stovetop moka pot. I do not add anything to it. No milk, no sugar, no water. Just the output of the moka pot is drunk, by me (not sure, if that is the norm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read in some places, including other questions in this SE, that to reduce acidity, one must allow water to be in contact with coffee, for a longer duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried to reduce the flame, as soon as the coffee starts pouring into the top part of the moka pot, to increase the time of brewing. However, this only seems to marginally decrease the acidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee also doesn't seem strong enough. Is there any way to increase strength, and decrease the acidity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better way of doing what I tried is also appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I am looking for ways to archive result by changing brewing methods, and not means.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Both issues you're describing, high acidity and weak body, are most probably a result of under-extraction. To increase the balance of the brewed coffee and get a more intense body by increased extraction you have several choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longer brew time. As you said, this is difficult to achieve with a moka pot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased temperature. This is also practically uncontrollable with a moka pot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grind finer. This is probably the variable which has the most effect on your brew. If you grind finer, you get more surface area and higher extraction (all else being equal of course). Keep in mind this will make your coffee less acidic but also more bitter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, a moka pot doesn't allow for much customization and precise adjustments. The only thing I can strongly recommend is to keep everything you're doing the same from brew to brew and only adjust the grind size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't own a grinder and use pre-ground coffee I'm afraid you're out of luck. Getting a cheap-ish hand grinder (usable and consistent hand grinders are available for 30-50$/€) and using freshly ground beans instead of pre-ground coffee is an upgrade I &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;strongly recommend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s a dumb question, but I made French press coffee for first time using kicking horse smart ass beans, and the taste was very much like instant coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t have the metallic taste you can get from instant coffee and was smoother and not bitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the effect of the coffee was wonderful, I really felt picked up without any jittery feeling and very alert and focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually drink Tim Hortons, and I don’t get the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I really like the Tim Hortons flavour better.  The French press coffee was very one note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe is the beans?  Should I try a lighter blend?  I’ll get through the ones I have now, maybe it will grow on me.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use better coffee or adjust your recipe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to make espresso in a Bodum French press coffee machine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Espresso beans were ground coarse instead of fine.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;h1&gt;No&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way of brewing espresso with a french press.
Es&lt;strong&gt;press&lt;/strong&gt;o is brewed under &lt;strong&gt;press&lt;/strong&gt;ure, typically 9-10 bars.
You cannot achieve this level of pressure no matter which brand your french press has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the TDS (total dissolved solids) of espresso &lt;a href="https://fellowproducts.com/blogs/learn/the-beginner-s-guide-to-total-dissolved-solids-and-coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;is around 8-12 while for french press coffee it's 1.4-1.7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you can get a cup of coffee which has more texture and a fuller body than filter coffee by &lt;a href="https://www.baristahustle.com/wp-content/uploads/images/products/products-Coffee-Compass-1024x1024.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;grinding finer and increasing your dose&lt;/a&gt;. It won't come anywhere near espresso but it's not as &amp;quot;watery&amp;quot; as filter coffee. Being able to adjust your recipe for taste like this is one of the many advantages of buying your coffee in beans and grinding them before use.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does my coffee machine trip the electrical circuit during or shortly after brewing?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My Delonghi Magnifica ESAM 4200.s trips the electrical circuit.  When I reset the trip switch it continues it’s process. This happens every time whichever plug socket I use, even in a different house. No error lights are displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;If you have observed the problem &lt;em&gt;on different outlets&lt;/em&gt; and even &lt;em&gt;in different houses&lt;/em&gt;, the only &lt;em&gt;common&lt;/em&gt; factor is the machine itself. The exact cause can’t be assessed via the Internet and unless you are experienced with repairing electrical machinery, I would &lt;strong&gt;strongly discourage&lt;/strong&gt; you to start experimenting blindly. The missing error lights are not an indicator here, they would only signal a problem that an otherwise functional machine can detect via the built-in self-checks. Tripping a circuit breaker is in a different league of defect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your own safety: &lt;strong&gt;Please stop using the machine&lt;/strong&gt; (faulty electric alone is bad enough, add water to the mix and it gets really dangerous), even if it seems to “work”, sort of. Contact a qualified service technician or the seller/manufacturer (especially if it’s still under warranty) and have them assess the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

<pregunta>
  <title>Ideal brewing time for 3-cup Chemex?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm not very good with judging grind sizes, so one method I read about was, instead of focusing so much on grind size pay attention to the brew time. If the brew takes too long, the coffee grounds are too fine, but if the brew time is too short then the coffee is too coarse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like this method, and the estimated ranges I've come across for pour over is 2:30 mins to 4 mins (i.e., it should be no faster than 2:30min, but take no longer than 4 mins)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I feel like around 3 mins is the sweet spot for my usual choice of coffee and a 3-cup Chemex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there just one ideal brewing time (or time window) or does that differ depending on the roast or other factors? How would I recognize a too long or too short brewing time in the finished product?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Ideal brewing time varies based on grind. Finer grinds need shorter brew times. Coarser grinds need longer brew times. This is because fine grinds expose more surface area of the beans, which lets solutes diffuse quickly into the water. Coarse grinds need more time for solutes to be drawn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for roast level, that's totally up to you. Different roast levels expose different flavor profiles, so you might like them all brewed for the same amount of time or you might prefer to brew darker or lighter roasts for longer or shorter times. There's not really an ideal here unless you align with the preferences of the person offering you the ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll know that your brew time is too long if your coffee tastes bitter. Coffee brewed perfectly should taste very smooth if you're using medium or lighter roasts. Very dark coffees might taste bitter in a burnt sort of way even with perfect brewing. Conversely, too short brew time will result in weak tasting coffee. Note that weak coffee can also be caused by too high of a water to grounds ratio or poor contact between water and grinds (channeling during the pour). Bloom to help mitigate channeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this info helps!&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have gone on vacation for a month and forgot to clean my mug thay i left on the counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im scared that after washing it out with soap and HOT water it isn't safe to drink out of. i boiled water in the kettle and let the boiled water sit in the mug for 10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very special mug and i would hate to throw it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it safe??&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you clean it by either putting it in a dishwasher on a high temperature setting or sterilizing it with boiling water, you will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not specifically a question about coffee but about food safety in general, so usual measures apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrape off as much of the mold as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the dish into (boiling) hot water for at least 15min&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a similar procedure to preparing glass jars for jam, you try to boil away as much bacteria and funghi as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why do espresso grains have to be finely ground and French press grains coursely ground?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Why do espresso grains have to be finely ground?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(I've seen some moka pot instructions say medium is good, too.)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought espresso machines extracted the most out of the grains, so it would seem they wouldn't need to be finely ground—that fine-ground would be suited for French press (lower temps &amp;amp; pressure, no?) and course ground for espresso (the exact opposite of what's recommended!).&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Coffee brewing is simple physics and chemistry. In short, soluble compounds and oils migrate from the beans to the water. The extraction will depend on temperature, pressure and contact area between beans and water. There’s also a balance between desired and less desired flavor compounds (e.g. acidic and bitter) that a specific brewing method needs to manage, so you tweak the given parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a coarse grind, the total surface area is smaller, so to get a comparable extraction you need more time (minutes for hot water as in French press, hours for cold water as in cold brew). For finer and fine grinds, you brew shorter (pour over) and probably increase the pressure (espresso).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course you can also look at the problem in reverse, like in the question (“how much can method X extract”), and match the grind size to hit the optimum. However, there your assumption that e.g. an espresso machine can extract &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; is incorrect. The very short time plus the compact grounds means that comparatively little coffee flavor is extracted - but some would say that it’s the best parts ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Question about dirt/rust moka pot</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Today I decided that I want to improve the quality of the coffee I'm consuming, so I decided to start brewing coffee at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Pedrini moka pot that was stored for a few years without use.
Currently this is the status of the moka pot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7hcee.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7hcee.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
I tried using lemon vinegar and baking soda and the stains of the water reserve didn't change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I replace the pot? Is it safe to use it? Should I buy a stainless one?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's a combination of scale (mineral deposits left behind by water left in the pot evaporating), oxidized aluminum (caused by exposure of aluminum to oxygen), and coffee deposits (coffee oils and solids left behind by evaporating brew / wet grounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen this with several aluminum pots when they get to be years old. Also steel if you don't keep up with the cleaning. You can remove scale with a coffee machine descaler product (recommend DEZCAL by Urnex), oxidized aluminum with a diluted solution of vinegar, and coffee deposits with a mix of vinegar and baking soda (mixed in the pot with your cleaning tool on standby because they will start reacting immediately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just one bit of advice. Use a rotary tool (like Dremel, if you have one) with a buffing pad. You're going to have one tough time cleaning inside those grooves using a scrubbing pad. A rotary tool with a soft attachment like for polishing or buffing will make the job much easier. Electric toothbrushes work wonderfully too in places they can actually fit/reach.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What's an easy method for cleaning used coffee grounds out of a french press?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My favorite method for brewing coffee &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be a french press. However to me the biggest downside of it is cleaning it afterwards. Unlike, for example, using a disposable drip filter, which can easily be removed grounds and all and then composted, the grounds are all mushed on to the bottom of the french press and difficult to remove without making at least a little bit of a mess. (Oftentimes I end up making a big mess because I'm clumsy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any tricks I can use or cleaning methods I may not know about that can make cleaning this brewing method easier and more convenient?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dishwasher. Serious godsend for cleaning French press filters. Just make sure that the filter is flat inside the dishwasher. Standing it up might save space, but it also prevents a thorough cleaning because the water from the dishwasher jets doesn't hit the holes in the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't have a dishwasher but do have a spray wand on your sink, try this. Put the spray wand flush against the filter, turn your water on full pressure (or less if you have crazy high water pressure), and &amp;quot;pressure wash&amp;quot;. The filter itself will slightly inhibit the flow of water and create good pressure to push coffee out of the holes. If you do this, spray into the top face of the filter, since coffee would have entered the filter from the bottom. This makes it so fewer to no pieces get stuck if they're too big to squeeze through the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawn, Dawn, Dawn, Dawn... DAWN! Squeeze a little bit of Dawn dishwashing detergent into a large mixing bowl or a stopped sink, then fill to about 3&amp;quot; depth with water. When you have enough, stir it up to mix the detergent and water. Then soak the filter for 5-10 minutes. When done soaking, come up and pull the filter up and push it back down into the water. The detergent will loosen coffee oils and help the agitated water push the coffee bits out. You might then need to lightly scrub the bottom of the filter with a sponge to get the rest, but the agitation should take care of most of it. For the cup, just add some Dawn to the cup (coffee and all), stir, if you have a tight lid put it on and shake like mad, then take the lid off, put the filter in (don't press tight though, just enough to loosely hold the grinds on the cup), and dump the water out. After that you should be able to just spoon out the grinds into the trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the cup itself is stained, consider this ONLY IF your French press is made of STAINLESS STEEL. There is a product in the dishwashing section of most grocery and department stores called Barkeeper's Friend. This stuff works a treat on tough stains on stainless steel, but it can damage soft materials. Never use on plastic and consult product documentation for any other material. Unfortunately it won't help much with the filter because the problem with the filter is things getting stuck in the holes, but the cup... Woo boy. It'll get clean, though depending on the type and severity of the stain it might take some elbow grease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If either your cup or your filter has fallen victim to water scale, use a commercial descaler like Urnex's DEZCAL. Just dissolve the descaler powder in the recommended amount of water stated on product packaging, soak the affected part for about five minutes, rinse, and repeat. Twice should be enough to take care of bad scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope these tips help!&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Not a good idea. Electronic kettles usually contain PVC or other plastic parts in the electronics. During normal operation, the heating element might be located far enough away or insulated from the plastic parts, but on the stovetop that insulating strategy will likely be ineffective. Never use electronic cookware on the stove unless product documentation specifically states support for that use case.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>In search of a Hot Bean to Coffee Cup Machine</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have just returned the De'Longhi Eletta Cappuccino ECAM44.660.B Bean to Cup Coffee Machine. Not because it didn't make nice coffee, but because the coffee was luke warm within seconds of drinking. Basically, the coffee was never hot. I followed the instructions to make it hot i.e. Place coffee cup on hot metal tray before dispensing the coffee, heating the coffee cup with hot water before pouring the coffee, plus many other suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have googled for hot bean to cup coffee machine, and the general impression is that I will never be able to purchase a machine that will produce really hot coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can someone let me know if it is indeed possible to purchase a hot bean to cup coffee machine?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The problem (for you) with espresso is that the amount of coffee brewed per serving is small and it tends to lose heat faster than, let's say, a mug of filter-brew coffee from a jar that has been sitting on a hot plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found some interesting information on:
&lt;a href="https://www.1stincoffee.com/art-of-making-espresso" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.1stincoffee.com/art-of-making-espresso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brewing temperature is the temperature of the water at the point
where it comes into contact with the ground coffee. This temperature
is controlled by the thermostat of the espresso machine and should be
88C to 91C. The temperature of the brew in your cup will be between 71
and 74C. The heat loss occurs in the brew group, the air, and the cup.
This is the ideal temperature for espresso in order to feel hot
without scalding. To keep the beverage temperature from being too low,
you should preheat the brew group and the cup. The easiest and most
reliable way to heat the brew group and the cup is to run the cycle
once with water only. This will heat the brew group, including the
portafilter, and the cup simultaneously. A cup warmer will also help
keep cups warm when you are making multiple espresso beverages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my experience, excessively hot espressos ( &amp;gt; 80C ) like the ones served in restaurants in my country tend to yield a horrible burnt taste and are a telltale of a bad barista or a malfunctioning machine&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Counter top refrigeration of dairy creamer carton?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've set up a coffee/drink bar complete with coffee, espresso machine, various sweeteners, stirring sticks, teas, liquors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the one thing missing at the bar is the creamer: we use half-and-half which requires refrigeration. So every time I make a drink that uses creamer I need to make a walk to the kitchen refrigerator to get the creamer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6x5LN.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6x5LN.png" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've thought of a few ways to solve this problem, but they all fall short for various reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use those small 1-tsp sized creamer cups which aren't refrigerated - way more costly per oz than a carton of half-n-half and opening several of them when making drinks for the family is a hassle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use powdered creamer - ech!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install a mini fridge at the bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last option is the closest to what I'd like, but the smallest mini-fridge at my local Home Depot is still large enough to fit ~10-15 of these cartons which seems like overkill. Also they don't fit on top of the counter, so I'd need to remove a cabinet from under the counter, and hiring a carpenter just to get my creamer closer to my coffee also seems quite overkill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone here with the same issue as me come up with an elegant solution?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can a blade grinder really not grind fine enough for espresso?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've often heard it claimed blade grinders cannot grind fine enough to make espresso, but is this true? I've run my cheap blade grinder continuously until its humming sound becomes steady and smooth (about 30 seconds), indicating the blade isn't hitting any larger-sized chunks, and it produces very fine, seemingly homogeneous, powdery grinds, and works well with my moka.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Blade grinders cannot produce homogenous grinds, even if they may seem so to the eye. Additionally, you can't control grind size precisely and consistently, which is important for espresso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grind size and size distribution, have a crucial impact on extraction under the conditions of an espresso machine (high pressure, short extraction time). An important part of &amp;quot;dialing in&amp;quot; a good espresso shot consists of finding the correct grind, which then needs to be reproduced consistently for subsequent shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moka pots are much more forgiving, due to their lower pressure and longer extraction time, and do best with a considerably coarser grind than espresso machines.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to fix lack of finish in a v60 with very acidic grounds</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I just got a new batch of beans and am having trouble brewing a cup with a decent finish. The flavor on my cups just seems to disappear in a matter of seconds after actually drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched online and that seems to be an indication of under extraction. With that in mind, I ground a bit finer which, despite massively increasing drawdown time, didn't fix the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using James Hoffman's recipe of 15g/250g, 45 sec bloom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes on the beans, which I suspect might help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazilian origin (yellow/red catuai)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Floral/citrus notes, which I kinda get, but not much&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roasted Jan 20th&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I just push the grind finer still? Are the beans just more conducive to a quicker finish and I just discovered that they're not my favorite? Something else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that with my previous brews this didn't seem to be an issue. So I doubt that my grinder, albeit cheap (crushgrind colombia) is the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did try already, with varying degrees of success:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making sure the water is as hot as possible by reapplying heat when waiting for the bloom and pouring straight from the boiler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing the ratio by about 10% (my scale only has 1g sensitivity)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This added &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; finish to the coffee, but not near what I get with different beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I experiment, the more I'm convinced I'm just not a fan of this particular bean profile flavor because I'm starting to get some bitterness which would indicate that I'm actually overextracting now.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Milk not frothing with the French press technique</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Basically I'm trying to recreate the technique of aerating milk by pouring milk into a French press and oscillating the piston through the liquid. I've been using cold milk, and, the issue is my milk is simply not frothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could be the possible reasons why my milk is not frothing?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm not familiar with frothing milk with a French press, but if you use a mechanical frother you need to warm up the milk to about 60-65 °C so the foam bubbles will remain intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience the easiest way to do that is using a microwave, but you have to figure out the right power settings and timing, depending on your container, and volume and initial temperature of the milk.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>French Press Coffee too sour</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am making a French Press coffee from my pre-ground coffee that I get from my local coffee shop. I store it in an air-tight container and brew it like such&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add 11 grams of coffee in the french press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add 225 ml of just of the boil water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix and wait for 4 mins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scoop the top sludge after a small stir and wait for another 2-3 mins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could be the cause of the coffee being too sour ?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In a comment, you mentioned that the problem seemed to be the beans.  Ground coffee doesn't stay fresh very long, even in an air-tight container.  But several other things pop out in the question that you could also look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often start with a coarse grind for French Press, then brew it for a very long time to extract the flavor.  That can over-extract undesirable flavors.  To extract the flavor from inside coarse chunks, the outside of the chunk, and smaller particles, gets over-extracted.  Try a slightly finer grind with a shorter brew time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're using a 1:20.5 ratio of coffee to water, which is very weak.  People tend to use a French Press when they want a full-bodied flavor.  If you try to extract a full-bodied flavor from that small amount of coffee, it will be very over-extracted, and you'll get to flavors that don't taste good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, a ratio of 1:16 would be closer to normal-strength coffee (it would equate to 14 g of coffee in your recipe); 1:14 would give you strong coffee.  I've seen recommendations as high as 1:12 for French Press.  At those ratios, you don't need to over-extract.  Get out the good-tasting stuff with a shorter brewing time, and leave the bad-tasting stuff in the grounds you throw away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extraction time is very long, which may mean that you're over-extracting.  If you start with the right ratio of coffee to water and the right grind, a total extraction time of 4-5 minutes should be about right.  Try this process as a starting point for timing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the 4-5 minutes (or the brewing time you figure out), just end the brewing and pour the coffee.  Don't worry about scooping out the sludge (try not doing it and see if you can taste a difference).  The sludge is the same coffee grounds, just a higher percentage of fines, and you'll get some of those in your cup, anyway.  If you give it a quick stir, most of it will fall to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just do the plunge very gently to minimize forcing fines up through the screen.  Some people don't plunge at all, they just leave the screen above the brew and pour through it.  From the time the brewing is done, you'll be adding maybe another half a minute of extraction getting the sludge to sink and plunging the screen.  This will give you a simpler process, with better control of the timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of water sounds like you're brewing a single serving, so I assume you're already pouring all of the coffee rather than letting some sit and continue to extract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other thing to try that may improve taste is a water temperature lower than what is typical.  With a coarse grind, people tend to use near-boiling water to help with the extraction.  If you switch to a slightly finer grind, you could try water well under 195F (try 195F, 185F, and 175F to see which gives you better flavor).  Lower temperatures will reduce the amount of harsh-tasting stuff extracted, so it will be a smaller portion of the flavor.  If the lower temperature water makes the extraction noticeably weaker, but the flavor is better, increase the extraction time a little to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  <title>Espresso dripping but yield &amp; pour time is right</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;everything seems right with my Breville Barista Max+ machine… the dose is 9g, grind size 18 and the output is 30g in 30s (inc. 7s of pre-infusion) pressure seems ok etc for a single shot. Tamp at 30lb of pressure etc, calibrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing is that doesn’t seem right is; when the pour starts, it’s a slow stream to begin but slows to a drip. Also the puck is very Wet, though I’ve seen a lot of posts saying not to worry about puckology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I worry about the dripping? Shot tastes good, slightly watery perhaps under a good level of cremer?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;For a single, presumeably with a double spout, dripping is normal. You'll only get a continuous stream when you pull a double. 30g out is actually pretty much from 9g in, a normal espresso would be 18g out.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why does my espresso come out more acidic than my French press coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I brewed some coffee in a French press and all I could really taste was the roast - slightly bitter and actually almost sweet. Not to my taste. I brewed the same coffee in an espresso machine and it came out very acidic, which I would actually prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing some googling, it seems like people are able to get acidic coffee out of a French press, so it doesn't seem to be an inherent difference between the two methods. Given that a coffee comes out more acidic in an espresso than in immersion coffee, can we conclude anything about the coffee itself? What kinds of coffee should I buy if I'd like to taste some acidity in an immersion brew?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are differences in acidity in different varieties of coffee, and you can choose a variety that is more acidic (more acidic coffees will often have their flavors described with terms that suggest brightness or fresh fruit).  Roasting also breaks down some of the acidic components, so the darker the roast, the less acidic it will be.  Try a light to medium roast for more acidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what you describe as related to brewing method probably isn't really tied to brewing method, but rather grind and extraction time.  The acidic flavors are the easiest to dissolve, so they are the first flavors extracted, regardless of brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With espresso, you use a very fine grind and extract for a very short time.  With French press, you use a coarse grind and extract for a long time.  Given any combination of grind and water temperature, the flavors extracted will vary over time.  The acidic flavors mostly extract relatively early.  Then flavors that give it sweetness and body.  The bitter flavors are the least soluable, so they are the ones extracted latest in the process.  You can also minimize bitter flavors with low water temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to recognize that the apparent flavor is affected by the balance of the different flavor components.  If you stop the extraction early, the acidic flavors will be over-represented.  As the brew progresses, other flavors become more noticeable, so the acidic flavors are less noticeable in comparison.  If the brew has plenty of body and flavor, and is noticeably acidic, that probably reflects the bean variety and roasting (or an excessive amount of coffee with a short extraction time).  If the taste is thin and empty but noticeably acidic, that points to it being under-extracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With espresso, time and temperature are controlled, and grind needs to be within a narrow range for the process to work.  With a French press, you can control all the variables.  If you want a more acidic result, start with lower temperature water (try 175°-185°F), and brew for a shorter time.  If the flavor is good but weak, use more coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, when running the machine without the coffee basket, water is trickling down very slowly - much more slowly than before. I also compared with videos I found online of the machine, so I know what to expect, more or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some research (including on this Stack channel) and realized the problem can be the &lt;a href="https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2508/espresso-drips-out-slowly"&gt;grind&lt;/a&gt;, descaling, &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/292861/Constant+Dripping+from+diffuser" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the valve spring&lt;/a&gt;, the pump or the temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using fine grind or more coarse grind does not make a difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Descaling did not help (I tried to descale a few times using both vinegar and that expensive descaler fluid Delonghi sell).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaning did not help. I cleaned every piece of this machine using descaler fluid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging this further, I found out that stretching the valve spring helps. When I do that, water seems to be flowing normally and the espresso comes out great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However - after I run the machine a few times, it goes back to not working properly: water is slowly dripping, and the espresso comes out flavorless. Stretching the spring again helps for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I doing wrong? Stretching the spring every week doesn't seem like a good solution to me. Could it be related to the pump, after all? I would appreciate any advice you may have.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why is using MSG to enhance the flavour of coffee so frowned upon?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Very small amounts of MSG significantly enhance the flavour of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may or may not like this enhancement (just as one may or may not like the addition of sugar), but that's not what I'm asking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike with the addition of vanillin or other artificial flavours, many people seem to react very badly to the &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; using MSG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the serious reasons for this negative attitude?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note that any answer that repeats the myth that MSG is bad for one's health will be downvoted.)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, there have been wild claims about various (or most) coffee packagers adding MSG to either their coffee or the packaging, supposedly to make their product more addicting or at least more popular.  People react negatively to such claims for many obvious reasons -- they've heard that MSG is harmful, they don't want adulterated coffee, they don't want to be duped or manipulated, etc. There has never been any actual evidence that any coffee packager actually did this, and lab tests disproved the claims when specific coffee companies were targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some retailers now put &amp;quot;No MSG&amp;quot; notices on their coffee offerings for the same BS marketing reasons they put &amp;quot;gluten free&amp;quot; on products that never contained gluten.  So to the extent people are aware of the disinformation campaigns or see the &amp;quot;No MSG&amp;quot; notices, they are likely to frown on it as someone adulterating their food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect the negative reaction to hearing that &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; do it is either the same generalized reaction (if it's bad for coffee packagers to do it, why would you do it yourself?), or the fact that it's an unusual substance to add to coffee.  For example, some people are aware that adding a small amount of salt to coffee can enhance the taste (if you like that); the people who aren't aware of it often consider it strange when they hear about it.  And adding MSG is far more unusual.  Some people are adventurous, and anxious to try new things.  Others cringe at the idea of things that sound unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have jumped to a conclusion that there must, or could, be a good reason not to add MSG to coffee based on the often negative reaction people have to the idea.  The negative attitude can be explained, but I'm not aware of factual or compelling supporting reasons not to do it (other than the person believing that small amounts of MSG are harmful).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Gasket in Rancilio "Miss" Silvia completely dried up and difficult to remove; is my machine totalled?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have a very old (probably 1990's) Rancilio &amp;quot;Miss&amp;quot; Salvia. It was given to me by my uncle and I never bothered to service it until now. I feel ashamed obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put descaler through it today. But then I got the itch and now it's upside down and being inspected for a possible change of gasket seal and shower plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After removing the &amp;quot;screen&amp;quot; or shower plate, I'm wondering exactly what I'm looking at. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/RUzjOuPIi2o?t=135" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This is a video of the Rancilio Silvia&lt;/a&gt; in a similar position to mine. I've removed the &amp;quot;little brass jet breaker&amp;quot; (as the man in the video calls it). But I'm unable to remove the &amp;quot;defuser&amp;quot; as he then does moments later. I believe they must have a newer model to me, as he seems to very easily take this &amp;quot;defuser&amp;quot;. Mine seems like it's actually part of the group head. For the purposes of continuing to my issue; let's assume that's the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of my group head:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y6zVW.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y6zVW.png" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is that the &amp;quot;gasket&amp;quot; that is supposed to act as a seal, seems completely hard and I'm trying to work out if I should just go ahead and dig it all out or whether what I'm currently digging into is actually part of the machine itself. It seems to me that I can just pick pieces of black, old gasket out if I try hard enough. But it doesn't all come out nicely like in the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A closer pic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IgSZH.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IgSZH.png" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose my question here is; should I just keep chipping away at the thing until it feels like I've got it all out; or should I stop and question whether the old &amp;quot;Miss&amp;quot; Silvia never had changeable gaskets - and I'm actually just ruining my machine by picking at it continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I will need to try and locate a new gasket and probably shower plate for the machine also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way the rubber has clearly become extremely hard - and perhaps I just need to bury the machine and begin the mourning process.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;That gasket is certainly meant to be removeable. Old rubber gaskets will get hard and brittle, and it's probably glued in by coffe residue. So go ahead and remove it by any means necessary, short of damaging the rest of the machine. The group head is made of brass, a relatively soft metal, so be careful not to nick it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replace it with a new one made of silicone, those are way better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: The following is only valid for machines after 2006:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diffuser plate should come of as well, but it will definitely be glued on by coffee residue. I need quite a bit of force on mine now and then. You can try to bathe it in coffee fat solvent like cafiza. Prepare a bath of hot water with some cafiza dissolved, soak your group head in it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This obviously requires that you are able to disassemble the group head from the machine. Maybe you can get away with filling the upside down group head with the cafiza solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backflushing the machine with the help of a blind filter may also help.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Easy To Clean New Machine</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I bought a Breville Barista Express machine about 3 years ago now, and I've been thinking about replacing it soon. I loved the quality and the cafe-style coffee, but I find the pieces of the machine difficult to clean.
Do you have any recommendations for high quality machines that are easy to clean?
Thanks in advance.
Yotam&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Firstly, cleaning would be a lot easier if you had a seperate grinder and a separate machine (which has the added benefit of being able to replace only one of both should something break). I found that the Barista Express has a lot of parts with a lot of grooves and holes which make cleaning a bit of a mess if there are grounds stuck everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your budget and your location you may have different options so it's difficult to recommend an exact model. Also your willingness - or lack thereof - to buy used machines or grinders would factor into the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a similar price range, I would recommend going with a used Lelit machine and a new grinder, like the Eureka Mignon. Gaggia and Rancilio also make machines in that entry level price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might want to check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HIGdYy5of4" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; about espresso machines for under 500£ (TL;DW don't buy the delonghi Dedica) or maybe even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1LUkfpTtu0" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; about getting a whole setup for under 250£.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How soon do coffee beans lose flavor</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I mostly brew my coffee using a cold brew method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I store my beans in an air tight container. But it is a bit of a hassle to open the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sOvLk.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sOvLk.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would the beans lose much flavor if they were exposed to the air?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use up the beans within 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of considerations, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens in absolute terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens relative to your own sense of taste and smell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nature and usage of the air tight container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavor loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two actions are the big contributors to coffee losing its flavor: loss of aromatics through evaporation and oxidation.  These happen quickly on the surface and take longer in the interior of the beans or grinds.  The finer the grind, the faster it loses flavor, both because there's more surface area and the interior is closer to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So coarse grind for cold brew will take longer to noticeably deteriorate than medium grind for drip coffee makers, and whole beans will take longer than coarse grind.  Grinding the beans shortly before you're ready to use them will preserve the most flavor and minimize off-tastes from oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal differences in taste and smell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's what happens to the coffee, but different people are more or less sensitive to it.  Connoisseurs may taste the difference in ground coffee that's been exposed to air for a number of hours.  People with cast iron palates who drink utility coffee may not notice the degradation until the coffee is very old.  People also start to lose some of their sense of taste and smell as they get older, and may be less sensitive to the difference in taste of old coffee.  So it isn't so much a question of how much the flavor has degraded in ways you would measure in a lab, its how much degradation does it take for you to notice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're serving coffee to guests and you're a connoisseur and they're utility coffee drinkers, the nuances that give you great pleasure may be totally lost on them.  If you're the one with a cast iron palate and your guests can appreciate good coffee, old coffee that tastes fine to you may leave your guests wondering how you get it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air tight containers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing the coffee in an air tight container may slow the degradation, but not all air tight containers or methods of using them will do so.  If the coffee is sealed in a close-fitting or vacuum evacuated, air tight container that stays sealed, it can last for a reasonably long time.  But if the container contains a lot of air space, and/or you regularly open it to dispense coffee, the fact that the container may be air tight doesn't buy you much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the container is a pouch with a one-way valve so you can squeeze out the air when you reseal it, it will last longer than a can or canister with a tight-fitting lid.  Every time you open the container, some of the aromatics escape, and you introduce air.  With a can or canister, that fresh air oxidizes the coffee during storage after you reseal the container.  If you have a vacuum canister that gets pumped out by a vacuum sealer, you minimize the oxidation but still lose some aromatics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage time recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storage times recommended by coffee packagers varies by the market audience for the coffee.  Specialty coffees whose market is discriminating drinkers are likely to carry a &amp;quot;best-by&amp;quot; date of around 6 months for the sealed package.  On mass-market coffee, that's typically pushed to more like a year.  But those recomendations are for the still-sealed container.  Once you open it, the shelf life is much shorter.  When you first open year-old coffee, you'll get the aroma that was trapped in the container, but the flavor will quickly degrade.  Ground coffee will taste stale to many people within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how long you can keep coffee without it losing flavor depends on how fresh it is.  Freshly roasted coffee needs to age a little if you get it directly from a roaster, but otherwise, the fresher it is, the longer it will last.  Start by buying coffee as close as possible to when it was roasted.  You can contact the coffee company and ask how many months the use-by date on the package is from the roasting date.  For the longest shelf life, try to buy coffee as much under 6 months old as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For relatively fresh whole beans stored in a vacuum canister after opening the retail package, I've seen recommendations that the average coffee drinker can taste the difference after 6-8 weeks.  Other recommendations say many people can taste the difference after 2-3 weeks.  If you leave the beans in a retail pouch with a one-way valve and keep the air squeezed out, I've seen recommendations of 2-3 weeks shelf life before the average coffee drinker will notice the difference.  For a non-air-tight container, the recommendations are even shorter.  And all of those time frames are shorter for ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do the recommendations apply to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if it is just you drinking it, go by what you can taste.  My wife opens a year-old, giant canister of mass-market ground coffee, and spends many months working her way through it.  By the time the canister is half full, the only aroma is of very stale coffee.  By the time she gets to the bottom of the canister, it smells like medicine.  But it tastes fine to her.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to keep sachet coffee fresh?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I got some sachet coffee from Turkey. They are instant. I want to keep it fresh once it has opened. How can I make sure that the coffee remains fresh after opening as sachet turn to unwrap while sitting in cupboard.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are instant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in instant coffee? There is nothing to keep fresh, this has never been fresh. Instant coffee is made by freeze-drying already brewed coffee. Any volatile compounds that could be in the coffee are long gone already before you open the sachet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it's simply pre-ground coffee then I'm afraid you're out of luck too, even if the coffee was fresh when ground and packed, the immense increase in surface area compared to whole bean coffee means that no matter what you do, after a few hours or after a few days at the very latest, your coffee will taste stale.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Coffee Breeding Companies</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I've poked around but couldn't find solid information. Is coffee improvement done in mostly the private or public sector? Are there gene edited coffee varieties for commerical?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It's an interesting topic.  Genetic modification seems not to be a commercially viable approach to creating new coffee varieties.  Of course it is reasonable to ask the question, but &lt;a href="https://www.ncausa.org/About-Coffee/GMO-Legislation" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here is a statement&lt;/a&gt; from the National Coffee Association, which says in part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there GMOs in my coffee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No, the NCA is not aware of any GMO coffee in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tabloid news site DailyMail.co.uk carried &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-10032543/Scientists-create-genetically-engineered-coffee.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; last year (Sept. 27, 2021) about a &amp;quot;first ever genetically-engineered coffee&amp;quot;, but the substance of the story concerns &amp;quot;coffee cells [produced] in a bioreactor through cellular agriculture,&amp;quot; not genetic modification per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more relevant story appeared in Jan. 2018 on &lt;a href="https://dailycoffeenews.com/2018/01/29/understanding-gmos-genetic-engineering-and-the-future-of-coffee/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Daily Coffee News&lt;/a&gt; by roast Magazine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there is widespread consumer opposition to genetically modified foods and beverages, the scientific community does not share that opposition. And in light of the dire outlook for the future of coffee cultivation in the coming decades, it seems clear we must understand and embrace research that includes genetic engineering as a potential tool in the fight to save coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though currently there is no genetically engineered coffee available for commercial production, Jason Long, CEO of Cafe Imports, says, “The anti-GMO thing was just a bully pulpit, basically trying to get it out there. To me, it was to bring up and highlight the labeling issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still the prospect seems to be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clouds_in_My_Coffee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Clouds in my Coffee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can I reuse grounds to make another espresso?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href="https://chefman.com/products/espresso-machine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this espresso/latte machine&lt;/a&gt;. How many times can I make a cup from the same espresso grounds?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The simple answer is &lt;strong&gt;one extraction per portafilter filling.&lt;/strong&gt;
So depending on whether you use the smaller one-shot or larger double-shot insert, you get one or two shots per button press &lt;em&gt;and after that, the grounds are considered spent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d try to leave the grounds and push the button again and again, you wouldn’t just get increasingly weaker brews, but you would notice a lot of unpleasant flavors, from excessive bitterness to sour notes. It may seem wasteful, but that’s how espresso works - you pretty much get the best of each load in one go and that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I know of a somewhat strange habit in a few Swiss households that will keep once-used Nespresso capsules (which can count as “a serving of espresso grounds”) and will use it once again for a purposely weak brew that goes into making „Kafi Fertig“ („finished coffee“), a concoction that gets spiked with a generous amount of „Träsch“ (a fruit brandy) and sugar. But that’s not a practical option for a spent coffee puck which can and probably will fall apart, not to mention the food safety issues if you tried to keep it for a while. I very much don’t recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>precise control over water re-mineralization</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying for, literally, decades, to get really good coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I roasted for several years, and for two cups during that time, I reached absolute nirvana with coffee that tasted so good it literally changed my life. However, it was so hit and miss, I essentially gave up on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm desperately trying to be sure I'm doing the most that I can to do everything right to attempt to arrive at that taste with what I hope anyway, is recently roasted beans, though trying to locate a source of those, from a roaster that is willing to divulge the age of the roast (I am in a rural area, there is no &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; roaster I can form a relationship with) is proving difficult. Anyone who knows of such a mail order roaster, I would love to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the basics, I am trying to get the water exactly right as per the SCAA recommendations. If I understand those correctly, it should be chemical free water, with a TDS level of around 150.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased an ISpring RO filter system, with a re-mineralization filter. It does it's job, though the TDS at the outlet turns out to be around 30-40 range. So, being an engineer, I assumed I could put 5 remineralization filters in series, and &amp;quot;of course&amp;quot; I'd end up with 5 * 30, or 150 TDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hah !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not even close, with five such filters it didn't increase the TDS at all. I can almost see why when I think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my question is: How can I get re-mineralization up to 150 TDS with my RO water filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I'm aware of packets of minerals you can buy to add to water. I'm really looking for a &amp;quot;machine&amp;quot; solution, i.e., totally hands off yet extremely precise every time, without any sort of intervention other than turning on a tap. If there's no other solution, maybe I could build an automated &amp;quot;doser&amp;quot; to dump minerals in as the system calls for water. Maybe such a thing already exists ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks all for your help, and patience reading my question.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the ideal temperature/cooldown time for coffee brewed in a Keurig K-mini?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There are no temperature settings on the Keurig K-mini, only ounches to brew. What is the best wait time for the freshly-brewed coffee to cool down before consuption?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Really, it's whatever you prefer. Of course you don't want to drink it so hot that you scald your mouth, so the high end is generally in the range of any other beverage that you drink hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But your perception of the flavors is affected by the temperature. If you've ever participated in a coffee tasting, you focus not only on the flavor profile, but how it changes as the coffee cools down. While it's still very hot, you perceive less of the flavor in general. As the temperature drops into a range where your taste buds work well, you'll perceive more full and nuanced flavor, and notice a change in the flavor profile as it gets cooler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you order coffee from a coffee shop, they don't wait until the temperature is at some optimum before giving it to you. If you don't chug it down but drink it over time as it cools, you'll get to experience a range of flavors. Depending on your coffee preferences, you can choose to experience the full range of flavors, or find a temperature you like best and drink it all close to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That applies no matter how you brew it (assuming it's hot).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Are there any electric Turkish Coffee Makers without a mostly plastic or Teflon coated boiling pot?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Is there an electric Turkish Coffee Maker that doesn't have a mostly plastic or Teflon-coated boiling pot? I don't have a conclusive answer, but I cannot find such a product on the US market. This is a surprising development to me, but baring additional information from others, it seems to be the surprising truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional context, the following is an example of a plastic-only pot (other than the heating element). &lt;a href="https://www.wayfair.com/kitchen-tabletop/pdp/saki-4-cup-automatic-turkish-coffee-pot-saki1050.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.wayfair.com/kitchen-tabletop/pdp/saki-4-cup-automatic-turkish-coffee-pot-saki1050.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a direct answer from the manufacturer on Amazon about the plastic pot. Also, here is a product specification chart from Wayfair.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I did find a Arzum Okka electric Turkish Coffee model that had no plastic in the pot, but I was informed directly by the company (via e-mail) that their steel pot is coated in Teflon.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>French press technique without timing or blooming</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm new to French press coffee and have been experimenting rather than following the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique I ended up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn't require an initial bloom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn't require any timing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works well with both fine and course grind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems to provide a good result in minimum time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows a smooth and easy press.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can the experts tell me what I'm doing wrong and why I shouldn't do it? (I'm not being sarcastic):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put 60g in the container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pour in 1L boiling water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the grinds float to the top, stir them down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat until very little floats back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stirring a few times ensures all the grounds are equally soaked.&lt;br /&gt;
Allowing the grounds to sink means that the plunger doesn't get clogged on the way down.&lt;br /&gt;
When the plunger goes down without requiring much pressure, you know all the grounds are saturated and it's ready.&lt;br /&gt;
Course grind naturally takes longer than fine grind, so the required difference in timing happens automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The key question is: do you like your coffee? Does it taste well to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few thoughts, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing the brew will help you to repeat the procedure and make your coffee more consistent. Depending on your taste, usually 3 - 5 minutes is recommended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The water should be slightly less than boiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;60g per 1l of water is on the high side. Again, tastes vary, so try what suits you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a French press works with all levels of grinding, the usual recommendation is to use medium to not-quite-coarse. Too fine may clog the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't skip the bloom: poor a small amount of hot water over the coffee grounds and let it sit for half a minute to release trapped gases. This can improve the flavor and aroma of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like your handling of the plunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember: it's your coffee, your taste, and you will be served well if you follow your intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>making coffee concentrate for short trip</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm going on a 4-night trip soon, visiting a person who is not into coffee.  Seems like the simplest thing to do is to brew up some coffee concentrate beforehand, and dilute it with hot water each morning.  I did this once before, for a two-night trip, and it worked fairly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm an Aeropress afficianado, so I'll brew the concentrate that way. But I'm wondering if 4 days is pushing it - will it lose flavor or gain off-flavors after that long ?   And, would it be a good idea to freeze the concentrate after I make it, to minimize deterioration while travelling (figure about 5 hours door-to-door) ?  I'd store it in a not-quite-full Nalgene bottle (the hard Lexan kind that doesn't leach nasty tastes), so hopefully freezing won't crack it.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;From your question I gather that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have access to boiling hot water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will carry an Aeropress with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If carrying beans and a small hand grinder (one that fits inside the Aeropress like some of Timemore's grinders for example) is not an option, how about carrying ground coffee? Maybe in a resealable bag inside the Aeropress? While it is true that ground coffee rapidly degasses due to its drastically increased surface area compared to whole coffee - brewing the coffee, letting it cool down, letting it sit over a few days, will definitely negatively impact its taste more. Even in the freezer the coffee will oxidise rapidly, leading to a bitter and flat taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would do is grind up the coffee you need for those days and then freshly brew an Aeropress each time you fancy a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I have misunderstood you and you do not plan on bringing your Aeropress. If that's the case, I'd still strongly recommend it, since it would probably use even less space than a fancy container or thermos and you'll be able to enjoy freshly brewed coffee with your favourite recipe instead of some sort of reheated and diluted concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What is the minimum amount of coffee that produces the maximum possible concentration?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;There are several posts about &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; ratios of coffee and water, but the answers are somewhat subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not asking about &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;best&amp;quot;, or ideal acidity or sourness, or other factor of quality; I'm asking about the maximum possible chemical concentration value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I use 1g of coffee and 1000g of water, the result will be extremely weak.&lt;br /&gt;
If I double the coffee, the result will be twice as strong.&lt;br /&gt;
If I triple the coffee, the result will be thrice as strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I keep increasing the amount of coffee, eventually it will reach a saturation point, beyond which the concentration will remain the same regardless of the amount of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I imagine this would be similar to the concentrate produced during the Swiss Water decaffeination process, though that involves green beans, not roasted and ground.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, what is the smallest ratio (by weight, not volume please) that will achieve that maximum concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In case it makes a difference, assume cold-brew for a sufficiently long time.)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;There isn't a maximum concentration you can reach through the coffee:water ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With drip or immersion brewing, the coffee grounds absorb and hold about 2 grams of water for every gram of coffee. If you brew with 1:2 coffee:water, all of your brew would remain trapped in the grounds if you rely on gravity for extraction. Slightly more water would yield some beverage. That would produce the maximum achievable concentration for the specific brewing parameters, but it would not be at chemical saturation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an espresso process, you can brew at 1:2, or even 1:1, and still get a substantial portion of the extraction out. This is about as concentrated an extraction as you can get. But even at this concentration, the component compounds are not close to saturation. If you let an espresso cool, none of the compounds will precipitate or crystallize out of solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, let's say that you could reach a saturation-level concentration with some hypothetical form of brewing. There would still be no maximum concentration by your definition of not caring about the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brewing parameters determine how much of each compound goes into solution (that's why you can use them to manipulate the flavor profile). Similarly, the concentration would limit the maximum amount of each compound going into solution. The components are each at different concentrations in the coffee beans, and have different saturation points. So as the brew concentration increased, its flavor profile would change, and you could use that to manipulate the taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would still have a substantial amount of each flavor component, but the ratios between the components would change. It wouldn't be much different than varieties of coffee beans having different flavor profiles because those compounds are present in different ratios.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Too bad. However, if the black stuff you see is just a layer of burned salt, or whatever, you should be able to scrap it off with some iron wool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible, on the other hand, that it's not really black, rather dark violet. It's the color that inox steel gets after prolonged heating. In that case, it's completely innocuous and you can leave it there.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>does adding powdered creamer or milk to coffee make the coffee more potent?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;chemically speaking, do the molecules of any powdered milk addition cause a reaction that would make the coffee more potent? (As in, do the molecules in powdered substance react with the water in the coffee?)&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;No. Powdered milk is just pasteurized milk that has been dehydrated. There are various processes used to dehydrate milk, and higher heat methods tend to change the molecular structure of the milk more significantly than lower heat methods. However, neither any compound found in milk nor any compound produced by any method of pasteurizing milk can react chemically with  either water or any compound of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milk itself is an emulsion of liquid fat molecules and dairy proteins in water. Adding dehydrated milk--aka powdered milk--to water and mixing vigorously simply recreates the emulsion. The dehydration process used to turn the milk into a powder may produce some compounds which cannot form a colloid in water and may sink. But there are no chemical reactions. Just a good ol' fashioned mixup.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Moka pot question... brewing steps</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I needed to find a place where I could ask this question and get a knowledgable range of replies. Since stackexchange has been so useful in the past and I just discovered this Coffee Stackexchange, I'm asking here. I'm  more looking to see whether the responses here are equivalent to those found by searching online although in the case of this question, the range of answers is enough to drive you bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a 12-cup bialetti. We have always drunk Moka pot coffee in our home as essentially a way to make a caffe lungo, not for making espresso. It gives my wife and I two cups each brew. I think we've always been doing this right but because one can always learn, &lt;strong&gt;what do people here think is the method for brewing coffee in a Moka pot?&lt;/strong&gt; Water temperature, grind size, time of the brew, etc etc. One thing for example is that we don't fill the filter basket. It just gives us the strength we like that way, but is it harming our coffee extraction to do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water temperature:&lt;/strong&gt;
I like to boil some water in a tea pot or something then add the water to the Moka pot. Starting with cold water takes time to heat it up, and this heating process will cause your coffee to have more bitter and acidic tastes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;grind size:&lt;/strong&gt;
Kinda depends on what you want. If you use finer grinds, the coffee taste stronger. However, as you pointed out, Moka pot can't be used to make espresso. So if you use fine grinds for an espresso machine, the coffee will turn out to be unpleasantly strong! A grind size between espresso and french press is good. Sorry if this is not helpful...... If you live in the US, the default grind you can find in any grocery store is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;time of the brew:&lt;/strong&gt;
Related to water temp. Start with boiled water, brew until coffee stops going. Of course no need to open the lid and watch - it's time when you see steam coming out the top of the pot. Once you see that, remove it from the stove right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I always fill the basket. If you feel it's too strong that way, thy rougher grinds. If you don't fill it, I can imagine the coffee will be moving around when hot steam goes through, and that affects extraction. Filling the basket full makes sure they stay as a nice layer all the way through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your coffee!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can I upgrade a 54mm portafilter machine to 58mm?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I think this is likely a dumb question but I have a Breville Barista Pro which has a 54mm portafilter.  It seems like all the cool coffee tools come for 58mm portafilters so I was wondering if it was possible to &amp;quot;upgrade&amp;quot; (buy a new one) my 54mm portafilter to a 58mm one for the same machine?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is not only with the portafilter, but with the group head that receives the portafilter.
There are several reasons why it is (practically) impossible to do that.
In budget friendly machines such as the the Breville Barista Pro, the brew head is usually some sort of proprietary design of the manufacturer - as opposed to e.g. the Faema E61 brew head who is found on many enthusiast machines.
This makes it practically impossible to find drop-in replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if there were replacements, they would usually cost a lot and be very hard to replace, requiring a lot of technical knowledge about how the machine is constructed, not to mention the time required to complete the replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for some sort of adapter which enables you to use your 58mm accessories on a 54mm brew head, I must disappoint you as well, I have never heard or seen anything of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal suggestion, should you really be bummed out about the lack of available accessories and really really want to use all the &amp;quot;cool coffee tools&amp;quot;, would be to sell your current machine and save money for one with a standard size 58mm brew head. But these machines, especially ones with the aforementioned E61 brew head, start in the ballpark of 1-2 thousand dollars/euros, so that is a decision only you can make.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>French Press Technique, two basic questions</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have been following James Hoffmann french press technique &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. But am otherwise new to coffee-making in general and have two basic questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it necessary to stir after the four minutes as he says? I have heard some say that in certain situations it is actually inadvisable to do this, if so what are these situations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it unnecessary to plunge? He says not to plunge through the coffee—what effect does partial/full plunging have (on the pouring of the coffee)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether to stir or not to stir is entirely a matter of personal opinion. Stirring will create the effect of superior extraction, as not stirring will saturate the water around the grounds before stirring is complete. However this can lead to &lt;em&gt;overextraction&lt;/em&gt; if your grind is too fine or if your brew runs too long or too hot. The effect of greater extraction may also be undesirable with certain batches of beans. And lastly, there's positively no accounting for taste. Don't feel bad about doing it the way you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plunging or not shouldn't make any difference at all unless you're compressing the grounds when you plunge. If you plunge with enough force to compact the grounds, you can cause the release of compounds from the coffee that are undesirable in terms of taste. The effect here is similar to overextraction due to too long brew time. Generally I advise plumbing just to make the pour easier, but a halfway plunge is plenty sufficient. Don't squeeze the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  <title>relationship of grind size to immersion time - aeropress</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;when brewing, does more time with a coarser grind give the same flavour as less time with a finer grind? ie for a given flavour is it a simple proportional relationship of surface area to time, with some constant?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;No, when brewing via submersion, coarser grinds brewed longer will not produce the same flavors as fine grinds brewed shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why is penetration time. Water takes longer to infiltrate coarse grounds due to the power surface area vs fine grinds and the equal density. Because it takes longer, compounds extracted at the beginning of the brew sit in the hot water longer, and more undesirable compounds are extracted from the exteriors of the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually the reason why finer grinds are preferred for Aeropress brewing. The water can quickly extract the flavors from most of the grounds with fine grinds, and the harsh, bitter flavors that are typical of other submersion methods (looking at you, French press) are avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm investigating reusable metal filters for drip coffee makers or pour-over, and the information online seems counter-intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online discussion about the difference always describes how the metal filters have bigger pores than paper filters, so you get more sediment and oils in the coffee with metal filters. But the discussions leave out the obvious question of how the pore size difference affects extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a big range of pore sizes in metal filters (20-800 microns vs. 10-20 microns for paper), so there must be a lot of variation in their effect. But if sediment is getting through a metal filter, the larger pores would allow water to flow through more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that for drip coffee makers or pour-over, the grinds are in contact with the water for a shorter time, which would result in less extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less extraction should result in a &amp;quot;brighter&amp;quot; (more acidic) flavor profile, and fruity and sweet flavors less masked, maybe even weaker flavor. However, the discussions conflate the &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; contributed by the fines and oils (and maybe the flavors of those), and claim that it's paper filters, instead, which yield a flavor profile associated with lower extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question:&lt;/strong&gt; Compared to paper filters, do metal filters have an appreciable effect on extraction time (and extraction level), when used with drip coffee makers or pour-over?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Seeking Advice on Importing Roasted Specialty Coffee Beans from Brazil into the US: Permitting and Legal Requirements</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm a Brazilian currently residing in the United States, and I'm exploring the idea of importing specialty coffee beans roasted in my hometown in Brazil to sell here in the US market. My hometown is renowned for producing unique and high-quality coffee, and I believe there's a niche market for it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I'm encountering challenges navigating the complex process of permits and legal requirements associated with importing roasted goods into the US. Despite conducting some initial research, I still feel overwhelmed and unsure about the necessary steps to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've come across suggestions to hire a customs broker to assist with the process, but the associated costs seem prohibitive, especially for someone like me who is at the initial stages of starting a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I'm reaching out for insights and advice. Do you have any experience or expertise in importing goods into the US, particularly in the realm of specialty food products such as roasted coffee beans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would greatly appreciate any guidance, tips, or resources you can offer to help me navigate this journey more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance for your assistance and support!&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This isn't an answer to what you asked, but perhaps an alternate approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the beans unique is the beans, themselves. The roasting process can be replicated anywhere (by someone with the equipment and skill, which can be replicated anywhere).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If stored properly, the raw beans will last a very long time without degradation. But once they're roasted, they have a very short shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what's legally required to import raw beans, and how that would be different from importing roasted goods. But some considerations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw beans could be shipped in bulk by comparatively inexpensive methods (boat), and be used up over a long time. Roasted beans would need fast transportation (air), in small enough quantities to be used up soon after arrival. This would add significant costs that would put you at a competitive disadvantage for business purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any form of import will require inspection on arrival by Customs. This would not affect raw beans. Roasted beans would need to be kept in sealed containers until use. Opening any container for inspection would ruin all the coffee in the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importing raw beans might leave you with similar kinds of regulatory questions to answer. But at least that might put you on a better track as a business idea, and the information might be easier to track down.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Can I speed up the laxative effect of coffee (maximum in 30-45 minutes)?</title>
  <body>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hi everyone, I have a hydrogen-sulfur type SIBO disease and If I
don't defecate everyday, the poop accumulates in the bowels and make
me pass gas (believe me it has really foul smell like rotten egg). I
everyday defecate through the laxative effects of the granular
coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I put 3 teaspoon granular coffee, 3 cube sugar in every mug that I
drink, and I drink 3 mug of coffee in total. If I don't add sugar in
the coffee or I don't smoke cigaretts(it's too harmfull please don't
smoke) with coffee or the coffee is cold, then the laxative effect of
the coffee decrease too much(atleast for me).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And my main problem is that I drink that much coffee to defecate but
it takes 2 hours of mine. As an unemployed person, 2 hours is nothing
for me but because I'll be in working life soon and 2 hours'll have
a worth as gold for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; How can I decrease the time that I need for the coffee's laxative effect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I tried for it:&lt;/strong&gt; I drank hot water instead of coffee(I drank 6-7 mug of water for the same effect) but it took same amount time. I think to decrease the amount of water in the mug and increase the amount of coffee but I don't know if it works.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It'd be best to ask your gastroenterologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have IBS, not SIBO, so the following might not be right for you, but my gastroenterologist recommended daily prebiotic fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mix Bulletproof InnerFuel Prebiotic fiber supplement into coffee or a smoothie. The company recommends starting small and building up to ?2 scoops, but I've settled on less than 1 scoop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many types of fiber, and people respond differently to them, so plan on experimenting with types and amounts.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Baratza Sette 270 (not Wi) poor man's grind-by-weight</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I currently own a Breville Infuser espresso machine and the Smart Grinder Pro, but I'm looking to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my eyes on the Baratza Sette 270 line, and ideally I would go for the grind-by-weight 270Wi, but it's a bit out of my price range (currently $200 more expensive than the regular grind-by-time 270).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently it's possible to simulate the grind-by-weight feature of the 270Wi in the regular 270 by keeping the hopper fully empty, weighting the exact amount of beans for a single dose and then dumping that into the hopper. I know it's a bit more work, but if there are no other drawbacks, I am more than willing to do it for the $200 savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions: would that really work? Is the result worse, similar or better than the 270Wi's grind-by-weight feature? Are there any drawbacks to this? I'm worried the grinder is designed to work with a minimum amount of beans in the hopper and might have issues (whether grinding quality, or even mechanical issues that might shorten the grinder's lifespan) when working with just a single dose's worth of beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional question: would the 54mm portafilter of the Breville Infuser machine fit into the holder in the Sette 270, or do I need to grind into a pot and then dump it into the portafilter?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Dumping by tipping the machine and using gravity won't work perfectly because some grinds stick inside the machine due to static buildup and the fact that those tiny pieces are very lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I highly recommend the Eureka Silenzio. This grinder has a much narrower connection point from the hopper to the grinder, and you can remove the hopper and fit a bulb blower over that pipe very nicely. There are some kits you can buy to do this by searching &amp;quot;Eureka Mignon Hack&amp;quot; or by finding some kind of product with an attached blower you can cut off. You can fit a piece of PVC pipe into the connection point where the hopper would normally go to create a single or double dosing tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add beans the PVC pipe, where gravity pulls them into the grinder. Flip your blower bulb upside down so it blocks beans from bouncing out. Grind into your portafilter. When done, knock the porta filter gently on the countertop to settle the grounds, then put it back under the grinder, flip your blower bulb back over and fit it over the PVC pipe, and blow. The blower will push out the grounds that stuck, and you will see here how big a mistake relying on gravity is. It's a good bit of coffee!&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have an Eureka Mignon Perfetto and I really hate its &amp;quot;easy setting&amp;quot; dial: it's too sensitive and it makes any precise adjustment impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to remove it from the threaded adjustment rod and exchange it for the standard dial that the Silenzio or Specialita' use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of searching around, I found out that there is a removable plastic cap on top of the dial.
Once open it reveals the adjustment gears: a metal traveler that seems to be screwed to the threaded rod, actuated by the outside, rotating, plastic dial.
I tried to unscrew this metal part but it doesn't seem to loosen and I don't want to break anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: as per title, has anyone ever managed to remove this abomination of a knob from a Perfetto and replace it with the standard knob from the Silenzio/Specialita'?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What affects coffee quality?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;When I go to a coffee shop, I see many different coffees. There are these cheap powdered coffees that don't taste too good, ground coffee, and whole coffee beans. On the internet or in specialty shops, you can find even more types of coffee. What could help me judge coffee quality? For example, I know that with tea the rule of thumb is that bigger, looser leaves are of better quality. Moreover, the first harvest is the most precious one. Do similar rules apply to coffee? What are other general rules that signify better coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly general question, so pardon me for a slightly generic answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing you'll want to consider is the quality of the coffee itself.  Typically, the more expensive a coffee is, the higher quality it will be.  It's the age old phrase, 'You get what you pay for".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the less steps from it being picked to it being in your cup, the better.  Packaged, ground coffee has more steps (Packaging, grinding) before being brewed.  Whole bean coffee has less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the longer it's been ground, the longer it has had to degrade.  You'll want to grind your whole-bean coffee as close to the time of brew as possible.  Oxygen will erode the flavor of the coffee over time.  Ground coffee has more surface area to be exposed to oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this addresses what you were asking properly.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>What are substitutes of caffeine?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Are there any substitutes of caffeine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of similar effects such as energy, alertness, decreased fatigue, increased metabolic rate, etc.?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;While you may not find many perfect substitutes for caffeine which will give you all of the same effects, there are things you can do which will decrease your need for caffeine.  A quick search reveals a few things you can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat Apples and other fruits - Calories, high fructose levels, vitamins,
and antioxidants they provide are all important for sustaining energy levels
throughout the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain your &lt;a href="http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/prevention-wellness/food-nutrition/nutrients/vitamin-b-12.printerview.all.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; level - Decreased levels of Vitamin&lt;br&gt;
B-12 - found in fish, shellfish, meat, and dairy products - can cause
fatigue and weakness.  It plays a key role in mental clarity and&lt;br&gt;
energy enhancement which is why its included in many energy drinks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise - Many studies have shown that exercising in the morning can
give you more of an energy boost than caffeine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a good nights sleep - well, obviously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess you could sum this answer up with saying a balanced diet, exercise, and a healthy sleep cycle all are necessary for you to sustain your energy levels throughout the day, remain alert, and increase your metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When life happens and you can't get a good nights sleep, healthy breakfast, exercise, etc... stick with Caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How can I repair a leaking drip coffee brewer?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;My drip coffee brewer's container has been cracked and it is leaking. I know super glue is toxic. How can I repair it?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Just get a replacement. Given reality, unless it's some super special-to-you drip brewer, get a whole replacement coffee maker, which will set you back very little at all at a thrift store, and not much more brand-new. Finding the exact replacement for a particular carafe is much more difficult, and often, in the odd way things are, more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you simply HAVE to repair it, well, either go visit a glassblower, or become one (assuming a glass carafe - replace "glassblower" with "weldor" if a stainless steel carafe that you've somehow managed to crack.) That will undoubtely cost a great deal more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've personally moved away from automatic drip, but things are no different in French press - if you break the glass, the whole thing costs less than getting a replacement for just the glass. So far I've managed "careful" pretty well (mine is is probably older than I am,) but I know a fair number of folks who've gone to a stainless steel French press after dropping a couple of glass ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is my coffee the HOTTEST immediately after the brewing cycle is done or sitting on the burner/plate for awhile? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m wondering by me letting the completed cycle sit for 15 minutes or so before pourers a cup am I cooling the coffee down or helping it to get hotter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you 
Mary&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I suppose this depends on your machine, but it is easily tested. The water should be hottest while dripping, but while it passes the filter, it'll cool down, so at what temperature it lands in the pot can only be measured, or tasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of temperature, letting coffee sit after brewing is never recommended since it changes flavor (and not for the better).&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Decreased blood acidity</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;How can blood acidity be prevented by eating coffee and its acidity level balanced to alkaline ?
Of course, except for drinking a lot of water.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Our blood ph level drives our respiratory rate, if we are not breathing out enough CO2 we build up carbonic acid which in turn drives our respiratory rate higher until such time we have reduced our PH levels to a 'normal' range which is around 7.35 to 7.45 Ph.
 Simply put it's not possible to alter blood acidity or alkalinity without making yourself sick and usually ending up in an ICU.
The human body (and other species) uses a process called homeostasis which is our autopilot of systems integration to keep us alive and relatively healthy. Illness and chronic disease can impact on our bodies ability to balance itself but it will do it's best to keep its chemistry balanced.
There are a number of cases (Illness) where php drops (acidity) and the body moves other chemicals around to balance this which can have a knock on effect throwing other systems out (I.e. cardiac arrhythmias due to sodium/ potassium  / calcium imbalances etc.). There are other cases where calcium.is scavenged from our skeletal system (which can cause early onset osteoporosis, and a cohort of other nasties.&lt;/p&gt;

  <body>&lt;p&gt;I always had loved drinking coffee like this: a full hot cup of milk and a teaspoon of coffee (instant coffee) and teaspoon of brown sugar. Some one told me it’s not healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love latte but not without sugar free synfuel and that too is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it true that the way I have coffee is bad? I have like 2 or sometimes 3 cups a day.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I'm no nutritionist, biologist, biochemist, or doctor. But I can tell you what Ive heard and learned over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee itself isn't inherently bad for you. Some science suggests its good for you in fact.  The problem is in how we choose to prepare it for drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar and cream... both up for debate I think. Sugar is an essential component to life. Milk isn't bad for you either, necessarily.  Like anything else though, moderation is key.  Milk does contain fats and sugars.  So if you're watching your intake of these things for health sake, then milk contributes its own parts.  Aside from that, unless you're lactose intolerant, milk is a-okay to consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like lattes too but you need to use espresso for that.  Your instant coffee version doesn't sound particularly appetizing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that whenever I use straight milk in regular coffee, I don't know if its the heat or the acids of the coffee working on the milk, but I get this sour taste after twenty minutes or so. I don't get that flavor with other creamers, even dairy-based creamers. I've started using those flavored Carnation-brand creamers because of it. Oddly, I also don't get that sour flavor when I use straight milk and espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Would method of ingesting coffee affect its effectiveness in terms of caffeine extraction to the body?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I have some instant coffee powder packs that include coffee, milk, and sugar in a single packet.
Lately, due to circumstances related to limited time and availability of electricity, I've been ingesting them by gradually swallowing the powder after dissolving it in my mouth with saliva (a bit at a time), and then later drinking some cold water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the body extracting the caffeine from this powder, is there a way to know if this means of ingestion is more efficient/effective than the normal means (i.e.: mixing powder with boiled water and then drinking)?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I don't have cited sources, but from experience (the next best thing), it seems that ingesting the instant coffee powder and then drinking water later was about as effective as mixing the powder with hot water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it was found that breathing a steady supply of fresh air also increases the effectiveness of the caffeine extraction since oxygen boosts the body's metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Is coffee with milk a health risk?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Recently a friend of mine told me that caffeine together with milk can create some carcinogenic compound. I haven't heard about it so far, neither found an article about it on google. Is there any possibility that this is true?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Milk doesn't affect caffeine effects.
Adding milk can affect the time in which your body absorbs caffeine, it is extended, but you won't probably feel this.
In 1997, scientists discovered that your nervous system won't be as stimulated (compared to drinking dark coffee) when you'll drink coffee with milk, but there won't be much of a difference in the concentration of caffeine in your blood.
There's no confirmation that milk reacts with caffeine and affects it in any way, but there's a thing with which milk does interact. It's called CGA, chlorogenic acid, a highly active polyphenol with glycolytic and insulin-sensitizing properties and, of course, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
Adding milk to coffee can lower the bioavailability of chlorogenic acid and other polyphenols by binding them to milk proteins, especially beta-lactoglobulin.
You won't feel the difference so much, you'd have to look at numbers on your blood test to tell that there's something different apart from the taste of the coffee.
Nothing's gonna be a problem unless you don't have moderation on how much you drink it.&lt;/p&gt;

I've read online use non fat, full fat, and everything in between.  Does anyone recognize the texture I'm looking for?  How can I achieve it?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Capsules and caffeine: How many Nespresso capsules are too many for a days? Is caffeine content different in different types of capsule?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;And the last question here: is there a big difference between squeezing a capsule once and twice concerning caffeine content?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;How many are too many for a day depends on which you're using. As you suspect, different pods might have different levels of caffeine. Darker roasts tend to have less caffeine, while lighter roasts and flavored coffees likely have more caffeine. From what I can tell, it looks like Nespresso pods ought to vary between 50 and 150 milligrams per pod with the majority of varieties in the 70-80mg range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding caffeine consumption, please understand that we are not doctors and cannot provide medical advice. Everyone is affected differently by caffeine. If you're looking for your own limit, start at 2 Nespresso brews per day (140-200mg) and work from there. Also, coffee itself isn't generally harmful to people, though sweeteners, including milk (lower fat milks tend to be higher in sugar), can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, regarding caffeine extraction, the answer depends on some variables. Coffee grind size, water temperature, brew time, brew method, and amount of caffeine in the coffee all affect this. For the Nespresso, which uses pressure to draw a relatively short extraction somewhat like an espresso machine, the first brew probably extracts about 60% of the caffeine, while a second brew of a once-used pod might get you 80%. This is just a guesstimate based on what I know about espresso brewing.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Sumatra or Espresso More Acidic?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I am looking for a less acidic caffeinated drink. Currently Sumatra is the least acidic coffee I’ve found but was wondering if espresso is better since it’s less liquid and has the same amount/more caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;The acidity level of brewed coffee is mainly influenced by three factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darkness of roast, with lighter roasts generally resulting in higher concentrations of acidic compounds and darker roasts resulting in lower concentrations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grind size, with finer grinds enabling greater extraction of acidic compounds (due to greater exposed surface area) and coarser grinds preventing extraction of acidic compounds retained inside the grinds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duration of brewing method, with shorter duration brewing methods like espresso generally producing a more acidic brew than longer duration brewing methods like drip or French press&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in general, if you want the least acidic brew you can get, opt for either drip or French press with a dark roast. French press will generally produce a less acidic cup than drip with the same batch of roasted coffee because the grind size difference is quite large.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Does turkish coffee require different beans or roast or grind than espresso?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;After a while I settled on the beans that for filtered coffee, and I like espresso with them too, just ground more finely. So now I tried Turkish coffee with the same beans and the same grind as espresso, and, well, it doesn't seem to taste as well as I expected. Sort of more oily than espresso. What would be the prime thing to try change? Any special beans required for optimal taste?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I believe many people simply boil the grounds in their earlier attempts. This approach is known not to be a good practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience, I could say the most notable changes that you could note in Turkish coffee is twofold: it should be fresh and quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freshness is important as the grounds are as fine as flour. So, they stale very quickly. One of the reasons that people have traditional hand grinders is this. Ground just before you prepare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick preparation is important to be able to extract more before the all the flavor has been evaporated. That's why you need a pretty good cezve with a decent stove to transfer heat as quickly as possible. It is said that whole preparation must take under two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OF course there are many details regarding any kind of coffee preparation. I believe these two could be the first things to change. Unfortunately, Turkish coffee preparation requires serious experience and the learning curve is steep. You could fine tune many parameters after gaining some more experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For similar discussion that may include a hint please see:&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Frenchpress doesn't extract coffee enough</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;I'm going around three cups of coffee powder for one cup of coffee. My frenchpress has a capacity of 1 liter, when I cook about 500 ml coffee at a time, it seems so the coffee which is higher up the french press is much weaker than which is at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brew at the moment for 5 minutes and have attempted agitating the beans in the beginning by mixing with a spoon. Also I use a coarse grind.&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Try weighing your coffee and start with 60g per litre, so 30g of ground coffee for 500ml. Grind medium to medium fine to increase the surface area and thereby the extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he was absolutely fantastic, several guests have praised the good coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a web search I found no official website of this coffee manufacturer and would like to learn more why they are so good. Can anyone give factual reasons why this coffee tastes so good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there similar beans, possibly a little cheaper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could be the magic behind these beans?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;I can't answer about that specific bag of magic beans but I can offer tips for finding coffee beans you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tips on what to look for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roasters who roast in small batches, taking the time to filter out defects from the raw beans and adjust the roasting time for each batch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roasters who source great beans, esp. single source beans from identified farms. Those are likely to be available only seasonally and in modest quantities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bags of beans that are labelled with the roast date or at least a &amp;quot;best by&amp;quot; date that's predictably 2-3 months after roast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online stores of these small roasters, or retail outlets like small coffee shops and farmers' markets where you can taste coffee samples or buy a cup before buying a bag of beans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(All this is the opposite of large roasters and grocery stores who prioritize cost. They blend cheaper beans from various sources then roast, warehouse, and ship in bulk. AIUI, grocery stores generally don't treat coffee like fresh food.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now watch James Hoffmann's guide to buying great coffee. He covers freshness, whole vs. pre-ground beans, traceable coffee sources as a quality clue, seasonality, places to buy coffee, roast levels, and decoding tasting notes:

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Is this the inside of the moka pot? If so, toss it and buy a new one &lt;strong&gt;immediately&lt;/strong&gt;. What you can see is probably old, burnt and rancid coffee. In the worst case there might even be some rust there but I can't really tell from this picture. This looks like it hasn't been cleaned properly ever. Make sure to rinse your new moka pot really well after each use and also clean it with dish soap or other cleaning agents regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How to reduce acidity in coffee?</title>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;The coffee I've been making at  french press home feels to acidic and upsets my stomach. However when I go drink cafe coffee, even if its stronger it feels less acidic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could I be doing wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;In a broad sense, the roast of the coffee has a significant impact on the acidity of the coffee. Check the type of coffee beans you're using. Are they &amp;quot;dark roast&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;medium roast&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;light roast&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark roast has the least acidic nature, in contrast to light roast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from this, size of coffee beans after grinding. If the size is coarse, acidity increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other multiple factors, but these are the most common ones. Also, assuming by &amp;quot;cafe coffee&amp;quot; you mean non-specialty coffee, the lack of acidity is due to the instant nature of it, that uses dark roast, and extreme fine grains to reduce acidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the environment where the coffee beans are from also affect the acidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rinse normal paper filter, in standard position.&lt;br /&gt;
40g of blooming water for 25 seconds, stir 5 times.&lt;br /&gt;
Add 210g of water, stir once.&lt;br /&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;It depends on the culture at your office. I work with other developers and coffee is considered to be an essential work tool equal in importance to computers and chairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having three "packets" of espresso at one time, or over 10 minutes, would not be noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;This can happen if the gasket around the group head is damaged or worn out. Damage can occur if you overtighten the portafilter when locking it in place to brew, and wear occurs just by using the machine normally. Under normal use (once daily at least five days a week), a group head gasket will need to be replaced about every six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this would vary from individual to individual, depending on health, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I thought I'd ask this basic question on this format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per comment:
Here, &amp;quot;too much&amp;quot; == likely to harm one if done on a daily basis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here coffee == brewed ground black coffee which I consider the 'standard' variant...&lt;/p&gt;
</body>
  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own tolerance level for everything. None are the same.
In my case, if I, for some reason, drink 4 mugs of coffee in a single specific day, I kind of feel lightheaded and find myself unable to get some sleep until 6 am in the morning. So, I think my tolerance limit is 4 mugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is up to you to find your own tolerance, but I think that it is not advisable to drink more than 3 mugs a day if you are like me.&lt;/p&gt;

  <mostVotedAnswer>&lt;p&gt;What you have to keep in mind is that what might taste awful to you doesn't &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; taste bad to someone else. Some people (myself included) really enjoy the bitter tastes and nodes while others, (such as yourself) find the flavors overpowering.
