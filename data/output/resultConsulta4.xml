Lately it's been having a lot of trouble pushing the water through the coffee.  We can hear the pump pumping, but the water just barely drips out.  We end up having to pull it 2 or 3 times to get a full shot (or just wait for the drips to fill up the shot glass).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I opened up this machine once before in the hopes of cleaning it, but found almost everything inside pretty clean and the plumbing is all sealed up.  So I'm a little befuddled as to what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do I fix my machine so that the shots come out in a single pull?  I wonder if my pump just can form enough pressure anymore - can I measure the pressure?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A note on the grounds:  We have the grinder set to the finest grind, which comes out like a fine sand.  We've had it this way for a long time and not had any problems.  We fill the basket to about 1/2 full (it's a double shot basket, and we only need one shot - the single shot basket was fed to the garbage disposal years ago) and tamp.  I've been tamping more lightly recently, thinking that the problem was grounds that are too compressed to let the water through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2069" LastActivityDate="2022-03-09T08:21:50.693" Title="Espresso drips out slowly" Tags="&lt;espresso-machine&gt;" AnswerCount="12" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0"/>

There are two different ways to&#xA;  make it. The first, and the one I prefer, is to add a small amount of&#xA;  hot water to a double or quadruple Espresso Ristretto. Like adding a&#xA;  splash of water to whiskey, the small dilution releases more of the&#xA;  complex flavours in the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“The second way is to pull an extra long double shot of Espresso. This&#xA;  achieves approximately the same ratio of oils to water as the dilution&#xA;  method, but also releases a different mix of flavours due to the&#xA;  longer extraction. Some complain that the long pull is more bitter and&#xA;  detracts from the best character of the coffee, others feel it&#xA;  releases even more complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“The important thing is that neither method of preparation should use&#xA;  so much water as to result in a sickly, pale ghost of Espresso.&#xA;  Moderation in all things.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3795" LastEditorUserId="3813" LastEditDate="2017-02-02T16:38:14.497" LastActivityDate="2018-03-02T20:08:09.617" Title="What is a café allongé, and how is it pronounced?"

I bought a bag of coffee grounds and a coffee dripper online. The dripper is a stainless steel type with a couple fine mesh filters in it, which lets me do pour overs without a paper filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's my method: I'm putting 3 tablespoons of grounds into my dripper, and then with a kettle of 17oz, just off the boiling water, begin pouring over my grounds with enough water to fill the dripper half full. I wait 10 seconds while the grounds bloom and then I fill the dripper to the top and wait for the coffee to brew. Then, when the dripper gets about half empty, I fill it back up with water. I intend to end with ~16oz of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My problem is that the grounds end up plugging up my dripper and the drip process ends up taking forever. By the time all the water has passed through my coffee grounds and dripper the coffee is COLD!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What am I doing wrong? Am I trying to get too much coffee out of the pour-over method? Is it really only meant for a single cup serving? Like 6oz and 1 tablespoon of grounds?

The espresso machine comes with two types of filters (for singles and doubles), and can dispense a pre-programmed volume of water corresponding to a single or double dose through its two front buttons (the machine also allows programming these volumes, if desired.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus there are 4 combinations of coffee I could produce:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Using a single filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a single dose (~30 ml, as I understand).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Using a double filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a single dose.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Using a single filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a double dose (~60 ml, as I understand).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Using a double filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a double dose.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are any of these 4 cases not usual or &quot;recommended&quot;? Particularly I never brew the combination corresponding to case 3.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is the expected flavor profile of the espresso produced in each of these cases (more/less acid, sour, sweet, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which of these could be called a ristretto, normale, or lungo?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What parameters should I aim for in each of these cases, in terms of: mass of grounds in the filter before brewing (in g), shot volume (in ml) or mass (in g) in the cup, and extraction time (in s)? I have heard extraction times should be always 25 s regardless of the coffee dose and the volume of water, so 25 s for all combinations above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This machine has a pressure gauge, indicating water pressure during extraction. Should I watch for a particular value in this gauge, or ignore it and just watch the extraction time? Currently my procedure for adjusting the grind is to make it coarser when pressure is in the upper 2/3rds of the gauge range, and finer when pressure is in the lower 1/3rd of the gauge range. I do not regularly monitor extraction time for adjusting the grind. Using combination 4, and adjusting the grind such that the pressure gauge stays close to the midpoint, extraction times are in the range of 25-30 s. However, using the same grind settings but dosing enough water for a single (combination 2), extraction times are closer to 15 s. To get closer to 25 s I would have to let the pressure gauge reach values way into the upper range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In closing: although I enjoy the taste of combination 2, it appears most of the water stays in the coffee puck, and the volume actually dispensed in the cup is very small (about 15-20 ml). Perhaps I should reprogram the water volume to get something closer to, say, 30 ml? Would this help me get an extraction time closer to 25 s for this dose (assuming this is the &quot;ideal&quot; extraction time)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="96" LastEditorUserId="1848" LastEditDate="2016-07-21T20:19:47.533" LastActivityDate="2016-11-01T14:12:32.027" Title="What are the standard espresso parameters (dose, mass/volume, time, etc.)?"
